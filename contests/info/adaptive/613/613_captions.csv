We are authorized to use farce, if necessary.
Unless you want a very long ride in a very small car, I suggest you start talking.
Oh, you'll laugh. They all laugh.
Don't make us go for the juggler.
If you think he's a clown, wait until you meet your public defender.
I’m going to need you to describe the perp to our balloon artist.
“I’m the carrot. He’s the stchick”.
If you want to see a giraffe, we're going to need more a lot more information.
You are in Canada sir. Its good cop, funny cop.
Does it look like we're joking?
Johnson, I don't think you understand. I am the good cop.
Yes he does do Bar Mitzvahs, but from now on I’ll ask the questions.
Does this look like a joke to you?
He'll pull a confession right out of you, kid, along with two dozen handkerchiefs and a nickel.
He can be the bad cop, or the good cop, it depends on your childhood.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the creepy way.
The courts said our interrogations were cruel and unusual so what we do now is just unusual.
Start talking or we bring in the mime.
Roberts....make me a chair. We are going to be here a while.
He doesn't just do that to balloons, ya know.
Son, the whole thing was witnessed by 23 officers in the stake-out car.
Either talk to us, or we bring in the mime!
What makes you think this is a joke?
Does this look like the dog that threatened you?
That's right, Ruffles was working for us the whole time.
Trump University.........Why do you ask?
Does he look like he's joking?
You're about to find out why some people are afraid of clowns.
It's more of a "good cop/vaguely disturbing cop" kind of thing.
We can do this the hard way, or the hardy har har way.
Last chance for you to come clean before we go for the juggler.
Maybe a night in the bouncy house will loosen your tongue!
If you cannot afford your own clown, one will be provided for you.
The rest of the force will be here soon. They're still getting out of the squad car.
As you can see, punk, we aren't afraid to use excessive farce.
Trust me kid, I am the good cop.
We can do this easy way or the hardy har har way.
Still won’t talk, huh? Ron, make a Dobermann!
Not cruel exactly, just unusual.
Do you think we're here for your amusement?
Don't make him put on the big shoes
That's OFFICER Bozo to you.
All right, I'm gonna need you to describe your accomplice to the ballon artist.
He has a whole act. Your choice.
We had to twist some arms but your little balloon friend just gave you up.
I'm going to ask you one more time, Is today your birthday?
We have ways of making you laugh.
Now you've done it, They sent in the clown.
Trust me. You don't want me to send in the bad clown.
Your lawyer is here.
There's 20 more just like him, outside in a little car.
Anything you laugh at can and will be used against you.
Start talking or we bring in the mime.
And there's a lot more of us in the little police car outside.
This is the description of the dog that attacked you?
Be a shame if anything happened to the little doggie...
Oh, sure. And I suppose the next thing you're going to tell me is that there's a clown behind me.
We can twist this any way we want.
He has a pin....and he’s not afraid to use it.
I'm NYPD; he's Homeland Security.
It doesn't matter how many times you ask for a lawyer, kid. The choices are poodle, sword, or flower.
Listen, kid, start talking or I'll send in the ENTIRE Republican Congressional leadership.
Well, I don't like bring-your-dad-to-work-day either!
If you don’t start talkin’, the dog gets it.
And if he doesn't break you, we've got forty-five others waiting in the car.
Does my partner here look like he’s concerned about your civil rights?
Not now, Bob. I’m in the middle of an interrogation.
My partner here likes twisting balloons and people, and he's all out of balloons.
Don't make me call in our mime.
Don't make me get the mime.
No, he's not going to make a giraffe till I get some answers!
Tell us what we want to know and nothing happens to the dog.
Even if he looks and acts like a clown, you will refer to him as Mr. President.
Sure, you have the right to remain silent. But a little polite laughter is appreciated.
What do you mean, you're not sure whether or not you took LSD?
Keep it up buddy. I deal with clowns like you every day.
We have ways to make you laugh.
Do you think this is some kind of joke?
It’s the best version of ‘Good Cop’ we could get on such short notice.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hardy-har-hard way.
...you have the right to entertainment. If you cannot afford entertainment, entertainment will be provided for you...
It's not just balloons he twists into funny shapes.
'We can do this the easy way, or the silly way'
If Detective Chuckles says it's a police dog it's a police dog.
Did you see what Mr. Clown did with that balloon? Now, let me ask you again...
Just tell him it's a giraffe so we can all go home.
There is no good cop. It's bad cop and really creepy cop
He's right behind me, isn't he?
Tell us the truth son, and I'll make him stop.
Do you want to talk now, or do I have to bring in the mime?
We can do this the easy way, or the funny way.
You don't want to find out which one of us is the bad cop.
And wipe that smile off your face!
Isn't it rich? Aren't we a pair?
Look, I'm gonna cut you some slack this time, because my birthday party is starting.
You don't seem to realize the seriousness of your situation.
Alright, I tried to play nice. Now we're gonna do it Bobo's way.
OK, we're tired of playing games.
Son, make it easy on yourself. Don’t make him put on the big shoes.
I know what you're thinking. Is he a clown in a cops suit, or cop in a clowns suit? Well, do you feel lucky, punk? Do ya?
So there was NOTHING behind your ear?
Don’t make him get the big shoes!
What do you take us for? Clowns?
Really, pal? What kind of Bozos do you take us for?
Look. We can do this the easy way. Or the hard dee har way.
Don't make us get the shoes.
There’s 16 others just like him waiting in the car downstairs, so you better talk!
If you don't cooperate Mr. Barnes, things are going to get real funny, real fast.
Don’t make me bring the mime out here.
I warn you, my partner doesn't have my sense of humor.
Detective Chuckles, go get the pie.
We’ve got ways of making you laugh.
You think this is some kind of a joke!
Talk. Or we’ll bring in the mime.
Start talking or bubbles gets the pin.
Start cooperating or we bring in the mime.
This is not a joke, son. It's a metaphor!
Still won't talk, huh tough guy? Jenson...put on the big shoes...
Yes he can do a giraffe. Stop trying to change the subject.
Our sketch artist is sick today, but believe me, Chuckles is very accurate.
You tell us what we need to know, and the balloon is yours.
We know it was you. Stop trying to pin it on the Donkey.
I'd be careful. You're not the only psycho in this room.
You think this is a joke?
The sketch artist is out sick. Just describe what the perp looked like to our balloon artist.
We’ll have the last laugh, I can assure you.
We're going to put that stupid smile back on your face.
Talk! Or the little doggie gets it!
I'm not your worst nightmare -- he is.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
And if you won’t talk to him, there’s twenty more out in the car.
You don't talk, he pops the puppy.
Still think hallucinogens are fun?
Does he look like he's fooling around?
Believe it or not, I’m the good cop in this scenario.
Alright, I tried to play nice. Now we're gonna do it Bobo's way.
Sooner or later, you're gonna laugh.
You think we’re here for your amusement?
The sketch artist is on vacation, just describe what the guy looked like and Officer Chuckles here will do his best.
You can talk to me or I can leave you alone with Chuckles. Your choice.
Good cop. Bad prop.
It's clowns like him who keep clowns like you off the streets.
I'm officer Barnum. He's Bailey.
Where were you on the night of your fifth birthday?
My partner here, he likes to make things squeak. You like squeaking?
You still seem to think this is some kind of joke.
Talk ... or I bring in the mime!
You’re innocent huh? What do you think we are, a couple of bozos?!
You'd better tell me now, once he gets on his unicycle I can't help you
We have ways of making you chuckle.
Talk, or he’ll become your worst nightmare.
The tail was longer.
How'd you think you'd get away with it? You must think we're a bunch of bozos.
It’s going to get worse for you. He’s also a mime.
Is this the dog that assaulted you, sir.
Now we can do this the easy way, or I can get the mime.
What if he made the ears a little shorter and the tail a little longer, THEN would it look like the man who assaulted you?
This clown is actually your attorney, we don't do good cop/bad cop anymore.
Oh, you'll talk. He knows every trick in the book.
Actually, smart guy, I'M the good cop.
According to our expert, you're one twisted puppy.
Our sketch artist is out today.
Spill the beans or we pop your friend.
You'd better come clean. I've got eighteen more getting out of the squad car now.
Listen buddy... if clowns can run nations they deserve a shot at detective work too.
Talk or the clown releases the dog.
That’s not what I meant by good cop, Gerald.
Look, I'm sorry the sketch artist is out sick today, but this is the best we could do on short notice, so just answer the question. Does this look like the dog that bit you or not?
We can do this the easy way or we can do this the terrifying phobia from your childhood way.
Say that with a straight face
Guess who's the bad cop.
We can do this the hard way, or we can do it the creepy way.
Start talking or we're bringing in the mime.
We have ways of making you laugh.
Going for the insanity plea, huh? We both know there's no one in this room but me and you.
Our forensics budget is a little tight. Does this look like the dog that bit you?
And there are 12 more just like him in a tiny squad car.
Do we look like fools to you?
I follow the Geneva Convention. He doesn't. Your choice.
Don't make us bring in the Mime!
Tell us, or the balloon gets it
You think he's scary? I got 12 more just like him in the car.
Yeah, he’s a clown. A laughing-on-the-outside, violating-your-constitutional-rights-on-the-inside clown.
I'll ask you one more time. Do you call this art?
I know my partner looks like a clown, but he does have a degree in criminology ... from Trump University.
Seriously Officer, I'm not high, it's right behind you.
Do you really want this guy twisting your arm?
He's not being The Good Cop. He's just an idiot.
This is as tough as we're allowed to be with you Millennials.
Welcome to your first day in the Witness Protection Career Development Program
You can talk to me now, or we'll let my partner have a little fun with you.
Is there some reason I don't have your full attention?
You gonna talk or do I have to bring in the mime?
Yea, I know, but his father in law is the police commissioner
WHY ARE YOU NOT TAKING US SERIOUSLY?
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
Are you sure it was a dachshund ?
Where were you on the night of Timmy's birthday party?
Don’t make me send for a mime!
You wanna play games? We can play games.
No, he is not the president.
We've got all day and a lot more balloons.
Get your story straight, kid. Your buddy in the next room said it was a horsie.
Tell us where you hid his big shoes or the balloon dog dies.
Now talk or the dog gets popped
This is what 6 months of community service will look like.
Who are you calling a clown?
Maybe getting squirted by a flower will help jog your memory!
Confess, and I'll make him go away.
What you’re failing to comprehend is...I’m the “good cop.”
Is this the dog who ate your homework?
Alright, we can do this the easy way or the hardy-har-har way.
Oh, you'll talk. My partner here has a few tricks up his sleeve.
... but if you cannot afford a balloon animal, one will be provided for you.
Do we look like we're playing around?
We have ways of making you laugh, punk.
For the record, we're all scared of him.
No, I'm the bad cop. He's just bad at being a cop.
I only see one sad clown in here, smart ass.
We fired the sketch artist, but the balloon artist is really good.
Now, are you going to tell me where the hallucinogens are? Or am I going to have to get a second cop in here?
Last guy in here died laughing; I'm just saying . . . .
Nope! It's bad cop, worse cop.
Give us the truth, or the puppy gets the pin.
Your pal cooperated, and he got a doggy, a bunny, and a horsey.
Clown to the left of me, joker to the right, here I am stuck in the middle with you.
There is no good clown.
Is this funny to you?
We can do this the easy way, or the way that involves an impossibly small car and twenty-nine more officers just like this one.
What makes you think he's the good cop?
Something amuse you?
You don't want to be here when he runs out of balloons.
Bad cop. Creepy cop.
Humor us.
Tell us what you know or we're bringing in the mimes next.
I don't think that you realize how serious this is.
Okay buddy, we're done clowning around.
Don't try anything funny.
O.K., what'll it be. Bad cop, or creepy cop?
Looks like you’re going to the Bounce House, fella.
Balloonistics just made a match. You're one twisted puppy, kid.
What do mean Whose the clown? That's the leader of the free world sonny boy."
Humor us.
In case you were wondering, I'm the good cop.
Stop hallucinating and answer the question.
Don't try to con us. My partner here knows every trick in the book.
Listen pal, we can do this the easy way, the hard way, or the fun but slightly dark and twisted way
That's SEARGENT Bozo to you, punk.
Make me a pair of handcuffs, Detective Boingo.
Do you think we're here for your amusement?
There’s a clown behind me? Right. Look, kid, I’m not falling for that again.
Talk or we'll pop the puppy.
OK, you got your balloon animal. Now where were you last Tuesday?
Who's the funny guy now?
Oh him? Budget cutbacks. So does this look like the dog that bit you?
You're running out of time - my partner has a bar mitzvah in an hour.
Of course you're in trouble, clowns always mean trouble.
This is Officer Parches, our balloon artist. Does this look like the dog that bit you?
Alright, was this the dog that bit you?
Are you willing to take a pie detector test?
Still not talking? Send in the mime.
Talk, or the clown stays.
Here's the bad news: I'm the GOOD clown!
This will go easier for you if you start talking before he comes back with the pie.
That was in the old days, pal. Now it's just bad cop, and really bad cop.
President Trump's staff has some questions for you also.
We have circus-stantial evidence.
Technically, this isn’t torture.
What, you think this is funny?
This is no laughing matter.
Trust me son, this is no laughing matter.
Trust me. You don’t want to see what comes after ‘Send in the clowns.’
Does it look like I'm joking??
I'm not here to humor you.
We can make these charges stick. All he has to do is rub them against his shirt really fast.
Now talk or he sings!
Trust me, kid. We have ways of making you laugh.
Chief said you requested a therapy dog.
You think we can’t make it more unpleasant for you than this? Lou, bring in the mime.
I'll ask you once more, did he look like Jeff Koons or Ronald MacDonald?
Oh, he’ll crack. Get your flower squirter.
This is your last chance, confess or we bring in the mime!
Don't try anything funny.
Chief said you requested an emotional support animal.
Our sketch artist took the day off and Chuckles is all we could get on short notice. Does this look like the dog that attacked you?
Our sketch artist is out sick.
Does that look like the dog that bit you?
This is Murphy. He just transferred in from Juvenile.
I'm sorry our sketch artist is out of town. Does this look like the dog that attacked you?
Officer Slappy does not appreciate you comparing him to The President.
We can stay as long as it takes, there’s eight more just like him in the car.
You squeal or he pops the poodle.
No more Mr. Nice Guy. You tell us, or Bozo here pops Snoopy.
You gonna come clean, or do we bring in the mime?
My partner says he found this behind your ear...
Can you show me where the dogsitter touched your pet?
If you don’t cooperate, we have no choice but to send in the clowns.
My partner knew 23 of the people in the car you blew up.
Well yes, we are running a circus here.
You got two choices, kid: the easy way, or the creepy way.
If you don’t talk, we’ll send in the clowns. Oh wait, they’re already here.
...And if the DNA comes back positive, you’re looking at 25 to life, pal. That being said, happy birthday!
Can you show us where he touched your dog?
No! I'm the good cop. He's a clown.
Alright son, show me where the man touched your dog.
You have the right to remain silent. You don't have to laugh.
No, moron, I’m the good cop!
If you talk he'll let you keep it.
Bad cop; Disturbing cop
NO! I'm not the bad cop! Why do people keep saying that?!
So, you gotta ask yourself: Is he a good clown or a bad clown.
HR said we should revise our interrogation techniques when dealing with millennials.
You better talk, or my partner here gets out the seltzer bottle.
In case you haven't guessed, he's the good cop.
Son, I don’t even know what ironic means.
Lookit! We're not clowning around here. Well, _I'm_ not clowning around.
Boy! Don't make me go and get the bad clown.
If you don't start talking, it'll get all kinds of weird in here.
Don’t make him get the seltzer.
Don't make us play good cop, fell-short-of-my-parent's-expectations cop.
OK! We're done clowning around.
Officer Bozo tends to take the 'Bad Cop' role in weird, comedic, directions.
Every time you tell a lie, a balloon animal dies.
He's from the new Justice Department.
Listen, kid, I’d like to go easy on you, but my partner here wants to twist you into a green poodle.
We can keep this up all day. We have 100 more just like him in a jalopy downstairs.
Spill or he does the full act
I'm the bad cop and he's the sick and twisted cop.
We can do this the easy way with me, or the hard way with Detective Bobo.
Now I’ll ask you again: how many people did you see leave the car?
Give us a name and we'll do your son's birthday party...
We can't waterboard any more. But no one said anything about water ballooning.
Your wife’s on the balloon phone , sir.
I hate clowns too, but either you confess or I will bring in the mime.
Oh yeah. You think this is funny? We'll show you funny.
You have the right to remain unamused.
We do suicides, homicides, weddings, birthday parties...
You expect us to believe that?! Do we look like a bunch of Bozos?!
Lately, the precinct has been under fire for its questionable interrogation tactics. So, let me introduce you to Officer Happy, your emotional support clown. Now, tell us what you know, or he follows you home.
You don't want to find out what else he can do with balloons, trust me.
Let's just say the Geneva Convention says nothing about clowns.
I heard it's your birthday.
“Wrong. He’s the Bad Cop”.
Talk or the dog gets it.
Believe me, we have ways of making you laugh.
I'm the good cop. He's the sad, tragic cop.
What part of "good cop, clown cop," don't you understand?
If you don't start talking, things are going to get serious.
Guess who's the bad cop.
What kind of clowns do you take us for?
Wait until you see what's up his sleeve.
Now, we can do this the easy way or the sad way.
You’re lucky I didn’t go for the juggler!
And if you confess to everything, he'll make you a giraffe.
The case has just taken a new twist.
Webster was undercover at your party. We know everything
We found this condom at the scene.
Why does everyone think that I'm the bad cop?
Isn't it rich, isn't it queer!?
If I don't get the confession I want, he'll do another two hours.
Start talking before Mr. Chuckles becomes Mr. Knuckles.
Do you want to talk to me, or my friend, and his little friend?
We know how to deal with clowns like you.
I'm asking for the last time. Where's Waldo?
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be contorted for you.
Talk or we put the squeeze on the dog
Next, make a lawyer.
I’m going to ask you one last time and I strongly suggest you answer. Is this a puppy or a reindeer?
No, really. I'm the good cop.
Actually, I'm the good cop.
You suppose wrong. I'm actually the good cop.
He's here in case you try something funny
You got what you asked for, Sondheim. Now talk.
Okay, I'm done here-be aware that my partner doesn't share my sense of humor
Listen pal, we can do this the easy way or the creepy way
You’d better tell us everything before the case becomes a full-blown media circus
So, you think we're here just for your amusement?
You'd better start talking. We've got dozens more just waiting to pile out of the squad car.
One way or another, pal, we're gonna get you to crack.
There are 19 more of him in the police cruiser parked outside, so you better start talking!
Did you know your daughter's birthday clown was working undercover?
Did he look like this?
Our sketch artist is on vacation.
Confess or I will leave you three alone.
He usually works juvie.
You think you can talk to my partner like he's some kind of Bozo?
next we lock you in the room and play "a small world after all" on a continuous loop!
You’d be surprised how hard it is to find a “good cop” these days.
You better talk, or next we'll bring in the mime.
You're going to regret that I had to send in the clown.
Go ahead punk, make my birthday.
Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? It's Query the Clown and his balloon dog, Pierre.
It’s Officer Bozo to you!
Give it up. My partner found the drugs.
Don't bother... he's here.
Good Cop / Could go either way Cop.
We can do this the hard way, or the hardy har har way.
You can talk to me or deal with Bobo. And Bobo just ran out of balloons.
Do I look like I’m clowning around?
If you don't cooperate, your next interrogator will be a mime.
Our sketch artist is out sick today...is this the dog you saw?
You think waterboarding is torture?
Wipe that smile off your face!
Don’t make me send in the clown.
Oh, you're gonna laugh, and you're gonna laugh loud.
The killer had a very distinct laugh. We'll get it out of you one way or another.
No, you listen punk; like I’m going to believe that the killer clown’s behind me.
Does he look like he's joking?
Oh? You think I'm the bad cop?
I won't hurt ya, but my friend over here has a pretty sick sense of humor.
Let's make this quick. My partner is juggling a full case load.
Talk or the poodle dies
If he can’t break you, I have thirty-six more waiting in the cruiser.
That's right, he was working undercover at the birthday party you crashed.
Sure, you have the right to remain silent, but do you have the ability?
Remember when I told you it wasn't going to be fun and games in here? Well, I lied.
Now answer the question or the clown stays.
I’m through clowning around. That’s more my partner’s thing, anyhow.
..so you see clowning around with a condom is no laughing matter son.
That's what he did to the last guy.
Welcome to the witness protection program.
‘What did you call my partner?’
I’ll ask you one more time before I go and get the rest of them out of the car.
...If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
The bad cop is on vacation.
Understand one thing, punk. I'm the good cop in this little scenario.
It's "Detective" Chuckles to you, young man.
We can make this easy. Or we can make this hardy har har.
Isn't it rich? Aren't we a pair?
You see something funny, Robert?
We can do this the easy way, or the funny way.
I'll ask you one last time, is that a horsey or a doggie?
Did this Bozo you described maybe look something like this?
Ohhh...and I suppose you think this is funny too, right?
If we're to have a prayer of finding your attacker, our balloon artist is going to need a much better description.
You give me a name, I give you a Happy Meal.
Start talking or my partner will use enhanced humor methods.
Ever since they banned waterboarding we've had to be more creative.
You'd better start giving me answers, or the next thing my partner twists into a cute little animal won't be your balloon.
Start cooperating or I’ll turn you over to this Bozo!
You should know we have ways of making you laugh...
He does birthday parties and indictments.
A lot of us have side jobs.
We found your fingerprints all over it.
Good Cop, Batshit Crazy Cop!
Maybe a few minutes in the bounce house will refresh your memory.
Do you think this is all fun and games!?
We're saving him for the President Trump interrogation.
President Trump has volunteered to give you some legal advice ...
Fine, deny you stole the car, but we got 40 witnesses in the back seat.
What makes you so sure I’m the bad cop?
Alright, this is my partners last balloon. Is this the dog you saw leaving the scene or not?
Trust me, balloons aren't the only thing he can twist.
Coulrophobia. C-O-U-L-R-O-P-H-O-B-I-A. Look it up, punk.
I can do this all day, but Officer Yorick is a fellow of finite jest.
You either start talking, or I'm going to turn you over to this clown.
Actually, he's the bad cop, but a surprisingly good clown.
Because the composite sketch guy is on vacation. Now, is this the dog you saw the night of the murder?
You think you're funny? I'll show you funny.
Tell that to the jury. Sargent O'Donnell says he had 37 witnesses in his patrol car that would identify you as the perp!
What makes you think this is a joke?
My partner also has the right to remain silent.
No, I am the good cop.
"Good cop, bad clown" is a lesser known, but highly effective interrogation technique.
You hear that Carl? He thinks this is some kind of joke.
You think I'm clowning around?
It's Suspect Appreciation Day.
What happened to that balloon wasn’t an accident
Our sketch artist is away, does your missing dog look like this?
My partner here is going to see if he can twist your arm.
Oh no. He’s just on temporary loan from the White House.
We’re nowhere near done with you, we’ve still got magic tricks and the unicycle.
If you think you can make clowns of us, I warn you it's been done!
Won't talk, huh? Ditch the dog, Happy, and get the seltzer.
If you give us a name, we will call off the dog.
He's from our Not Very Serious Crime Unit
Ok, tough guy.. you can make this easy and talk to the "good cop", or take your chances with Pennywise here...
You think you're funny? I'll show you funny.
Just think about this: I'm the good cop.
We're done clowning around, tell us or your little wiener dog says "bye-bye".
we've found good cop, sad cop works better.
Start talking or you'll see what happens to the balloon.
As you can see this is no laughing matter.
You think this is rough? Trust me, you do NOT want him to put on the shoes.
So, are you gonna talk? Or does my partner here have to make you a hat?
Believe me, you don't want to see 'bad clown',
Does this look like a joke to you?
You'll be working for Earl-- he's our last clown. The previous one became president.
No, it’s not all fun and games here.
We have ways of making you talk. But this isn't one of them.
You RANSOMED the birthday piñata???
Don't make me resort to face painting.
Oh, tough guy huh? Alright, bring in the Mime!!
After this, he goes for the seltzer .. and then .. pies! Oh yes, there will be pies!
It's San Francisco. Here we have a bad cop and a fun cop.
Did you see what he did with that balloon? You're next!
O.K Sonny, what’ll it be? The Big House or the Fun House?
Ok wise guy. We know how to deal with clowns like you.
‘There’s 11 more of them in a squad car outside, so I suggest you start talking.’
You really don’t want me to leave you alone with this clown!
If we can't make you talk we'll at least make you smile.
The sketch artist has the day off. Work with me here.
I'm going to ask you one more time. Did you, or did you not, try to pass that dachshund off as a labradoodle?
Do I look like a clown to you?
No, it's good cop, creepy cop.
What do you mean the trial was a circus?
Surprise, HE'S the bad cop!
Enough clowning around with you, buddy! I have a pie and I'm not afraid to use it!
Give us some answers kid, don’t make us use the pin.
After what he just did to that innocent, little balloon, you still think he's the 'good cop?'
What clown?
We ran out of Good Cops.
Do you think I’m here to amuse you?
Yes, it's cruel, but it isn't unusual.
Somethin' funny?
That's right. HE'S the bad cop.
OH, BY THE WAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
You will now undergo a polylaugh test.
You're lucky, Detective B'Ozo wants to charge you as a juvenile."
Kid, does it look like my partner is here to entertain you?
This seem like a joke to you?
Bad news - I'M the good cop.
Tell us what we want to know or we pop the dog.
You better worry, because I'm the "Good Cop"
Good cop, bad cop was feeling a little stale.
Talk now, or we bring in the mime!
And I say YOU'RE the one who's acting like a Bozo, young man.
According to your driver’s license, today is your birthday.
What do you mean funny, funny how?
Now your final test as nominee for Secretary of State
OK son, can you explain Facebook to the Congressman again.
Keep this up and you will also be facing a media circus.
Im bad cop. He is worse cop.
Is this your dog?
I hope you didn't just call my partner what I think you just called my partner.
There are 28 more just like him waiting in the squad car downstairs.
You might as well talk. Your accomplice has already squeaked.
You're lucky we're charging you as a juvenile.
Unless you want to relive your 6-year-old birthday party you’d better cooperate.
You think this funny? I’ll show you funny.
No, he can't make you a sword.
Do we really look that stupid?
It’s not that weird. Everyone has emotional support animals these days.
Better start talking or I'm bringing in the mime...
Is this an accurate depiction of the dog in question?
You think I’m scary, wait until you meet my partner.
He can use seltzer in ways that never leave a mark.
Start talking now or the juggling bear comes out next.
I get the feeling you're not taking us seriously.
Tell us the truth, or you'll be getting a very unhappy meal.
What makes you think he's the good cop?
You think this is all a big joke, don't you?
Don’t make me pop it.
Confess, or I'll turn you over to "Tickles".
Give us a name, and we’ll throw in some cotton candy.
Talk to us, or your friend here gets popped.
My partner tends to overplay the good cop role
Enough clowning around. Let's see how you hold up against the K9 unit.
You can laugh at my partner but he just broke the stolen piñata case wide open!
Save it, carny. We had a man on the inside the whole time!
If we don't get some answers quick, I'm sending in the mime.
Is this all a big joke to you?
Our corrections officer knows every trick in the book.
Balloons aren't the only thing he can twist into silly shapes!
The good cop is off today. This is the best we could come up with.
Okay, tough guy... You really want me to bring out the mime?
Good luck remaining silent.
Confess or we send in the mime.
Now you're probably wondering, "Who's this Bozo?"
Yes he's the good cop. Its just that he's not a very good good cop
We have other ways of making you talk.
He also plays the accordion, if you won't talk.
Listen kid, don't make me send in the bad clown.
Don't make me get the mime.
ONLY because it's your birthday.
...and if you don’t cooperate there’s a lot more like him back in the squad car.
What the hell are you laughing at?
Trust me. You don't want the good cop.
Don’t make me bring in the face painter.
You think this is funny?
What do you take us for?
Actually ,it's bad cop, worse cop.
You have the right to remain silent. As long as you can keep a straight face.
You know the sound of a balloon getting twisted--Mario can do that all night.
Talk or we'll send in the mime next
Yeah? What else do you see? Am I a clown, too?
There is no good clown.
Oh, I'm sorry, is Circus Jail just one big joke to you?
We have ways of making you chuckle.
I'll ask you one more time-- do you recognize that dog?
Did you just call him a bozo?
Do we look like we're clowning around?
For an extra $45 you can have a tape of this interrogation to share with your kids.
So you deny trying to steal Bozo's service animal?
You think we brought you in just for fun?
You may not believe it, but my partner’s not as stable as I am.
The easy way or do we need the slapstick?
Dammit, I said look at me when I'm talking to you!
We couldn't get a sketch artist but I assure you my partner is a professional.
My partner here has a way of making kids squeal.
No, it's not torture according to the latest court ruling.
So latex sensitive are we? Don't make me send in the clown.
This was found at the crime scene; our expert recognized your work.
I bet you're thinking were just a bunch of clowns.
We know how to deal with clowns like you.
That's right, Johnson here was undercover the whole time. Why?! Because art plagiarism is a serious crime Mr. Koons!
Let me tell you this up front, buddy — he’s the bad cop.
Ok, Come clean or you get 4 hours of this guy and then a mime.
We can do this the easy way . . . or whatever it is that he does.
Don’t make him get out the seltzer.
Tell us where Waldo is and no one gets hurt.
Sorry, our sketch artist is on vacation.
You’re lucky it’s your birthday.
Young man, Agent Adams is going to teach you how to be the President of the United States.
Anything you say will be used in his act.
Unfortunately for you, I'm the good cop.
. . .and he can get 26 officers in one car.
I’ve got a carload of these guys, all dying to take a crack at you.
Now you would hate to see something happen to little doggy, wouldn't you?
You wanna play games, pal?
If you insist on a trial, the President's lawyer will be your court-appointed counsel.
We can do this the fun way, or the funnier way
It's up to you: This can be really hard or really funny.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hardy-har-hard way.
And for your own good, keep in mind that I'm the good cop.
That’s our final offer. Give us a name you get the dog. For a swan you have to wear a wire.
Tell me more about this gang. You say they’re called the Ringling Brothers?
That's nothing compared to the shape you'll be in after Sergeant Bozo is through with you.
What are you looking at? Do you think this is funny?
Start talkin' or your balloon friend gets it
We're not clowning around here...yet.
We’re not here to entertain you.
You wouldn't like to meet my partner. He's got a funny way of doing things.
I don't think you grasp the seriousness of this situation
If you do not have a balloon dog, one will be appointed to you by the clown.
I'm finished clowning around with you, but apparently my partner isn't.
Do you think we're a couple of clowns, kid? Well, do you?
We can do this the easy way or we can do this the silly way.
And don't try anything funny, Kid. There's a lot more cops in that tiny car parked outside.
Where were you the night of the circus?
What can I tell you, the sketch artist is on vacation. Does this look like your missing dog or what?
He's a good cop and a great partner, but I hate it when we take his car to a crime scene.
I assure you we take this very seriously.
He makes you laugh, I make you cry.
Oh, him? He's here for emotional support.
Our sketch artist will work with you to come up with a balloon representation of the perp.
Listen you little punk, second degree manslaughter and a balloon animal is the best deal your going to get today
No, I'm the good cop. He's the very bad cop.
If this doesn't make you talk, we're prepared to bring in the mime.
We're not just fooling around here, mister.
You think this is some kind of joke!? Do we look like we’re kidding around?
What part of "he also works birthday parties" don't you understand?
No, I'm the bad cop and he is the funny cop.
Ya' askin' me what's next, what's next?: A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down the pants.
Show me on the balloon animal where the clown touched you.
Believe me, he will twist your arm.
You misunderstand ... I'M the good cop.
It's casual Friday.
Recognize him now?
Confess Bozo, or he pops the puppy!
Ok Jimmy, show's over.
Trust me. You don’t want to see him pop the ballon.
We don’t have a 'good cop'.
You don't know anything, huh? Well, we have ways of making you squeak.
Quit stalling pal, or the dog gets it.
He just got a confession out of that dog.
Listen bud, we're not clowning around.
What do you mean you didn't know he was cop?
Don't let him fool you, I'm the good cop.
WE'RE ASKING THE QUESTIONS MISTER! But, yes, Detective Fratellini does have a second job.
Turns out, I'm the good cop.
I'm going to step out for a minute, now, and you should know that my partner here is fresh out of party balloons.
Talk now, or we bring in the mime!
Yes - he is the Presidents pick for director of the FBI
Ok we have given you what you asked for, now tell us what we want to know.
Show us on the clown where the balloon dog touched you
Look here, young man, this is no laughing matter.
It’s either me, or your worst nightmare.
Joking? You think we're joking?
Not laughing now, are you punk?
First you confess, then you get the balloon dog.
Does this look like fun and games to you?!
There's twenty-two more in a little car back there if you don't like his questions.
What's so funny?
It's up to you son. You want to do this the easy way, or the ironic way?
He takes good cop to another level.
As you can see, we are ready to entertain any statement you are ready to make.
Unless you want to know how many more clowns are behind that door, I suggest you start talking.
We're trying something new, pal! It's called good cop/sad cop.
You only get to keep the balloon animal AFTER you've answered our questions.
This is not a circus.
No, actually -- he's the bad cop.
Something funny, punk?
Look, kid, we have ways of making you laugh.
We can promise you immunity if you're willing to wear a hand buzzer.
No, a llama. Officer Coco's unspoken questions are only going to get tougher, son.
No, I'm the good cop. Why do you ask?
If you won't talk, we might have to do some arm twisting.
Make no mistake, I'm the only guy between you and the seltzer.
Wait until you see what he can twist you into.
No, he’s the Bad Cop.
Can you describe him to our stretch artist?
Talk or the balloon gets it.
Start talking or we’ll send in the rest of the clowns.
No, he’s the good cop. The bad cop is the mime.
You are sentenced to 30 days of community circus.
Don't make me bring in the elephant.
First of all, it's 'Officer' Bobo. And secondly, no he will not make you a phone to call your lawyer.
You have the right to remain silent - but you won't be able to once you see his act.
The Canine Unit has taken the biggest hit from the recent budget cuts.
That’s Detective Sergeant Bozo to you, punk!
I did not kill Cathy & I don't believe that's her clown.
Talk, or I'll let him do card tricks.
Start talking, or I am turning you over to the Clown.
No, I'm the good cop. He's Jeff Koons.
If I need reinforcements, there’s forty more like him in a squad car out front.
For a full confession, he can make that a reindeer.
Does your missing dog look like this?
What do you think this is? Some kind of a joke?
If you don’t talk, my partner’s gonna get sad. You wouldn’t like him when he’s sad.
For you it's bad cop, worse cop.
Do you wanna talk to me ...or do you wanna take your chances with a man that would do that to a cute little balloon.
Show us exactly where he asked you to sniff.
How can we believe you when you can’t even keep a straight face?
... or the doggie gets it.
Sure, you have the right to remain silent -- but I'd laugh if I were you, smartguy.
what other detective?
I'm bad cop, he prefers not to be labeled.
Where on the balloon did you touch the dog?
Don't make me put you in the bouncy house!
This is Officer Bubbles of the K-9 unit. Don't make him use his slapstick.
You think this is all fun and games, Punk?
Don't make me bring in the juggler.
You think we're clowning around, don't you?
Listen, we can either do this the hard way or the funny way.
Sorry, he doesn’t do lawyers...just doggies and snakes.
What? You think being a detective covers the bills?
Talk! Or we bring in the mime. You decide.
And if you tell us what we want to know, we'll let you use the bouncy house.
You probably think we're just a bunch of Bozos.
Start talking or the puppy gets popped.
Well, if you didn't make the balloon animal, then who did?
Trust me he's not the good cop...
You don't seem to understand the seriousness of your crime.
Don't make him put on the shoes.
Don't make me subject you to excessive farce.
Don’t bother, they’re here.
Do we look like we're joking, kid?
Talk or the clown kills your Mr. Binky.
I'm telling you, we're not clowning around here.
Clancy is modeling the only witness protection identity we have left —take it or leave it !
Don't make us play good cop, fell-short-of-his-own-expectations cop.
Yes, 'shrooms' are known to cause strange hallucinations. Why do you ask?
We're done clowning around. Now talk!
Well, are we having fun, yet?
They say to dress for the job you want, not the job you have
Officer Chuckles found your balloon animal at the crime scene. Not so funny now, is it?
A lawyer, eh? We'll need more balloons, but I think we can make that for you.
Does it look like we're clowning around?
You've got ten seconds to talk, or I leave the room, and let Binky go full Ringling on you.
Our sketch artist called in sick.
As you can see, we do good cop, bad cop a little differently around here.
Does THAT jog your memory?
I'll let you decide if he's good or bad
We can do this the hard way or we can do this the fun way.
The media is waiting for your statement. It's a circus out there!
What are you, 5? I said, look at me when I’m talking to you.
If you won't talk to me, my partner has a few tricks he would like to try.
As a matter of fact, we ARE playing "Good Cop, Bad Cop." Guess who's who.
Give up 3 more witnesses, and he'll make you a flower.
We can do this the easy way or the squeaky way, your choice.
We don't do Good Cop, Bad Cop anymore. We do Bad Cop, Cop Who Will Haunt Your Nightmares.
What makes you so sure I’m the bad cop?
Tell the truth or we'll pop this dog
Oh yeah-and there's a joker to my right!
I'd advise you to come clean to the clown. You don't want to have to talk to the mime . . .
If you give us any trouble, I’ve got twenty partners in the squad car outside.
Tell what you know or the balloon dog gets it
Maybe a pie in the face would change your story!
You think this is funny? I'll show you funny.
Confess or we bring in the mime!
You either talk to us, or we bring in the mime.
No, I'm the good cop. Why do you ask?
And if you don't want to hear that squeaky noise again, Start Talkin'
We can do this the funny way or the creepy way.
OK, tell him where you buried the other balloon dogs.
Chuckles has ways for making you talk.
Send in the clowns. Don't worry, they're here.
We're not clowning around here! Well ... at least I'm not.
You have the right to say Stop during a tickle.
Ya better start talkin', cause my friend here, will twist you like that cute little dog!
If you think we're clowning around, punk, you're very much ... Peters! This is NOT the time!
Sorry. Our regular sketch artist is on maternity leave.
Oh, you find this amusing, do you?
Think he's a laugh, huh? Just wait until tou meet your court-appointed lawyer.
Just how limber are you?
What makes you think I'm the bad cop?
The bad news is, I'm the good cop.
I told you, you get the poodle when you stop giving me the runaround.
First you answer the questions, then he makes you a bicycle. Got it?
If you're going to clown around, we're going to clown around.
Let me tell you son, the Geneva Convention don't say nothing about cruel and unusual squeaking
This is our 3-D specialist. Does this look like your dog?
TRUST ME! HE IS THE BAD COP!!
You'd better start taking this seriously.
I'll ask one last time — where did you hide the LSD?
Does Officer Giggles look like he's joking around right now?
I don't think you appreciate the seriousness of this situation!
The precinct is experimenting with Good Cop, Creepy Cop. After the interrogation, we’d appreciate your feedback.
Does it look like we’re clowning around, buddy?
Mr. Zuckerberg, we have advanced techniques for getting you to talk.
Look, we can do this the easy way or the odd way.
Talk or we untie the dog.
We need to know. How did you figure out he was an undercover cop?"
You think I’m the bad cop? Wait till you see what my friend Mr. Tickles does with his little balloon.
Do you realize how serious this is?
This meets the commission's requirement of diversity in the work force.
just to be clear, I am the 'good cop'
Yes, this is protocol for all new Oval Office interns. Now, pay attention.
Do you want him to put on the suit? And the shoes? Is that what you really want?!
Now, son, let me remind you, this is no laughing matter.
Are you ready to talk?? Or do we bring-in the mime???
Good cop, bad cop? Oh, we're way past that, buddy boy!
Does this accurately represent the dog you saw?
Listen, I thought the sketch balloonist was a bad idea, too, but budgets are tight.
Did he or did he not get the ears right?
Why do you immediately assume I'm the bad cop?
Listen, clown! Yes, I'm talking to you!
You wouldn’t want anything to happen to your dog, would you?
Do you think you are dealing with a bunch of clowns?
If you don't talk soon, Detective Bozo will do to you what he did to that balloon. He's dangerous.
You're in trouble, but not too serious.
Under the new administration, you also have the right to assistance of clownsel.
Talk or face seltzer water boarding.
Start from the top. The big top.
This is just a sample. If you dont talk were bringing in the accordion.
Good cop. Bad prop.
For every lie we’re going to start letting air out.
So, you think this funny?
Tell us what you know, or we'll stuff you into a car with 23 other suspects.
You better start talkin, we got a whole tiny car full o' these guys
NO the dog that bit me had a much longer tail
You don't want him to start juggling...do you?
I bet you thought I was the “bad cop.”
Now talk, or we bring in the mime!
Now pay attention as my partner mimes your Miranda rights.
Well, since we can't get you to talk, let's see if we can't make you laugh...
He's a loose cannon, which is also how he commutes to work.
Talk or we pop the dog!
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable talking to Officer McDonald.
If you don't talk, I am going to send in the clowns.
Won't talk? We will see about that. Officer Bozo here knows a thing or two about arm twisting.
If you don't cooperate we can entertain you indefinitely.
Let's go back to the scene of the mime, shall we?
Humor him. He's up for a White House job.
Give it up. It's your word against Detective Twinkles and the 17 other officers in the car tailing you.
You're next, pal.
Just like in the White House, you should be afraid of the clown.
Start talking or Bobo makes the balloon dog squeak. You ever heard a balloon dog squeak, Jimmy?
If you think 2 hours of talking to him was cruel, next we bring in a mime!!
Don't make him pull the quarter from behind your ear.
It's good cop, funny cop now.
You have the right to remain unamused.
Either you start spilling to me, or I’m gonna let Sgt. McDonald do it his way.
Listen buddy, we're not clowning around here. (long pause) He's standing right behind me, isn't he?
You'd be amazed what he can do with a small intestine.
Next, we'll bring in a Mime.
I'm bad cop, he's just a sad, sad man.
The balloon squealed.
You'll be tried as a juvenile.
What do you think this is? Some kind of a joke?
Let me totally clear. I'M the good cop!
Talk, or I bring in the unicyclist.
Did you hear that Sgt. MacDougal? This wiseguy thinks you’re a clown.
We can do this the easy way or the harlequin way.
He made the dog! So do we have a deal?
Do I look like a clown to you?
Believe me, you don’t want to have to deal with my partner.
And there are 20 five-year-olds waiting right outside.
Oh a serious guy huh? Well we have ways of making you laugh.
Meet Detective Columbozo.
That's right punk, first one who talks gets the balloon doggie.
I can assure you that this was indeed a laughing matter.
Alright, punk, start talking. I need adult conversation.
Now, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the painfully corny way.
NOW, do you recognize Detective Taylor??
HEY! Only the Mayor gets to call us clowns, ya hear!
Please show Officer Bobo what happened to your dog
Judy Collin's lawyer is here to see you
Does this look like a circus to you?
The fun and games are over, pal.
We treat every complaint seriously..
Our sketch artist is on leave, but you can describe the suspect to Officer Toodles.
No, he won't make you a phone so you can call your lawyer.
Oh, so you think this is funny?!
Who's that clown? He's your worst nightmare.
OK buddy ,it’s speak or squeak.
I'm asking for the last time: is that your dog?
Tell us what we need to know or the dog gets popped.
Our sketch artist isn't in today, does this look like the man that stole your wallet?
Despite what you’re thinking, this is no laughing matter.
Let´s think back, Patterson, to your fifth birthday. . .
Any other final requests?
If I don’t get the answers I’m looking for, Detective Popo is going to give the balloon a few more twists.
No more wise cracks, kid. Our regular sketch artist is out sick today, okay? Now, does this or does this not look like the the little doggie that bit ya?
And what makes you think we are clowning around?
Do you think this police department is a joke?
All we know is that you're allergic to latex. So, better start talking.
No, he’s the bad cop. I’m the good cop.
Is this all just a joke to you?
Maybe this will refresh your memory.
The mime is coming in next, he'll make you talk
We can do this the easy way or the squeaky way.
So you're absolutely sure that this is your dog ?
No, nitwit, he's the bad cop.
How many times I gotta tell ya? No cake and ice cream till you sign the confession.
Did you or did you not say..'send in the clowns'?
...and you're telling me this officer assaulted you with a slapstick?
Won't talk, eh? Well how about a couple of hours with this guy...
You think he is the good cop? The name Stephen King mean anything to you?
We're booking you on attempted rubbery.
I don't care what Sean Hannity told you, the clown ain't your lawyer.
Talk now or spend the next 48 hours making balloon animals with this guy.
Yeah, he's bad.
In case you're wondering - I'm the good cop.
He's doing the clown thing again, isn't he?
He’s only here in case you try something funny.
What makes you think he was just kidding?
Oh you think this is funny, huh? Well, we'll see who's laughing when Officer Chuckles is finished with his routine.
Without an animal-specific sketch artist available, this is as close as we can come to your canine assailant based on the description you've given us.
He’s not smiling on the inside.
I'm the funny one, it's him you have to worry about.
Yeah, and I'm the good cop.
No, buddy, I'm the Good Cop. He's...well, ever seen 'Halloween'?
Can we get you a happy meal?
Let's get one thing straight, punk! We're not here for your amusement!
Where were you on the night of April 1st?
Think that's funny, wise guy? Wait 'til he gets the pie.
You want to do this the hard way or the most fun way?
Because of your age, I must now turn the interview over to Officer Clowny, our specialist in juvenile interrogation.
That's his doggie. You don't want to see his crocodile.
Yes, you can have water, but don't be surprised if it's in a dribble cup.
You should be afraid. There are 50 more just like him behind the mirror.
Yeah, I'm the 'bad' cop. But believe me, you don't want to meet the 'good' cop.
Don't confess yet, all my other partners are still getting out of the car.
Exactly how much LSD did you take?!
We can do this the easy way or the squeaky way.
Don’t let the face fool you, he’s the bad cop!
You just had to get arrested during the captain’s birthday party, huh?
Don't even think of trying to twist this around.
And that's just a taste of what prison's like
Joke's on you...I'm the good cop!
Things aren't so funny now, are they kid ...
Give a complete description of the perpetrator to our balloon artist.
No, Bozo I’m talking to you.
You're not the first clown we've had in here.
This is Officer Bannon, Circus Crimes Division.
“Talk, or we'll bring in the mimes and accordionists.
It's your choice, either you talk to me or you talk to your worst nightmare.
Actually, we're both good clowns. And bad cops.
Believe me, balloon animals aren't the only the only thing he can twist.
Oh, I can ask Lieutenant Chuckles to stop, but if you don't start answering my questions, I'm bringing the mime back in.
Your choice: confess or 2 hours alone with the clown.
You don't want him to use the seltzer.
There's nothing funny about this, young man.
What are you looking at him for?
I'm done with you. But my partner might not be so nice
So, tough guy, you think you are funny? I'll show you who's funny.
You have the right to one balloon. If you cannot afford one, a poodle will be provided for you.
So, you think that's funny, do you? I'll show you funny!
When good cop/bad cop fails, we bring in the clown. Any other questions smart pants?
Trust me: you don't want to see the Bad Clown.
Do we look like a bunch of clowns to you?
If you don't talk, Peanuts takes a pin to the dog!
If you don't tell us what you know, I'll bring in the mime.
Still think this is a joke?
....and that's Lieutenant Jeffries from our Juvenile Division.
You think you are the class clown? I know the class clown. You are no class clown
Talk ... or there will be face painting.
We can do this the easy way or the har-har-hard way.
Look at me dammit! I'm talking to you.
Funny HOW?
We'll see who has the last laugh
Now, who's the Bozo?
Oh, I wish you hadn't laughed at him.
Are you sure he had a bushier tail?
So you wanna play hardball?, go ahead Jonesy make the balloon nightstick!
Talk or he'll squeak.
Let me introduce you to the really bad cop.
You can talk to me, or you can talk to Scruffles...
Tell me again, exactly how many of you were in the car?
Do you recognize this?
Stick to the subject! This is an interrogation room, not a circus!
Don't wanna talk eh? Fine, Kill the puppy Bobo!
He is the bad cop, and he can twist more than just balloons.
Even sketch artists get holidays, OK? So, does it or does it not look like Mrs Schwarz's dog?
And we have ten more just like him waiting out in the car.
Could you hurry up and confess? Wehave a birthday party to get to.
...And he just picked up 30 more of your accomplices in his cruiser
Is this the balloon animal that attacked your wife??
"If you don't cooperate, we'll have to throw the pie at you".
The bad news for you is that I’m the good cop.
We have ways of making you squeal!
We've got fifteen more just like him in the squad car outside.
Word of advice, kid- take the balloon dog or he gets out the big shoes.
You’re accused of clowning around and blowing things out of proportion.
So, we can do this the EASY way, or we can do this the FUNNY way...
Look, I’m trying to help you here, but he’s got a seltzer bottle and knows how to use it.
Did he look something like that?
And what, he just magically appeared behind you?
The driver of the car survived, but you killed seventeen passengers.
Johnson, looks like this guy wants to play games.
Oh, he's just getting started.
You think this is funny?
Clown college is hard time, son.
who are you calling a bozo now
OK, McCollough, we met your demands. Now talk!
No, he’s the Bad Cop.
If you want to enter the Witness Protection Program, and you want to stay in town, this is your best and only option.
No, that's supposed to be a dog, not a horse. And stop trying to change the subject - I'm the one asking the questions here.
We hear you're into twisted stuff.
Don't make us play good clown bad clown.
I said we can work this out by talking. But Artie here sometimes gets a little crazy.
If I find out you're lying to me, you can forget about the giraffe.
Officer Finn has ways to make you talk...you don’t even want to know about.
Does it look like we are clowning around here?
So you want Officer Doodles and I to believe this heroin-filled doggie just climbed up your ass?
No, I'm the bad cop and he's the bad clown.
Alright, mac, if you don't start spilling the beans, i'm gonna hand you over to this Bozo.
And if you don't talk, he keeps making them.
No, I'm the good cop...he's just a clown.
Unlucky for you, he and his canine partner showed up when they did.
We can do this the easy way or the har-har-hard way.
Well, what if I told you that your buddy in the next room wanted his face painted?
we're asking the questions here!
Looks can be deceiving. Ever heard of John Wayne Gacy?
He did a better job with Stormy Daniels’ description
So you think you can make clowns out of us, huh?
Bozo and I need your help...how do we get off Facebook?
You might as well confess now, kid--in two minutes we bring in the mime.
No, I'm actually the good cop.
Listen buddy, a lawyer just isn’t necessary. You don’t want two clowns in here, do you?
Your choice, bad-cop or tedious-clown
Who do you think you're dealing with, a bunch of clowns.
If you want your face painted you are going to have to start giving us answers.
First some answers. Then your juice box.
My partner knows how to handle jokers like you.
Can you explain how the boss's therapy dog ended up in your cubicle?
I don't think you understand which one of us is the bad cop...
He's a good cop, but a very bad clown.
Still won't talk? Let's see what he can pull from your ear.
The sketch artist is unavailable but he can make a balloon animal of the perp.
No, I'm the bad cop!
You are accused of defacing an officer of the law and wringing his dog's neck.
Is this some joke to you?
This is indeed a laughing matter.
You think this is my first circus?
I don't have a sense of humor like my partner.
We're through clowning around with you.
Let's see if Officer Koonz can wipe that smile off your face.
What is this, good cop, bad prop?
I don’t believe your story, but apparently my partner is willing to entertain it.
You wanted a Coke? My bad, thought you said joke....
Talk or I turn you over to that clown over there
We have ways of making you laugh, Mr. Tough Guy.
Let's get serious.
If you think i'm tough wait until this clown gets ahold of you.
You can talk to me now or you can talk to that Bozo later.
You can have it only if you're completely honest with me and tell the truth.
It's not polite to refer to police office with a badge as a bozo.
Who you're calling a clown kid?
Wrong! I'm the good cop.
You think this is funny?"" Wait til we break out the helium.
I can do this all night! Jerry, bring in the mimes...
Did you or did you not call him a clown?
Did you think you would talking to a pair of clowns today, Mr. Zuckerberg?
Sing or I send in the clown.
Well, no, not exactly a sketch artist, per se...
Look pal, we can do this the easy way, or the grotesquely comical way.
Listen, kid, this is no joking matter.
Do you have any idea how many of these guys are behind that mirror?
By the time he brings out the bicycle, you’ll talk.
Does this look sort of like the dog that bit you?
The good cop called in sick today, so you're in for a treat
I assure you this is no laughing matter!
This is our Forensic Clown. He will make a balloon replica of the dog that was stolen based on your description.
According to the president that guy represents the FBI
Look, we're not... I mean, I am not clowning around with you!
You said a dog ate your homework. Is this the dog?!
Who do you think we are? A bunch of clowns? JIM, NOT NOW
He had floppy ears? That'll be harder
We came here to do two things: solve crimes and make balloon animals. And we're all out of crimes.
Show me on the balloon animal where you stabbed him.
Mr. Cohen, my buddy here can make anyone squeak.
Clowning around is our job, and we take it very seriously.
Is that your story? You think we’re fools?
Are you calling Sergeant Egelko a clown?
You think this is something to laugh about, pal?
Who's Jeff Koons?
No, I'm the good cop. He's not even a good clown.
Don’t get smart kid. We are not clowning around!
This can happen the easy way, or the squeaky way.
So, now you're trying to tell me that there's a cop standing behind me, at the door, with a clown wig, a clown nose, and a dog balloon? And, you arrived at the Station in a Clown Car? You're going for an insanity defense already?
Young man, you do not seem to understand the seriousness of your situation!
Don't make me get the piñata!
We're not clowning around anymore. After this.
Little did you know we had an undercover agent at the party.
Listen Bozo, we're not clowning around anymore...this is serious.
You'd best talk to me or you get my partner who has serious and dark issues
Next stop for you is the bouncy house!
Frank, I swear, if I turn around and you're in that getup again...I just don't know what.
But you don’t have the right to remain unamused.
You think this is funny? Do you have any idea how many guys like you my partner has put behind imaginary bars?
You think this is funny, punk?
We're through clowning around.
Either you start talking, or Detective Blinky here goes to get his squirting flower!
Oh, yeah? Well, Chuckles here says it was you who killed at The Comedy Café last Saturday night.
You have the right to remain stoic.
That's right, your in Jeff Session's justice system.
This Career Day you'll get to see where being Class Clown will lead you.
It all started with a typo in the training manual: The "goof cop, bad cop" incident.
You want the balloon? I want to know who threw that pie.
My partner here is gonna wipe that smirk right onto your face.
Tell us, about how many would you say got out of the car?
So, do you want another 20 minutes of Freckles or are you ready to talk?
Perhaps this will refresh your memory
Tell us what happens or the clown hurts the dog
You have the right to remain silent and pretend he's the president.
We have ways to make you talk.
Our sketch artist retired.
If you think I'm scary, you really don't want to deal with my partner.
Dog means you're lying. I'd better start seeing some goddam giraffes.
He looks harmless, but his act is torture.
Talk or Officer Puddles will kill that dog.
The sketch artist was busy.
That's not the only thing he can twist into a fun shape.
Or would you rather tell it to a mime?
We heard it was your birthday.
Due to budget cuts, we can no longer afford the bad cop.
If you ever want to see your doggie again..............
Talk now or we send in the mime!
You won't believe where he'll pull a balloon from next.
Now tell us who took the money or it’s a one-way ticket to the bouncy house.
Chuckles here is just getting started. You don't wanna see what else he can twist that piece of rubber into.
Does Officer Butterscotch look like he's joking?
There are six more just like him coming out of a a Mini Cooper
Ok, looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way.
Don't make me take out my pin.
Look here, punk, you're dealing with New York's Funniest!"
If you think I’m tough, wait until you have to deal with the clown behind me.
You have the right to remain squeaky.
OK son, just tell Captain Crusty where you stashed his scooter and happy pants, or you and your little friend will be finding out that life is no circus
We can do this the easy way, or the weepy-peepy-creepy way.
You know what's scary? I'm the good cop.
For the thousandth time, didn't you ingest hallucinogens today?
No, I'm good cop.
Something funny here? We're not laughing.
You have the right to pantomime.
Actually, I'm the bad cop. He's the Krazy Kop.
Things will go easier for you...if you book him two weeks in advance.
You might think otherwise pal, but we're not playing games here.
Tell us what you saw or the dog gets it.
Don't think for a minute, kid, that you know which of us is the bad cop.
Confess or the dog goes pop.
He minored in theater at the police academy.
You can talk to me or you can talk to Detective Bozo. And believe me, you don't wanna clown around with him.
Really...so you have no idea what this is?
I'll put it this way, pal - I'm the good cop.
You have the right to a balloon dog. If you cannot afford a balloon dog, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you?
Oh, so is this whole thing a joke to you?
Look, we can do this good clown/bad clown thing all day, or you can tell us who stole the elephant.
Funny ha or funny haha?
Don't think for a second that I won't pop it.
Detective Bozo, and his partner K-9 are not buying your story either.
Start talking jimmy, or chuckles takes over
We get answers....or no balloon.
Wipe that grin off your face, buddy, this is no laughing matter.
Okay, so we agreed to your demand. Now, tell us where you buried the body.
The agency was out of good cops.
I can help you, son. Captain Krusty from our K9 Unit, won't be so nice!
What do you thing we are around here - a bunch of clowns!?
You have a right to remain silent. He's made a career of it.
Stop laughing, punk. Do you see anything funny about this?
We can't afford a sketch artist right now.
This part of our improved customer experience program. Once I have charged you with first degree murder, he will cheer you up.
We can do this the fun way or the boring way
Don't laugh - he minored in Criminal Justice at Clown College.
Are you saying my partner fabricated the evidence?
No......actually I'm the bad cop.
If he doesn't make you talk, then I'll send in the mime.
My partner doesn't look tough but that balloon dog used to be a German Shepherd.
I don’t think you’re taking me seriously...
Want to play rough, do you? Well, Bozo's just getting started -- and those are EXTRA squeaky balloons.
Don't make us pop another one!
Do you take us for clowns?
You do have the right to remain silent - but my partner Barry here could really use some consctructive criticism.
My partner here is not going to be as straight with you. He's kind of funny like that.
Confess, or it's the bouncy castle for you.
Hey, listen! I'm not clowning around here!
Don't make me call in the bad clown!
He's part of our diversity program.
You really expect me to believe my partner planted the evidence?
Listen. I don't know what you slipped in Officer Wilson's drink, but I need answers.
That's Detective Bozo to you kid.
A word to the wise, we have a mime practicing in the next room.
If you don't cooperate, we'll kill the dog.
Waddaya mean you'd rather work with a sketch artist?
And wrap your head around this: I'm the good cop.
What do you think this is, a birthday party?
If you can't tell... I'm the bad cop.
So, who’s laughing now!
Confess now or Bozo pops the pooch.
You're good...real good, but my partner Tim here is great at getting to the bottom of any funny business.
Now talk, or we’ll break out the seltzer.
So you think you're funny, huh?
Budget cuts -- we had to restructure the K-9 unit.
Good cop or bad clown. Your choice.
Won't talk, eh? Maybe three hours of watching someone in a fright wig making balloon animals will loosen your tongue!
And there are 20 more of them waiting in the Volkswagen outside.
Now talk! Otherwise, Officer Binky puts your dog to sleep
Ready to talk, kid? Or should Po-Po here twist up wiener dog #613?
That will be all, Sgt. Blinky. I am through clowning around with this guy.
Lets take it from the top, so you, a dog and a clown were at the birthday party and ...
Not gonna giggle and clap your hands together, eh? Well, we have ways of making people giggle and clap their hands together.
Listen balloon man, Officer McDonald is holding your breathalyzer evidence in his hand.
OK! We're done clowning around.
Well, how's it going to be, punk? Good cop, bad clown or bad cop, good clown?
Your choice - you can talk now, or I'll leave you alone with Detective McTwisty.
You have the right to laugh silently.
I'm fine playing Good Cop, Bad Cop, but you really want me to be the bad cop...
So, you think this is funny, do you?
Frankly, your history as class clown makes you an ideal candidate for FBI leadership.
I know he's new on the job but just tell Bob what you saw and he'll try to make it.
Tell us what Putin knows, Zuckerberg, or the little dog gets popped!
You asked for a lawyer, so lucky you; you get Gary Cohen.
We're not clowning around. This puppy's gonna pop unless you talk.
And my partner here says that anything you mime can and will be held against you.
Not afraid of clowns, are you? We’ll see.
Tell us where the money is or the dog gets it!
Yeah, and I'm the good cop.
Listen kid, I'd hate to turn this interview over to Officer Friendly.
You won't be laughing when we call your mother.
If you think I'm twisting your words, just wait until you see what Detective Bozo does to you.
And what makes you think he plays the good cop.
Officer Donald prefers to lighten the mood before he begins "enhanced" interrogations.
This is Portnoy. He’s filling in for our sketch artist.
OK, we can do this the easy way or the scary clown way....
Officer Chuckles has ways of making you talk.
Do you really want me to send in the clowns?
It would be a shame if we accidentally left you alone with the police dog.
If you thought this was no laughing matter, then you were wrong.
Quit clowning around or we'll leave it to the man who really knows how to twist an arm...
Quit clowning around. I get enough of that from Lieutenant Bozo over there
He may look like the good cop, but he’ll twist you like that little balloon if you don’t start talking.
Listen, kid, you're better off talking to me. Once my partner gets done with you, he'll forever haunt your dreams.
Don't be fooled by the costume, I'm the nice guy.
The balloon animal already talked, so you might as well confess.
Perhaps THIS will refresh your recollection.
Our sketch artist took the day off and Chuckles is all we could get on such short notice. Is this what the dog that attacked you looks like?
Do you know what happens to suspects when Detective Dimples runs out of twister balloons?
Rumples will give you this balloon doggie if you just tell us who gave you the cocaine.
We are done clowning around
You ever hear of seltzerboarding?
You have the right to turn that frown upside down.
This interrogation is going nowhere..... Send in the clown!
Happy birthday, scumbag.
A wise guy eh? Joe here’ll break every funnybone in your body.
It's time we got serious, kid.
Do you recognize this dog?
Look, you can either call a lawyer or see the tiny tricycle act -- your choice.
Now it's a cute puppy, but if you don't start talkin' that can easily change.
I’m not clowning around, that comes next.
Tell us what you saw or the dog gets it.
“Let me assure you young man, this is no laughing matter”.
I'm the good cop -- so just imagine what he can do to you.-
Now you're in for it--Officer Bozo is a member of our 'Laugh 'till it hurts' unit.
“I’m James Comey and this is my Attorney General”.
My partner's been out there dealing with the media circus.
Start talking, or or you can kiss the cake and ice cream goodbye!
Did you swallow those drugs, son?
Your problem? I'm the good cop.
He's serious. Talk! Or, the dog gets it.
What do you mean that’s a funny question?
Isn’t it rich?
Do you think we’re clowning around here?
That's right. Good cop, scary cop.
On the other hand, a court-appointed attorney is always an option.
No, it is not your birthday today!
I should warn you, he has a needle and he's not afraid to use it.
Really? Well our canine unit says otherwise.
We've already got a funny guy.
Jerry went undercover for a while. He's never been the same.
Good cop and bad cop have left for the day. He’s a different kind of cop.
OK, no more Mister Nice Guy.
You think this is all fun and games? We’ll show you fun and games!
No I don't think it's funny that the monkey got drunk and fell on the elephant's trunk, and neither does he.
We're not clowning around here! Either confess or we let the air out of your dog.
That's where you're wrong, punk...I'm the good cop.
You think we're tough? Wait till the bearded lady shows up!
For him, punks like you are child's play...
There's only one class clown, got it?
yeah, we're going undercover. Should fit right in almost everywhere in DC.
You want to clown around? Fine, two can play that game.
I'm the "good cop".
Wrong! I'm the good cop.
You think we're clowning around?
And I'm the good cop!
Consider yourself lucky, kid. Detective Bozo left the big shoes at home.
Sam's a clown; you're an idiot. Big difference.
Give it a rest, Phil. We're just not getting through to this guy.
He's detective Ringling. No, I'm not his brother.
Talk or the puppy gets it!
Quit being a bozo.
Budget cuts, kid. We’re BOTH bad cops. Talk.
I know what you're thinking, you're thinking good cop bad cop and I'm the bad cop but you're wrong you're so wrong
Depending on your phobias, we might both be bad cop.
Do you think this man is joking?
No, buddy, I’m the good cop. You are really in for it!
Ok Bob, we can do this two ways, but you won't like Bozo's way!
Don't make him take out the seltzer bottle.
He is not just ANY clown. He's a Millennial Stress Reducing Interrogation Professional.
Just who do you think the courts will believe?! You, or Detective Bozo?
It's a balloon-dog eat balloon-dog world out there, kid.
You seriously want to talk to that clown?
You don't like the squeaky noise when he makes a balloon animal? Then talk.
In the criminal justice system, Clown based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Silly Victims Unit.
Bad news for you, I'm the good cop.
Clown? We haven't even begun to Clown.
Try again Mike. The kid says it still doesn't ring a bell.
Where were you on the day of Steven's birthday party?
So you think I'm the bad cop, huh?
Who’s laughing now?
Don't be afraid. This is the president of the United States.
I don’t know why you think this is some kind of game!
Talk quick or in one minute 11 of his friends are coming in here in a VW Bug
Either tell me the truth or I'll turn you over to some Bozo who will make your life a living hell
This isn’t funny!
Punk. You think we're just clowning around here?
… and time served on Balloon Island will morph you into a balloon animal.
Who's the clown now, punk!
Who's the funny guy now?
Ok, now I really want my lawyer.
We can make balloon animals all day, buddy.
If you don't squeal, he'll make it squeak.
Doug, you think this is funny? My partner will show you funny!!
We call this phase of the interrogation: good cop; childhood nightmare cop.
We actually are here for fun and games. What’d you think?
No, your wrong, I'M the Good cop!
You think you're funny? Let me assure you, you don't want to see funny.
We have ways of making you talk!
Take this seriously. We're not clowning around!
Unlucky for you, I am NOT the "bad cop".
No, YOU stop clowning around!
Guess what? I'm the good cop.
So you think I'm the bad cop, huh?
Listen Buddy! Your not taking your situation very seriously.
Start talking or you’ll have to answer to this clown.
This is a little thing we call good cop, sad cop.
I don't think you appreciate the seriousness of the situation you are in!
You know, he can also make an electric chair.
See my partner there?? Well, that's Detective Bozo...and he doesn't just do that trick with balloons. So start talking, buddy...
Look, I believe you. But my partner here, well, he thinks there's something about your story that seems a little funny.
If you tell me one more time that Sergeant James is dressing like a clown and pulling out a balloon dog whenever I turn my back, I’m going to lock you up for a month in solitary confinement
You have the right to become terrified.
Okay, so the perp doesn't look like a dachshund. Sam, do the teddybear, and maybe this guy's tongue will loosen up.
Don't smile, it only encourages him.
You think you're funny, huh.
He just won't crack... Johnson, make the giraffe!
I’ll only confess if he makes a giraffe.
You better talk, or the dog gets it.
OK, here's the deal: We can do this the easy way or the very creepy way.
If you thought water boarding was excruciating ...
That's it, scumbag...we're sending in the clowns
...so you better come clean, see? You don't want me telling my partner here it's your birthday.
I can assure you that Detective Bozo has heard all the jokes about his name before, so don't bother!
What do you think, we're just clowning around here?
Look, I have all night and he can make 678 figures so whenever you are ready to talk go ahead.
We can play good cop or insufferable cop.
Don't make us play good clown bad clown.
All right, no more clowning around... No, not you, Larry.
Ok, our sketch artist is sick today, so Officer Chuckles is stepping in for him...
Don't make us send in the clowns.
For the last time, the balloon is the truth, the dog is your twisted lies, and the clown is ...well, he just likes dressing up.
You don't want to be left alone in this room with my partner!
Joe, give this young man a little clue about life inside the pen.
If you don't confess to me you'll have to talk to Sergeant Bozo, and if that doesn't work there are eight more just like him in the tiny car outside.
The first thing for you to know, I am the good cop.
Can't you see it makes Inspector Hector sad when you demand a lawyer?
I've seen clowns like you before
What more can you tell us about the Bozos who were with you?
Something funny, punk?
No attorney - you get a doggie. And, if you cooperate, maybe cake.
Look pal - do you really want to be left alone with that clown?
Oh he can make a lot of things: dogs, parrots... the murder weapon.
Ironically, when he dresses like that, he's not clowning around.
The toy is yours if you confess
“This is serious son, no more clowning around”.
Here's how it is: we can do this the hard way, or we can do this the punchinello way.
NOW do you remember seeing anything funny that night?
Now that my partner is here, would you like to amend your testimony characterizing this investigation as a circus?
In this city its Good Cop - Scary Cop.
Okay tough guy, we’re gonna stop clowning around.
We can do this the easy way, or the painfully ironic way.
Do we look like a couple of clowns to you?
Listen up, buddy! I happened to be the good cop.
No more Mister Nice Guy. You squeal, or I send in the clown.
My partner can be very....entertaining.
This the best we can do with the new Witness Protection budget!
Do I look like I’m joking?
Talk! Or we'll bring in the accordion player.
“Quit calling my partner a ‘Bozo’ and answer my question!
If you confess he will make an elephant for you.
We're done clowning around here...
Guess which one of us is the ‘bad’ cop?
Don’t mess with me kid. If I leave, he’s your worst nightmare.
If you don’t confess we’ll...” “They’re already here.
Look around, I'm the only friend you've got.
If you don't talk we can do good cop bad clown all night.
We can do this the easy way, or the disturbing feels-like-you're-in-a-David Lynch-movie way.
“Listen,doofus—I’ll give you one more chance to come clean—otherwise I’ll have to turn you over to Sgt. Bozo here—and what you saw him do to that balloon is nothing compared to what he’s got in store for you!
I said we need to make him crack, not crack up.
Don't let his appearance entertain you.
Perhaps this will refresh your memory
Or we can do it Bofo’s way.
Just don't make me call in the accordion player!
Either you cooperate, or we pop the dog.
Our sketch artist is off on vacation.
You’re not scared of clowns? You’re going to be.
You can’t lie to Mr. Jingles.
Listen Son, there’s only one Bozo in this room and it’s not me.
That's right, it's a balloon doggie and a clown wig with your name inside it. Now do you want to tell us how they got inside Michael Cohen's safe deposit box?
We can do this the hard way or the hilarious way
I'm getting Weary Willy. We can do this with or without a pie.
Is this your dog?
Tell us what we need to know, or the dog gets it!
Watson here thinks it’s very curious that the dog didn’t bark that night.
You think this is funny, don’t you?
You thought this was funny?
I think the clowning around is pretty much over.
A state mandate has forced some changes to our good cop, bad cop dynamic.
...And he’s available for parole hearings.
Oh trust me, we have ways of making you talk.
If you don't want to talk, Officer Balloony will take you for a little ride in his very tiny squad car along with 12 of his fellow officers.
Guess who is the 'bad one'!
What do you mean when you say you are a cat person?
Yeah, well I'm the good clown.
He's a rescue
Ted here can make balloon animals all day. So start talking.
This is where we find out if you’ve got any sharp objects on you.
Look kid, we’ve been in this room since you were 5 years old, tell us who did it and we can all go home.
Trust me, you won't like him when he's frowny.
Bad news for you is - I'm the good cop.
Spill your guts now or I'll leave you alone with Officer Chuckles!
Start talkin', or you're headed to the Big Top.
Show me where he touched you.
Give it up, kid. There are twenty-six more of us in the squad car.
You think this is funny? Honkers, get the squirt flower.
I've got news for you. We are not clowning around here!
Not so funny now, is it?
Do you think this interview is some kind of joke, punk?
Let's see if the K-9 unit can make you talk.
Don’t look at him. I’m the good cop.
Bad cop? You wish!
We're done clowning around with you!
Ohh, so you won't sing, eh? Well let's see if we can make you laugh.
Good cop has been phased out. Now, only bad cop and psychiatric cop
'' Mr. Zuckerberg, We are here to help you."
You're not gonna' like Detective "Jingles" interrogation methods.
Don't let Detective Johnson fool you. He's the bad cop.
We have your fingerprints on the ballon dog.
And neither of us is the good cop.
Confess to me or Jacko the Clown will apply the balloon squeak technique.
As you can tell, my partner has taken this good cop bad cop routine to a whole new level.
NOW you are telling me you are NOT Stephen Sondheim!?!?”
Talk! You don't want Mr. Wiffles to ask the questions.
These charges are very serious.
If you think I am tough, just wait until Bozo from our K-9 unit is done with you
You think you're funny, wise guy? You don't know funny.
One more wisecrack out of you and I'll send my partner out for the seltzer bottle.
You're not going to like how he does a cavity search.
Son, this is serious. Or do you think we are just clowning around?
Wrong...try good cop, disturbing cop.
I can assure you that impersonating Jeff Koons is no laughing matter.
You can have Mr Nasty, or Mr Nice. Think vee..ry carefully.
Don’t make me bring in the Ringmaster.
I got news for ya kid. Happy the Clown he ain't.
Show us where he touched you . . .
Talk. Or we’ll bring in the mime.
Trust me, no will ever notice that you're in the Witness Protection Program.
You think we're a bunch of Bozos here. Well, you'll soon find out otherwise!
You can talk to me, or you can talk to this bozo.
Maybe you’ll have more to say in a high pitched, squeaky voice.
Last time I brought you in you thought it was funny....now it is.
We have ways of making you talk funny.
You won't like us when we get silly.
Well yes, new laws have made us change our interrogation strategies.
He can do this all day.
We take our job very seriously
Any comment before Sargeant Sparkles reveals the results of your breathalyzer test?
You think I’m scary?
No ! ... I'm the funny one.
Well if this doesn't refresh your recollection, you had a lousy childhood.
It's actually bad cop, sad cop this time.
Just answer the question: was he or was he not believable in his undercover role?
Your Facebook account says your afraid of clowns.
He's missing his daughter's birthday party. Quit clownin' around.
I'm going to ask just once more...now where did you stash the LSD?
I get the good cop/bad cop but what if I'm afraid of clowns?
Either you work with me and Sgt. Bozo, or I call in the mime and the bear on a unicycle.
We don't have any lawyers available right now but how about a giraffe?
Honestly, we're both surprised you didn't see this coming.
Officer Chuckles here is going to make you laugh until you spill your guts
Nope. I’m the good cop.
Tell us what you know fella, or we bring in Bad Clown!
All right, we got you an interpreter. Start honking.
So you’re telling me that your dog, Mr. Ruffers, looks nothing like this balloon replica, which was forensically compiled from the witness statement by our top balloon-animalologist? Well I beg to differ.
Yes, he is the bad cop.
Sitting through his act makes waterboarding seem like a walk in the park.
Okay, start talking or Officer Muldoon will make even scarier balloon animals.
So you think you're a tough guy, huh. We'll see how many kiddie parties you can sit through with Mr. Bozo here before you talk.
It’s DETECTIVE Bozo now
Talk or the clown's dog gets it.
Okay, Larry looks like we'll have to play good cop, creepy cop. You're up.
Now ya' gottta answer to Bad Clown, and Bad Clown don't play around.
You think we don't know what you did? We're not a couple of clowns!
Detective Bozo knows all sorts of tricks to make you talk...
You think this is funny? I'll show you funny.
Does he look like a clown to you?
What makes you think I'm "bad cop" in this scenario?
Meet my partner. He'll make you fold under questioning and maybe you'll eventually pop. Will there be children crying? Yes, I like to imagine there will be children crying in extraordinary quantities.
I'm gettin' too old for this skit.
Listen up, punk! If you think Officer Gacy is the "good cop" and I'm the "bad," then you're in for a nasty surprise.
Either you start cooperating with my partner here, or I bring in Detective Tickle Monster.
You think this is supposed to be funny?!
See, punk. We can play rough, too.
I could turn you over to Binky, and you don't want me to turn you over to Binky!
This routine is getting old.
Don't let the props fool you. He's the bad cop.
We can make this hard or we can make this silly.
That's old school! Now we do bad cop, REALLY bad clown!
No you can't play with it! It's his K-9 partner.
Facebook tells us you'll spill your guts to Mr Zippo here
Facebook let us in on your little phobia, so it’s time to start talkin’ or we bring in the clown...
If you don't start talking soon, there's a whole circus waiting for you outside that door.
You've Seen THIS routine before?
We've found court's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment focuses more on the former than the latter.
Good cop, Carrot Top.
Ready to spill it now, or do we have to bring in the mime?
Ok funny man. You think you're funny. You ain't seen nothin yet.
Still think this is funny?
Of course he's grumpy! His patrol car holds 20 other cops!
"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and probably will be used in Detective Schwartz's next appearance on Sesame Street.
This interrogation is nothing, compared to the hours of torture that listening to the squeaking sounds of balloon animals being made will be.
Where were you when the circus left town?
This is a serious matter, Larry.
You can come clean now or I can leave you with him for an hour.
Tell us who did it, my partner's done playing around.
Clown Scene Investigation. Of course that's what CSI stands for.
Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room!
We can do this the sad way or the funny way. Your choice
No, it's a horsie. Only a sick, criminal mind like yours could say it's a doggie.
After his deep cover sting brought down Ringling Brothers, Jones was still having a hard time readjusting.
I don’t know how much more of this YOU can take, son, but I’m pretty close to MY limit.
Don't make him use the seltzer bottle.
It's time to come clean. Squeaky clean.
Let me tell you about a nice balloon that didn’t cooperate.
You don't want to know what happens when Officer Binky runs out of balloons.
We have ways of dealing with twisted individuals like yourself.
Do we look like we're clowning around?
CONFESS....or we'll send in the clown !
Unless you talk, this will be the weirdest experience of your life.
You think playing hooky from clown school is funny?
That's right punk, we are taking good cop, bad cop, to a whole different level.
Have you seen this dog?
As you can see, our K9 unit has undergone significant budget cuts, so I'm going to ask you one more time: where did you stash the drugs?
There’s only one place you could have learned to make a dog like that.
We can do this the hard way, or we can do this silly way.
Pay no attention to him, he's the class clown.
Yeah...Bad cop is on administrative leave.
Believe me, it's not pretty when he runs out of balloons.
Is this the dog that bit you?
Does THAT jog your memory?
If you won’t tell me right now who did it I’ll get some bozo in here to make you tell me!
Good cop, Wacko cop
Cooperate and you get the doggy. Otherwise, Officer Bob comes back with a pie.
Admit it! It's a dog!
Don’t make me bring in the seltzer bottle.
Oh, you think this is funny? That’s a drug sniffing balloon animal dog.
Get this through your head. We’re going light on you now but there’s a mime coming.
Look at him. Look at Carl! Is that what you want for your life? Is it?! He’s a clown, Stuart. He’s a clown.
I’m bad cop..... unless you’re afraid of clowns that is.
I know it might be confusing, but I'm actually the 'good cop' in this situation...
Don’t get funny with me boy, that’s Gary’s job.
Wipe that smile off your face!
Fine Bill. We can try the good cop/sad cop routine.
Did you, or didn't you, pin the tail on the donkey?
Aren't we a pair?
OK -- one more chance. Then he does his Liza Minnelli.
He wants to know how you got twisted up in something like this.
Now listen here, Buster, you've made a circus of this town for long enough!
Don’t look him in the eye. Let’s just slowly make our way towards the door...
You need to understand, son. I am the good cop.
It's on his bucket list, okay?
Good cop, bad cop...guess who’s who!
If I was in as much trouble as you, bud, I wouldn’t be laughing.
I’m the good cop. You can guess what Officer Bozo is.
For the last time, how many other dogs have you blown up?
Think what you will, but I'm the good cop in this scenario.
Talk or the dog gets it.
You can either deal with me or this clown!
The charges against you are ballooning
You're right, we are playing good cop, bad cop.
Fess up, or your future is sucking helium like this clown.
We practically invented good cop, bad clown.
Spill the beans buster, or I'll bring in the mime
Just so we're clear, I'm the good cop.
Look, we've all got somewhere we want to be, so let's make this quick
Don't make him get his squirt flower.
You had a chance to tell me your version; now, you'll have to deal with this clown!
Look son, you either confess or you get to spend an endless night with Uncle Chuckles.
If you think my partner is a clown, wait until you see the circus we have in county lock-up.
Listen punk, do we look like we're clowning around here?!
Who you callin' a clown?
He has a few tricks up his sleeve to make you talk...and a very impressive unrelated trick in which he produces a bewildering number of handkerchiefs from his mouth.
If you confess right now, we'll throw in a balloon.
Did you just call him a bozo?
Dammit we don't have a sketch artist! This is the best we can do!
The sooner you confess, the quicker we can all have cake and ice cream.
Ok! We can do this the easy way or the Pennyway!
The sketch artist was busy.
You have a right to refuse cotton candy but anything you say will be made into a balloon.
Cooperate, kid, and we’ll get you community service ...and a giraffe.
OK, we're finished clowning around here!
Detective Jones couldn't help but notice that Detective Tobin's personal life had begun to affect his job performance.
Look, it's bring your millennial-son-to-work day.
Ya better come clean with me kid. Or you'll be talkin ta this bozo.
Keep lying, buddy. Your partner has already laughed at everything.
No, he is not the president. He is just another clown to entertain the inmates
Officer giggles is part of an outreach program.
“We’ll stop clowning around when you start giving us the truth!”.
Okay, you're taking the "good cop" thing way too far.
I hate working with these clowns. That's D.C. for ya.
Look kid, I know you think we're clownin' around here, but, this is no laughing matter!
Free animal balloon with plea bargain!
Don't be fooled. He's our bad cop.
I told you, this was gonna be a circus.
Maybe my partner buys your story, but do you really expect me to believe you had 22 people in your little car?!?
Trust me, he can do that to you if you don't talk.
'Wait 'till the bad cop shows up."
Did you honestly just ask for a Happy Meal?
You might as well confess, we have been following you for 10 birthday parties.
Alright tough guy . .. you got your Clown and Doggie.. NOW TALK !
Confess now or karaoke comes next!
Well, Birthday Boy? Ever hear of the leash law?
As a condition to your plea agreement, you consented to teach him more than one balloon animal.
The bad news is, I'm the good cop.
Officer Chuckles has ways of making you talk.
Tell us, or he releases the hound.
Mr. Yorke, this is concerning your behavior at your eighth birthday party.
Listen, BUDDY. We're working with Facebook data to use your deepest fears and insecurities against you. So you'd better tell us everything we need to know, NOW!
You think this is twisted, buddy? Wait till you see what Jenkins can do with a balloon.
You didn't expect good cop and clown cop did you?
...And my partner here had to come in on his day off you little scumbag....
Your latex allergy is the least of your problems.
Everybody knew “bad cop—good cop,” so we thought we’d try a variation.
His technique may be unconventional, but he's the best sketch artist in the city.
Choice is yours, full confession or the music will commence and my partner will run the interview from here
You can talk to me or you can talk to the clown...what's it gonna be?
You think I'm the bad cop? Wait 'til this clown gets you alone in a room!
Confess now or the show will begin.
I’m through clowning around. That’s my partner’s job.
He’s Stephen King’s worst nightmare, and soon he will be yours.
Something funny, funny guy?
Yes, he’ll make you a giraffe!
You think this is a joke?
“I wouldn’t laugh if I were you”.
You think we’re just clowning around, Bub?
No, Son--I'M the "good cop."
Eyes over here, big guy.
Hey! I'm the one who asks the questions.
You perps never get wise to our undercover K-9 unit until it's too late.
Believe me, you'd rather confess than hear his life story.
Look punk. Captain Snuggles here has methods to make you talk.
That’s right, I’m the good cop and he’s the bad joke cop.
You may think we are a bunch of bozos...
You won't even know which one of us is the bad cop until it's too late.
Okay, tough guy. Since you won't laugh at my jokes, I've called in a Pro.
Don't mess with Sgt. Bozo; he has a pin, and he's not afraid to use it!
You had your chance. We are done clowning around.
Start talking or he'll make another one and start rubbing them together.
Talk or he'll put on the floppy shoes too!
OK, you got your balloon animal. Now where you last Tuesday?
He can come back with his selzter bottle.
Look at me while I’m talking to you!
That's Detective Bozo to you, punk!
So you want to do this the hard way?
You can talk to me or you can talk to a guy who makes balloons squeal.
He pops the dog and then gets real crazy.
Do you think we’re fooling around in here?
No, I'm the good cop. HE'S the bad cop.
What makes you think *I'm* playing the bad cop?
You know, he makes handcuffs too.
Describe the shape of the assailant to our balloon artist Sargent Droopy, and then mark on the features.
I'm giving you one last chance before we resort to "good cop, bad clown."
Spill the beans or else we pop the dog and laugh about it.
Yes.....we are playing Good Cop-Creepy, Disturbing Horror-film Evoking Cop.
You gonna tell me what happened? Or should I let my evidence expert do it for you?
You better talk with me - my pal hasn't got much sense of humor.
It will go easy on you if you talk to Sergeant Clown; otherwise we'll have to bring in Lieutenant Mime.
Ok, kid, spill it, or I'll bring in the clowns.
Nope. I’m the good cop.
We brought in our composite sketch artist to work with you.
Yeah, my partner's a Bozo! So what?
If you're thinking I'm the good cop, you've got a lot to learn about balloon animals.
Either you answer the questions, or I'm leaving the room.
Look, he'll make you the monkey after you sign the confession.
Believe me, I'm the good guy.
We've found 'good cop, bad clown' to be much more effective.
Tell us the truth or the dog get's it!
Don't make me send Sgt. Kelowitz for the Seltzer Bottle.......
Good Cop is on vacation. This is Chuckles the Cop.
Meet Bad-Cop the Clown...
Are you going to talk, or are we going to have to twist it our of you?
Good cop/bad cop? You've been watching too many movies, kid.
Yeah? Well, I am [ital.] the good cop.
So...you won't talk! Well, I'll be turning you over to Sargent Squeaky and his VERY persuasive partner, Ruffles.
You think this is funny, huh? Let me tell you, son, I'm the GOOD cop.
You can hold the doggy when you start talking.
Perhaps this will refresh your memory, Mr. Koons.
Time to come clean, kid . . . unless you want him to squeak that balloon again!
No, I am the good cop.
Answer the question and you can have the doggie
Confess and you get to keep the balloon dog.
He's extremely effective on bozos like you.
Miranda? We ain't got no freakin' Carmen Miranda for you, you get Bozo and think yourself lucky
every day it's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right... i'm getting too old for this #$%^.
Cut the bullshit, guy- we know it was you. Even Chuck here can't tie a balloon animal like that!
Think very carefully now... He has quite a few tricks up his sleeve.
Blinky, he's not cooperating, bring in the helium...
That's right - I'm the good cop.
And if Lt. Bozo can't get you to talk we'll bring in Capt. Kangaroo.
You know what, Bobby, this kid thinks you're funny.
If you won't talk to us I've got 36 other partners crammed in my car outside.
Just answer the question and don't give us any funny business!
Listen punk, what kind of a clown do you take me for?
Don't be stupid! We don't do good-cop/bad-cop any more. You've been watching too many TV cop shows.
I’ve had it with your fun and games!
...and this is where the Farmingdale clown murder case takes a bizarre balloon twist....
Cooperate and we have a little gift for you.
We got ways to make you talk that Homeland Security didn't even think of yet.
Well... It’s the bad cop-silly cop routine then!
Believe me... you don't want my partner to use his very particular set of skills to make you talk."
And if my partner here can't make you talk, there's more where he came from - a whole tiny squad car full!
Dis you just call my partner a Bozo?
After 2 hours of his interrogation you'll realize I was the good cop.
I just paused the recorder, the next 5 minutes with Buggles is off the record.
Look at me! We’re not clowning around anymore.
Is this some kind of joke to you?
You say no one likes a rat, but what about a dog?
You’re wrong. This is actually known as “Good Cop. Big Top.”
The good cop, bad clown treatment hasn't even started yet.
Alright, this is the last time I'm going to ask nicely. What did you do with my partner's other balloon animal?
Tell me what I want to know or Ozzie here has some more knock knock jokes.
Don't force him to bring in the rubber chicken!
You think this is funny, punk? Good, because we've been practicing.
Keep stalling and Woofy gets the needle.
This only gets harder on you, son. Next step is the giraffe.
Tell us where the tiny bike is or Bozo here will make ya laugh 'til it hurts!
You’re wrong. Good cop/clown cop IS a thing!
Its our party and we can make you cry if we want to.
You think this is funny, young man?
Get ready for good clown, bad clown.
I can’t guarantee the safety of the balloon dog unless we get your full cooperation.
Wait'll you see the bad cop.
We’ve held up our end of the bargain, now spill it.
Oh yeh? You either talk or you spend the next 24 hours with this clown, and believe me that’s nothing to laugh about!
I can see him too, but he says he didn't tell you to kill anybody.
If you think this is his first rodeo you're sadly mistaken
A balloon phone book doesn't leave any bruises, does it Detective Chuckles?
Don't make him hide the handkerchief.
No kid, it’s bad cop - WORSE cop in THIS precinct!
So help me, Kevin, if I turn around and the dog's tail is only half inflated again. . .
The charges against me are inflated.
You may think I'm mean, but this guy can twist the truth out of anybody.
So you think you're Mr. Funny Man? I'll show you funny.
Fortunately for you, this is the Juvenile Division!
Or you can take your chances with my partner who'll twist it out of you.
Don't make us send in the clowns.
You think this funny, kid?
You think that's funny?
Don't force me to sen in the clown.
Good cop, weird cop...
You're in big trouble now, they've sent in the clowns!
No funny business!
Do you know what happens to those who twist the truth?
So you think I'm a clown, huh? I'll show you who's a clown!
You think I'm tough! You won't be laughing when my partner takes over the intreview.
Save yourself, dammit. Just pretend he's funny!
You think this is bad? Co-operate, or we bring in the mime.
He's back.
Who you callin' a clown?
Still think it's funny?
Talk first, then he'll make you and elephant.
You missed your balloon payment.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm the good cop.
Despite what this looks like, we don't want any funny business.
Not even a smile? You really are a hardened criminal.
And if you don't talk he is going to start to juggle! And then he will blow bubbles! You want that? Do you?
No, seriously, you think this is funny?
For your information Mister, the officer you refer to as "the Bozo behind me" is one of our best K-9 officers and he and his partner are going to make you sorry you were ever born.
If you're the good cop, then who the heck is that bozo?
Oh, so my partner here's a bozo, huh?
The regular sketch artist is off today!
Listen up buddy. We do not tolerate any funny business here.
You want the giraffe, confess.
Tell us what we wanna hear, and he'll make a hat for you
And now for the fun part...
Yes we've cutback the K-9 Unit, but now we do birthday parties.
What do you mean, "Which is the good clown and which is the bad clown?"
Did you, or did you not, laugh at his face?
No, I’m the good cop. He’s the annoying cop.
So you like to party, huh kid?
You get your animal balloon or one phone call -- you decide.
I'll ask you one last time, "Why aren't you smiling?"
Listen up, bozo.
Maybe Officer Buttons here has different methods, but we can both make you squeal.
Alright Mac, quit stalling. We know about the latex allergy.
You don't want to know why they call him Bozo.
Listen punk, your're not turning my investigation into a circus.
I bet you think we're ALL a bunch of Bozos.
What kind of sicko does that with a balloon?
Talk to me now, punk! Otherwise, Officer Gacy has ways of encouraging scum like you to cooperate.
It's time we play good cop, nightmare cop.
Blowing things up is no joke.
What you did is no laughing matter
I’m going to ask you one more time. Why so serious?
Well, you won't be laughing when he pulls out his seltzer bottle!
'… and believe me, he's a lot more scary than he looks.'
Okay. Son I want you to explain to officer Giggles here how you managed to fit twelve bodies in the trunk of your car.
Was it really worth seeing who’s on the other side of the glass?
Where's the pinata?
He might look like the good cop, but that used to be a Rottweiler
Your choice, Bobby. Talk to me and you’re outta’ here. Or - I go for a nice long lunch and you get to spend some quality time with Sgt. Billings and his friend Mr. Screetchy-Scritchy.
If the President can learn to make balloon animals, you can, too.
Book 'em Bozo
On no - I'm the funny one.
We can make this easy or we can make this a world of fun!
We used to do the whole good clown, bad clown routine, but let's face it, there's something creepy about all clowns.
After three hours with a mime, yeah, you'll talk.
Oh, you'll talk alright,when I leave you alone with this guy. He mimes the entire Bambi movie.
He's the chief's son-in-law.
We will give you the balloon dog AND fresh caramel corn if you tell us how you hacked our server
Yes, he is the bad cop.
And we've got your little dog too.
Am I the good cop, or the bad cop? That depends on how you feel about clowns.
Come clean or we pop the puppy.
Aha! He made you smile!
If you're not holding then why does our drug-sniffing dog find you so very interesting?
What do you take us for, a couple of bozos?
That's right, punk, its the ol' clown cop/bad cop and guess which one I am...
Since you are a juvenile, Officer Friendly will be advising you of your Miranda rights.
Confess - or the puppy dies.
Yeah he's a clown cop. He's a DAMN good clown cop
Any Bozo can see you’re lying.
I know you're afraid of clowns; that's why I'm the "Good Cop
Look, Billy. You can make this easy. Or you can make this har-dee-har-har-hard.”
His hair is the least of your worries.
Don't make us bring in the Mime!
Is this a closer to what you saw that night?
No, I'm the good cop. HE'S the bad cop.
Do you think crime is a laughing matter?
If you don't talk, I'm gonna bring in the mime.
So what do you say? More talking, or more squeaking?
I'm not gonna twist your arm, Jason. But Captain Blinky might.
Come clean or he’ll squirt you with seltzer.
Look, we can do this the easy way or Bozo's way.
..yes, water boarding is off the table, but need I say more?
And now, ‘Good Cop, Bad Clown’
Not so funny anymore, is it?
Don't you get it? I'm the good cop here!
My partner has ways to make you talk.
Believe me, the good cop is even worse...
Talk or the dog gets popped.
Believe me, Leroy, you don't want to deal with the clown.
Depending on how you feel about clowns, he can play either the good cop or the bad cop.
Tell us what you know, or that dog gets popped.
He's not clowning around, punk!
I’m getting a little agitated right now, so we’re gonna do this the engaging and whimsical way.
No, punk, I'm the good cop.
He wants to bring out your “inner child” so we can arrest what is left.
It's what he does with the balloon that makes him the bad cop.
We need to take a break. Detective Blinky is expressing the need to see a man about a horsie.
Zaza and Pokey have the best nose of any K-9 unit in the city. If they say you have drug residue on you, you have drug residue on you.
Why was this in your carry-on?
What you might find disturbing is that he's the bad cop.
OK, so he's an ex-White House staffer. But you better answer his question if you don't want to get deported.
Don't you hate casual fridays...?
Come on, kid. We can do it the easy way, or we can do it the ridiculous way.
I suppose you think we're clowns, Zuckerberg.
I've got bad news for you. I'm the GOOD cop.
Start talking or things get zany.
It's not torture. It's enhanced inflation techniques.
You like that? Of course you do. Everybody loves balloon-twist animals. Would you like to see the animals he makes with your arms and legs?
Joke's on you. We consulted our expert and it aint no dog...it's a horsie.
You better talk now because Giggles found your little toy at the crime scene, and he ain't laughing.
Spill the beans kid or your doggie is going to get popped
You shouldn’t have chosen your phobia as your bank’s security question
Okay, fella, you've had plenty of time to come clean. Time to send in the clowns.
Do you think I am clown?
Wrong answer, its a doggie.
If we twist your arm, believe me, you'll talk.
You may be looking at a long stretch.
If you don't start talking, he's going to twist that dog into shapes that will make your head spin.
There's only bad cop, scary clown cop.
Yes, you’ll get a goodie bag, too. Now, did you murder Mr. Miller?
Do we look like clowns to you?
That IS his partner.
Confess, or the balloon is history.
Or else what? Or else Mr. Funno will make squeaky balloon noises until you talk, that's what!
I'm not clowning around here, buster.
You think this is some kind of joke, bub?
First the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Then you get the balloon dog.
Budget cuts for the K9 unit
Thanks, your description of the dog in question has allowed my colleague detective Bubbles to nail the likeness.
Don't make me bring in The Three Stooges.
What's so funny?
All you need to know is I’m the “good” cop.
My partner is floating a trial balloon. I suggest you consider it.
we found your dog
What now? If this doesn't work, the dentist is gonna be next.
Anything look familiar so far? You say Baxter's tail was a little more waggly?
It’s good cop or squeaky, rubbing balloon sounds for the next 48 hours.
We all pop eventually.
Don't force me to sen in the clown.
Yea, I switched the condoms with his balloons, but I didn't know he was an undercover Cop.
You think this is a joke? We're not clowning around here!
You've been known to stretch the truth, so I brought in a specialist.
This is a bad cop/clown cop scenario and we'll have you squealing like that balloon in no time.
You think my partner is a clown?
Not funny? Yeah, well, you have 5 minutes to come up with a good caption or you are history around here.
Now we don't want to a media circus out there
Tell me now or the dog deflates!
Listen kid, you're better off dealing with me; that guy is a balloonatic.
...you have the right to honk his nose...
Listen, kid, I think YOUR the one blowing this all out of proportion; not Officer Hornhonker.
No good guys here, buddy: only bad guy, bad clown.
Looks like we’re gonna laugh here all night
Is something funny to you?!
Uh-oh, the three of us all think you're telling a little fib here.
Anything you say can be taken down and twisted into a balloon!
A guy in your spot would be makin a mistake to refuse a gift from Officer Bozo.
There’s nothing funny about my paranoid fear of clowns. Now, stop saying there’s one behind me.
Alright, son. Detective Punchinello has some enhanced interrogation techniques he'd like to demonstrate.
Keep it up and I will send sad clown home and bring in the angry clown.
If you keep this up, he'll be here all week.
You'll find out soon enough which one of us is the bad cop.
Trust me, you don’t want him to make another ballon animal
We have ways of making you wince.
The sketch artist didn’t make the budget, so we’ll need you to describe the suspect to my associate, Giggles.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the clown way.
If the clown doesn't get you to talk we'll bring in the accordion player.
We can twist more than your arm, buddy.
Actually, he’s the “bad cop.”
Tell us where you hid the cash, or the dog gets popped.
Y'know that horrible squeaking sound balloons make when you twist them into animal shapes, kid? Well, DO YA?? You're gonna be hearing a lot of that kid, unless you start talking, real fast.
Did the dog you lost look something like this?
Don't make him break out the seltzer bottle
The good cop / bad cop routine was becoming a bit of a circus.
You do NOT want to get on the bad side of the scary clown.
Big mistake, Billy. Bozo here is really Officer Bozio.
Don't be fooled, I'm the good guy.
Pay attention, Dr. Leary, we're not clowning around here!
You think this is funny, punk? We'll show you funny.
Yes, we're both the bad cop.
I'll ask you one last time--is this the dog that bit you?
What if I told you I was the good cop?
This is your last chance before we send in the clowns.
I suppose you think this is a circus?
If you want the little doggie balloon, you are going to have to answer some questions.
Do you take me for some kind of Bozo?
Believe me, you don't want us going all 'bad clown' on ya.
We're not clowning around here...yet.
Oh, you think you're funny do you? Yeah, of course you do. We all think we're pretty funny around here.
You have it backwards, I AM the good cop.
You don't want to see what he can do with those balloons...
You expect us to believe that Jeff Koons is involved?
That's what you think! He can twist you into a poodle.
Hey buddy. We're not all bozos on this bus.
Give me one more name, THEN you'll get your butterfly.
I’m detective Joe Smith, this is my partner, detective Harley Quinn; now wipe that smile off your face!
You think this is some kind of joke? I suggest you start taking this seriously and answer Detective Squeaky's question
This is serious! We are not clowning around!
These are serious charges, son. We're not just clowning around here.
I said, 'What do you want him to make next!?'
I really don't think you want to find out what Sgt. Beppo's interrogation technique is.
Oh, you'll talk alright. In fact, you'll be honking like a comical bulb horn.
Is this the dog that made your hair stand on end?
Start chirping or we send you to the Big Top.
Talk, or my partner will show you a different definition of 'balloon payment!'"
So what'll it be? Bad cop or totally frightening-you-to-death cop?
Just tell him it’s really good, then he’ll leave.
Look pal, if we could afford a regular sketch artist, Jenkins here wouldn't have to moonlight to make ends meet.
And if ya still don't talk, we're bringing in the mime cop!
Giggles, release the hounds!
Well, you asked for someone who would work pro-Bozo...
Ok - what’s it to be: good cop or ridiculous cop?
No smart ass, we ran out of the ‘bad’ cops!
Better talk now. You don’t want our mime in here.
Remain silent! We want a mimed confession.
I heard it's your birthday.
Don't smirk, you little punk -- I'm the good cop.
I don't like this good cop, funny cop routine. But we did find your condom at the crime scene.
Johnny, did this guy offer you candy?
Keep laughing, funny guy. Because in prison...You're the clown car.
The good cop is in another interview, so you get clown cop.
I suppose you think this is funny!
OK Jack, you wanna tell my partner here what you told me about how many of you were in the car?
Tell us where you were Saturday, or my partner pops your balloon.
We can do this allllllllll day long.
A 'happy meal'? Do I look happy to you?
If there's any clowning around to do, WE will do it.
That IS the good clown.
This isn't going to be entirely fun and games.
Listen, punk -- I'm not clowning around here! That's his job...
We can do this the hard way or the hilarious way
So you think this is funny? I'll give you something to laugh about!
Familiar with Stephen King? I'm the good cop.
Talk now--or we bring in the pony.
Hey punk meet our new Officer R. McDonald. Now tell us where the hamburgalur is.
Don't make me leave you in here with the clown.
People have been calling for a change in policing tactics, so I should of seen this coming.
I got news for you - I'm the good cop!
If you think he's funny, wait until you see the Judge.
We can do this the easy way or we can do this the psychotic way.
Tell me what I want to know or Sergeant Pickles will introduce Mr. Balloon Dog to Mr. Pointy Object.
Talk now, or my partner may just have a few tricks up his sleeve!
??Isn’t it rich? Are we a pair? I’m actually the good cop. You should be scared.??
This is serious.
You can talk to me or him. Just remember, I’m the good cop.
We've brought in the K-9 unit.
What's so funny, punk?
That's our final offer ! Take the balloon dog or five to ten upstate !
Unlucky for you, it's a bad cop crazy cop situation.
Our good cop is ill, you're stuck with bad and mad.
Ignore him. He's here for our diversity training.
You think this is funny? Because nobody else does.
Looks like my partner is going to have a little fun with you.
Cruel AND unusual
Now I know I said we weren’t doing the good cop bad cop routine, but my partner’s been practicing for weeks.
No more tricks. Either you come clean or the seltzer bottle comes out.
Just tell us where you hid the big red shoes or well throw sparky into the needle pile.
Listen pal, I'm the good cop.
'Fess up or your going to McJail.
That's right, it's a little doggie. Now tell us what we want to know or he'll make a giraffe next.
Waddya think we are, a couple of clowns?
We can switch to water-boarding, if you prefer.
Did you really think you could steal that little doggy in the window. And get away with it?
The funny thing is, I am the "good cop".
So disturbing the peace is fun for you? Well, meet Agent Bozo...a party animal’s worst nightmare.
"Really? This is what the guy looked like"?
Do you think that this is funny?
I didn't know they brought in clowns at every governmental level.
Words getting around you think we're a bunch of clowns here
Ok, Sport, Lie again and Detective Jingles Pops the Dog!
You have the right to remain silent - or to laugh and clap wildly at some of the best ballon tricks in the world.
Listen. We don't have time for any more shenanigans. Corporal Stevens is already late for his other job.
That's right, he's a terrifying mix of bad cop/sad cop.
We have ways of making you giggle.
Start talkin', or you get to be alone with him
We have ways of dealing with clowns like you.
Don’t make me bring in Bozo!
We have ways to make you talk.
Who's going to twist it out of you? Me or Mr. BoBo?
Laugh, punk! We have ways of making you laugh.
Alright punk, one more mister nice guy!
So your saying a clown with a gun, a badge, and a ballon dog set-you-up?
You leaked the clown's data Zuckerburg. Sad!
You want to explain what this was doing in your apartment?
You feel lucky, punk? Go ahead, ask him how many balloons he’s got left.
I said the suspect looked like the clown from IT not grumpy Ronald McDonald!
Don’t make my partner here bring in the car!
We can either do this the easy way or the Scary Clown way.
Okay. We can do this the easy way or the clown way. It's up to you.
Send in the clowns! Don't bother; they're here.
You think I was tough, huh? Wait to you getta load of this Bozo!
Trust me, you're better off talking to me than Officer John W. Gacy over there.
What do you take me for, some kind of clown?
Don’t toy with me kid, my partner knows how to twist you into shape!
Here at the EPA the Secretary has strict guideline for new hires.
The jig is up. The dog identified you in the line up
What do you think we are, a bunch of clowns?
I’m the nice one.
Don't be confused, punk. I'm the good cop and he's the bad cop.
This is what we call 'Bad Cop-Really Bad Clown'
We're through clowning around! Tell us what we want to know, or your dog gets it!
Which of you is the good cop?
Something funny, Scumbag?!
Never mind the wig; this is the balloon full of drugs we recovered from your digestive tract.
So you're saying the Hamburglar did it.
You think this is funny? No, seriously, any notes would be greatly appreciated.
He's a master arm-twister.
Look, it's no skin off my nose, but if you tell my partner here it's not your birthday...well, I can't be held responsible.
We take leash laws seriously in this town, mister.
Can you describe the suspect to detective Ronald?
Did You Notice Anything Odd About Him?
And after he turns you into a poodle, you get stuffed in a tiny cell with 75 others!
Oh you'll talk - or you'll have to watch my partners twelve hour act, which mostly involves crying and broken dreams.
So...are you saying the dog that bit you is more fluffy..is that what I'm hearing? Do you know how hard it is to make a fluffy balloon dog?
You won't be laughing when he's through with you.
I am the good cop, kid!
You want this to go the easy way or the magically enchanting way?
Hey, focus!
Does this refresh your recollection?
We found this balloon animal and 30 kilos of heroin behind your ear...
Welcome to our “scared straight” program.
And we have a tiny black and white filled with twenty more just like him on the way.
Okay, punk! The fun and games are over!
You think it’s funny, do you Jimmy?
I bet you're into some real twisted stuff.
The witness said today was your birthday.
We know how to handle clowns like you.
No! You get serious.
If you're twisting the facts, he'll know.
We call it good cop, really bad cop.
OK, kid. Start speaking, or there's more squeaking.
No, I'm playing the good cop. We were assuming you're afraid of clowns.
Wrong again, buddy — I'm the good cop.
You want to run away and join the circus? Officer Bozo is here to talk some sense into you.
Believe me. You don't want to see him do the hokey-pokey.
What do you mean, which one of us is Good Cop?
Find this amusing, do you?
He specializes in cases with surprise twists.
I know you signed up because you thought this would be easy. But Clown College is no joke.
We're bad cop and absolutely terrifying cop.
Confess and he'll perform at your next birthday party.
The old "goof cop bad cop" routine
Around here we use the 'Good cop. Clown cop' approach!
So you think this is funny, do you? I’ll show you something funny.
Balloon animals is not the only thing he twists.
Talk to me or prepare to be entertained. Your choice.
What made you think it would be a giraffe?
Flip and you get a happy meal!
He'll twist your arm and tickle you into telling the truth.
Lootenant Crusty here will wipe that smile off your face.
And if you think what he's done to that balloon is cruel and unusual...
This is no laughing matter, the Supreme Court is about to outlaw his next trick.
It's time to bring out the big puns.
Despite appearances, we're not clowning around.
Who are you calling a clown?
The new strategy of good cop, clown cop wasn't as effective as the department hoped.
If you don't start cooperating, I'll bring in the bad clown.
I'm gonna say this once. If you don't talk, and I turn you over to the lieutenant, you'll never sleep through the night again.
Just so you know...I'm the good cop.
See what Murphy did there? Now, imagine that, instead of a balloon ...
You have the right to remain silent...and good luck with that when I turn things over to Mr. Giggles!
There's nothing funny about animal cruelty, Mr. Peterson.
Ready to confess? We're getting tired of playing games.
...and if you don't, the mime is next.
I'd like to help you, son. But my partner here - he's kind of funny.
Good cop bad cop? Not so easy, is it?
Oh, you think I'M a clown . . . ?
You think I’m the good cop? Brace yourself!
No, not him. Me! I'm the good cop. You'll see.
In this case, kid, you should really choose the bad cop. Really.
I'm not clowning around. He is.
That’s Detective Clown for you buddy..
We do things differently around here. Meet Funny Cop.
This is your right hemisphere on drugs. This is your left hemisphere on drugs.
They wont' find that balloon for weeks.
So you think this is some kind of joke, huh!
I've got 49 more partners waiting in that closet - we can do this all night if we have to!
The balloon artist has come up with a rough draft.
Don't try to pin this on the dog.
Don’t make him get out the pins
You think he's scary? I got a mini-car with 20 more just like him anxious to interrogate you.
Sir, we’re transferring your case to the silly victims unit.
If you come clean, you'll get one of these.
"You still think our undercover man is funny?
Your lawyer's running late. Can I get you some peanuts or cotton candy while we wait?
The dog didn't bark. That's how we nailed you.
We're done clowning around Tommy... who stole the cotton candy?
Call us a bunch of clowns again. I dare you!
You may not believe this, but I'm the GOOD cop!
That attorney of yours is turning this into a circus.
The sketch artist is unavailable. We’re gonna need you to use your imagination.
Sorry for the cramped ride, kid. I hate taking Detective Bozo's car too.
We found this balloon animal in the glove box of your car. It contains 100 grams of cocaine. You mean to tell me this was planted?
So, you think you're pretty funny, huh, playing me with THAT alibi? Well, you AIN'T SEEN FUNNY YET!
So you wanted to pull some funny business, huh? We’ll show you some real funny business.
Does my partner amuse you?
Perhaps a little alone time with Sgt. McDonald might jog your memory.
We have ways of making you talk - or at least giggle.
Agent Ruffles here specializes in outlandish interrogation techniques.
If you don't want to spend another birthday in here, I suggest you start taking.
Next, we're gonna play a little game I like to call 'Good Cop, Bad Cop.'
We can do this the hard way, or we can do this the hilarious way.
Now start talkin', or the doggie gets it!
Ah, the old good cop clown cop routine
I'm gonna' make this real simple: You don't want to upset my partner here.
We don’t play “Good cop, bad cop” around here, do we Officer Sprinkles?
I don't think Good Cop, Funny Cop is working on this guy.
Is this your idea of a joke, turning Officer Clowney's balloon into a four-legged animal?
Guess which one of us plays bad cop.
We're not clowning around. Talk or we pop off the poodle.
Say it's a llama one more time.
For the last time, do you or don't you see a man standing behind me dressed as a clown?
I've brought in our sketch comedy artist to help us.
We’re mixing it up. Bad cop, bad clown.
Don't make it about him. This is about you.
He's doing the clown thing again, isn't he?
Diversity hiring is no joke!
He just came off undercover at a nine-year old's birthday party.
You say he looked like this. Would you recognize him again?
I know it is an odd tradition but it is your birthday and we are committed to the tenets of community policing regardless of the circumstances.
Believe me, Pal, you don't want to see the OCD cop....
Let me get this straight, you thought that dog was real?!
We can do this the easy way, or I can turn this over to Lieutenant Noodles.
You exercised your right to an attorney....here he is!
He's got nothin' to lose.
You better tell me. I don't think you're going to like Ronald's methods.
Tell us where he is or the dog gets it!
We resent your referring to Precinct 69 as a circus.
Wilkes may look funny, but get this: I'm the good cop.
Look, this clown has been impersonating an officer all over town and you're our only witness.
Still think I'm the bad cop?
Bring me the whoopee cushions.
You think we just a bunch of clowns around here?
I didn’t tie it. He didn’t tie it. So, you tell me…who tied the balloon!
Our composite artist is exploring new mediums.
Confess or we bring in the mime!
Don't kid yourself -- I'm the GOOD cop!
Do you think you have what it takes to be an undercover clown?
You're sayin' these charges are inflated?
Believe me, you don’t want him to break out the squeaky horn...
One more crack about budget cuts - and we'll put you in the lineup.
You do not want to see what comes after the balloon kitty.
Talk to me, or else this guy is gonna twist you into such a painful position, you won’t know whether you’re a dog or a rabbit.
Yeah, that’s right, smart guy. We DO have a large, female officer ready to sing.
Recognize him? Yeah, we twisted his arm a bit, but he told us everything.
Tell the truth or the doggy gets it.
You think it's all fun and games in here.
You have the right to remain silent and request a unicyclist who juggles.
Or maybe I let officer Gacy take you home.
I want you to look into my partner's eyes and tell him it wasn't you who totaled his squad car and hospitalized twelve of our finest.
He's the bad humor cop.
Justice doesn't stop for Red Nose Day.
So, we can do this the EASY way, or we can do this the FUNNY way...
You're not leaving until you talk or we run outta balloons.
you got a problem with "good cop, clown cop?"
You wouldn't want the nice doggy to go pop, would you?
You're in trouble now,here comes the bad cop.
I'm gonna ask you one more time, and then the clown's put you through the wringer.
You don't talk to me, you get to deal with the Bad Clown.
Do you wanna ride in the Clown Car?
Officer Smith here clocked your tricycle at ninety miles per hour.
When are you gonna wise up and stop acting like we're here to entertain you ?
Now tell us who did it, and leave the funny business to us!
Look at me! I'M the bad cop!
Your mistake was when you called me 'literally a twisted cop.' You meant 'figuratively,' now, didn't you?
Not now Officer Chuckles, this guy is about to break.
You blew it.
I'm sorry if the ride here in the squad car was a little cramped.
Now, we're gonna have to send in the clowns.
You think you see a clown cop sniffing a balloon dog. Tell us what else you see.
We’re not all clowns.
We'll see how tough you are when I leave you alone with Detective Sprinkles.
What makes you think this is the good cop, bad cop routine?
Send in the clowns....don’t bother they’re here.
You think we're fooling around?
Confess or we break your funny bone.
Good cop, bad cop? You wish. It's bad cop, bad clown around here.
See what 'Officer Twisty' made out of the last guy that wouldn't come clean?
Good cop, clown cop is how we interrogate little snots like you.
Since we got the body cams, he treats every arrest as an audition
Look, kid, you can talk to me or you can find out what the "C" in "NCIS" really stands for!
We can do this the easy way or we can do it the Twisty the Balloon Clown Cop Way
I suppose you think we're just clowning around here...
Who are you calling Bozo?
Don't make him put on the big green shoes.
Still nothing, huh? That's it--no more doing it by the book.
So you like to play games, huh!
How would you like it if I contorted your Weiner?!
If you don't give me that name, I'm gonna have to send in "The Joker"!
One more animal balloon, Officer Chuckles, and this time, let's make the twisty-squeaky sound really horrendous.
Look pal, I’m not clowning around here. He might be, but I’m not.
We can make this easy. Or we can make this fun.
Listen punk, we can do this the hard way....or the funny way.
Good cop-Bad cop is just something you see on TV, kid.
Ha! No, he's not the good cop.
Listen, son. Be careful what you wish for. I'm the good one.
Come on, admit you're guilty and my boss's balloon is your's
No, actually I’m the ‘good cop.’
Good cop/bad cop was getting stale.
We have ways of making you talk, mwahahahahabeepbeep.
Don't care for juvenile humor? Not a problem, we'll charge you as an adult.
You think that's bad? You should see what he looks like when he gets to be the "bad cop."
Your wrong!!! I am the good cop!!!!
We are not a bunch of clowns.
Stealing a police officer's balloon animal- you're looking at 20 years to life buddy.
There is no 'good cop'--Al here has replaced him, so you have to talk to me.
Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? Me here at last on the ground...
Is it is it not a real Jeff Koons?
'Your'e mistaken if you think I'm the bad cop.'
We're trying out something new: good cop, nightmare cop
who's that clown? well he's your worst nightmare
One more chance before you go to Crazy-Cop
Sorry. Our sketch artist is doing a birthday party.
Pennywise for your thoughts.
Son, you are in deep trouble. You see... I'm the GOOD cop.
Let’s get this straight, kid. I’m not answering your questions about Detective Miller here until you answer my questions about last night's robbery.
So you don’t think it’s funny, do you?
Better talk now, you don’t want to make him get funny!
Talk or Bozo punctures the dog.
Now... where are the drugs?
My partner here thinks your little story's a little twisted
Okay, I'm going to take a little walk, and then...well, let's just say you better like giraffes.
What's the big deal? Clowns are everywhere these days...circuses, White House, precincts....
You think I'm tough? Wait'll Detective Yucko has a go at ya.
You didn't think we could trace it to you; well we flew in an expert.
And where would we find this clown that did it?
You see, I'm actually the "good" cop.
Confess or it’s five hours of balloon animals; it’s your choice.
We can do this the easy way. Or we can do this the wacky way.
Our undercover clown already has you on two counts of using environmentally hazardous polymers and gas.
Enough Good Cop, Bad Cop. Talk! or Clown Cop is next.
Isn't the good cop/clown cop routine a little dated?
I'm tired of playing games with you.
Good cop or bad clown? It's your choice.
Start squealing or he starts squeaking.
He's about to put the dogs to you. Don't make him get his sword.
So, that's it! You really want this clown to take over.
Let’s see if Officer Chuckles can wipe that smirk off your face.
Tell me everything and Chuckles will leave your precious Fido alone
Yeah. That's right. We're done playing good cop bad cop.
Detective Giggles here will interrogate you now. He's been terrifying little boys for decades.
Listen kid, we're not clowning around here.
You think you're funny, do ya?
You think you’re a funny guy, huh? Well wait until you meet my partner...
My partner got him to squeal.
You can talk to us... or the mime!
Don't make me call in the lion tamer.
You better confess, because we're not clowning around! I mean, we're gonna stop now.
"Joke"? As long as you think this is a joke, I've invited Officer Gambino in to break your funny bone.
Yeah, well after you watch this guy for a couple of hours you'll realize that I am the good cop.
Start talking. We are *not* clowning around here.
Look, do me a favor. Just let him do his act and pretend you enjoy it. He’s worked hard on it.
Oh you think this is funny, do ya?
I'm getting too old for this shtick
Let’s not waste anymore time. My partner here has a birthday he has to get to.
So you think we're not serious?
I'm not clowning around here. He is but I'm not....
Our sketch artist has a cold, we are doing the best we can.
As you can tell, this isn't our first rodeo.
Answer, or he'll undo the dog.
You better start talking, pal. We’re looking at a whole different kind of bad cop here
What made you think you could outwit our senior clown expert?
This is what you can expect to be if you don't study in school.
Just to be clear, I'm the bad cop in this scenario.
So, which way is it gonna be?
If you think I’m scary, wait til you meet my partner.
Listen, we've already got too many of you clowns out there working under cover.
Is this the dingo w’ate your baby?
You want nice cop or clown cop?
One of us isn't taking this seriously!
I'm tired of this clowning around here. We've got jugglers and card tricks too!
This is Bozo, he’s the head of our canine unit.
Sergeant Slappy is going to show you what he'll do to your dog unless you give us the info.
The frightening thing is, I AM the good cop.
You think you're pretty funny, huh? Detective Stevens, here, is funny—you sir, are not!
Wait til he gets to screeching the latex balloons.
The shoes, kid, the big floppy shoes. I’m your last chance. Then it gets ugly.
My partner here is deep undercover.
You thought I was the bad cop? Think again, pal.
I fail to see how this is funny!
A classic "clown cop, bad cop" maneuver.
So now you have what you wanted; it is your turn to tell what you know!
Sorry that we've never found your lost dog, but we hope you'll take some comfort in Officer Felix's attempt in making your day a little brighter.
Son, don't make us play good clown, bad clown.
This is serious.
This is a little game we call Good Cop, Bad Clown
12 years undercover in clown college sure was worth it to take you down, sicko
You want to end up like this clown....
This is my partner, and he's gonna be your worst nightmare, Sparks.
Good cop, bad cop. Guess which I am.
No big shoes, no confession.
He won't crack. Not even a smile. Let's bring in the bearded lady.
Son, you think this a laughing matter?
Detective Bobo made the little doggie especially for you. Now say, "Thank you Detective Bobo" before you hurt his feelings, son!
What do you mean it was planted?
When you lie on your resume, but then get the job
You've got a choice, good cop or clown cop.
Did you or did you not resist arrest by officer Twisty?
This is a serious matter! Tell Mr. Giggles where you were on the night of the murder!
At least I know who the bad cop is...
Listen Kid. Work with me. Chuckles, here, ain't the kinda cop you want to play around with.
So, is this "IT?"
Give it up, kid - I can make your worst nightmare come true.
Talk or we go to bad cop clown cop.
Just to add pressure, we brought in Mr. Giggles...
If you don't cooperate, I'll have to leave you alone with Officer Bobo.
Forget good cop/bad cop. This is good cop/killer clown.
What do you mean "I'm funny?" I'm funny how, I mean, funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to amuse you? What do you mean funny, how am I funny?
Don't mind Jerry - he's only here because it's 'Bring the Black Sheep of Your Family To Work Day'.
That's right, Sergei. The President's been working undercover this whole time.
Stop clowning around, this isn’t a circus.
We're trying something different, good cop and crazy-as-a-loon cop.
We'll see who's laughing once my partner is through with you
Does he look like he's joking? Now does that look like the dog you saw or not?
Intimidated yet?
What's it gonna be, Kid -- the Big House or the Big Top?
Be straight with us--no funny business.
Relax, he's in charge of our witness protection program.
No, it stands for Clown Scene Investigation.
You wanna clown around? I'll show you clowning around!
Ok, wiseass. Now you get the bad cop.
Is this your dog, Larry?
The good cop is not here today, it's must me and this clown.
We can do this the easy way ... or the balloon animal way.
OK, you want to play games?
The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends into this fun skeaky poodle.
Doesn't matter, you still have to curb your dog.
Ever heard of 'good cop, worse cop'?
Believe it or not, punk, I'm the good cop in this room.
Good cop or bad clown. Your choice.
alright, son, now officer koons here is going to read you your rights.
See if you can guess who's the good cop!
My partner takes his good-cop role seriously.
... and I am the GOOD Cop ...
Here's our new composite artist, Blinky. Does this balloon look like your guy?
You want a lawyer or a doggie?
My partner might be a real Bozo, but he's a good cop!
You think we're fooling around?
Stop clowning around, he's the bad cop and I'm the good cop.
Are you the party we are looking for?
You don't wanna see his next trick!
You think this is funny, mister? I'll show you funny!
My partner has some pretty... unorthodox methods...
Do you see this poor balloon animal? It no longer has a mother due to your pin-happy antics.
You think this is funny pal? Well, my partner over here isn't laughing.
What makes you so sure he's the good cop?
Lt. Bozo has ways of making you talk.
My partner doesn't think what you did is funny.
So you think this is funny, do you, wise guy?
Not sure what you ran over, huh? Well, maybe this should jog your memory.
Listen, if anyone is going to clown around it'll be us.
ever wonder what happen to Timothy Leary
One last chance to fess up before I turn you over to Bozo.
No, he's not funny. Want to know what's really funny? Your alibi!
So you wanna talk to the bad cop?!
Does my colleague here remind you of anyone you are afraid of?
Talk or this dog becomes a snake.
Yes, we sometimes moonlight. Why the question?
Does this look like the dog that attacked you?
Listen clown. You’re no match for us.
I'm not clowning around here: my partner is."
Unlike officer Bonzo, I’m not clowning around.
Sorry fellow, but we cannot accept anyone in the FBI who can't make balloon animals.
So today we have a "goofy copy" instead of a "good cop." Deal with it.
To answer your question, this is the next step up from intern.
I’m done Clowning around. Start talking, or the poodle loses a leg.
No you can't choose waterboarding that would be illegal.
This isn't all fun and games, regardless of how it looks.
There's 117 more of him behind that door.
I think you’re twisted and full of hot air!
We couldn’t afford a sketch artist. Describe the mugger and Officer Fizbo here will work him up in balloon.
I suggest to cooperate; I am not as nice as Mr. Clowney!
Admit it - you kidnapped the dog at the circus - do I have to draw a picture?
I'm not talking to this clown
Hey punk, that's Sergeant McDonald to you!
Do you really want to find out which one's the bad cop?
Here's the thing buddy, Bozo's K9 unit can twist the truth out of anyone!
There's only room in this place for one clown, and it's not you!
I'm scary cop; my partner here is scarier cop.
Detective Gacy will be taking over the interview.
My new partner just finished the psychological profile on the perp … and that’s bad news for you, chump.
So, you're wise to the whole "Good Cop-Bad Cop" routine? Well, let's see how you deal with "Bad Cop-Scary Clown."
Time to bring out the dog, which you'll see is no laughing matter.
Tell us the truth, or we will tickle your funny bone!
Why do you keep laughing when I ask you who blew up this dog?
Talk and I'll have the clown make you a sword.
He can do dogs, fish, birds, and justice.
I'm not the "bad cop" - just more serious by comparison.
You are being charged with homicide and cruelty to balloon animals by deflation.
You want to clown around? My partner will show you clowning around!
Good-Cop, Clown-Cop; always more effective when they bring in the dogs.
I asked for my lawyer.
Trust me. I'm the good cop!
Wipe that smile off your face, punk.
It's your choice, pal. We can either do this the easy way or the 'Wobbity WOOP! Zing-smabbity-BAM! Mwah-HOOOOGA!’ way.
Officer Patches has ways of making you talk
So you're telling us there were 50 suspects packed into a tiny car?
...and NO funny business!
Wait till you meet the bad clown!
Alright kid, you're about to get a hefty dose of the good cop, bad cop routine.
Now that you've seen what my partner can do with a balloon, are you ready to talk?
Since federal law enforcement is now such a joke according to the President, they have adopted a new look and are now investigating adolescent humor.
We can do this the easy way or the clown way.
You think this is joke do you?
Yeah, it's good cop, balloon cop
Tell me where you hid the body, or Binky here will twist that dog into a flower!
I told you he wasn't kidding.
We can do this the easy way - or the Jangles way.
You can't even look me in the eye when you say you're innocent!
Whether I'm the good cop or the bad cop depends on you... and the extent of your coulrophibia.
So, you have no idea how Officer Squishy's dog made it into your apartment?
This is your last chance, kid. Talk to me or I’m leaving you with Officer Pagliacci.
I thought you said we were doing bad cop clown cop
My partner here won't put up with any funny business.
Alright buddy, we can do this two ways...
It’s only entrapment if you were invited to the party.
Laugh if you saw that dog on the night of May 7th.
Now you'll sweat. He's homeschooled.
...and if you tell us the truth you get to keep "IT"
There are 19 more just like him in a car outside!
Start talking or the dog gets it!
Yes, he's the good cop, but also funny crazy
Maybe a minute alone with Officer Pennywise will help jog your memory.
You WILL tell us the truth.....we have ways to make you talk. And Rocko here is an expert in dealing with Millennials!
There’s no clowning around in prison!
No; he's the good cop!
This is your last chance to talk, or I turn you over to the clown.
Just because it's Bring Your Adult Son to Work Day, that doesn't mean I have to be proud of him.
Talk ... or so help me, no more mister nice clown!!
“Ever hear of good cop, mad cop?
You need to know that I'm the good cop.
Listen kid, do you think this is just fun & games?
Now we're gonna play a little game I call Bad Cop, Idiot Cop.
You wanna guess which one of us is the good cop?!
Trust me, the next trick will be much worse.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a chortle of law.
How about we play a little good cop, gag cop?
You’re a former member of the Clown Crime Syndicate...we know they have a man on the inside, so just tell us who!
I don’t see what’s so funny.
Actually, he’s the “bad cop.”
Now that you've confessed, I'll send him out of the room.
Unless you tell us what you know, you're going to find out why this precinct is called the Fun House!
WE WERE UNDERCOVER!
Only a bunch of clowns would believe that story!
'Fess up now or I call in the mime.
This is serious business, son.
He's much more effective than water-boarding
Don't make me play Good Cop Bad Clown
Come clean or I'll leave you here with your worst nightmare.
Don't play the fool here! That's Jeremy's job, and he's got a family to support.
Looks like it's time for good cop, sad cop.
No! I'm the good clown.
Listen, kid, you don't want to get on Bozo's bad side.
Come clean, or the puppy gets it.
You take my partner for a bozo, kid?
Funny? Koons didnt think it was funny!
Now sing- and it better not be the aria from Pagliacci!
No, we're not Benson and Stabler. We're Barnum and Bailey.
I’m the good cop. I don’t think you want to mess with him!
He's here to twist you into a stool pigeon!
Budget cuts - no sketch artist. Well?
Fail to cooperate--and you'll look like that balloon animal...
And if you won't cooperate with Officer Chuckles, I have plenty of other partners waiting out in my cruiser.
We used to have a "Good Cop" and a "Bad Cop" but after the budget cuts this was all we could afford
My partner would like to ask you a few questions - and no funny business!
This is the FBI, Zuckerberg. You seem to think that we are clowning around.
My other partners are still in the car.
Admit it. You killed the balloon dog with a pin!
If you know what's good for you, you'll quit treating us like a couple of Bozos.
Yeah, that's right! He's bad cop
This case is still evolving.
Our sketch artist quit, so this will have to do.
Tell us what you know or Officer Bozo will pop the dog.
NO, It's Not President Trump! The First Family Does Not Have a Dog!
We have ways to make you squeak.
That's right, punk. If you don't start talking fast, I leave you alone with the Lieutenant until Monday.
well do you want the dog or not
You look at me when I'm talking to you!!
You'll crack up in no time now.
Jimmy, I’m trying to help you here. Tell me who did it before my partner seltzers you.
If you won't talk for him, we've got 57 more waiting in the car downstairs.
Just tell us who your exotic pet supplier is son, and we can make this all disappear.
I’m the good cop; he’s silly cop.
Dammit Johnson, Bad Cop! Not bad clown!
We don't actually think of it as a "Good cop/Bad cop-- it's more "Monologist Cop/Clown cop."
Do you have any idea why that balloon animal doesn't speak? It's a little hoarse!
You don't get a prize, kid...he's just a bozo.
Law & Order: Jester Victims Unit
You have the right not to laugh.......
We can help each other. You give me names, I'll give you this cool balloon.

Kid, where do you think my partner, Ronald, learned to make unbelievably lifelike balloon animals? Prison.
Quit your clowning kid - that's JoJo's job.
I'm stop. This is Frisk. Together we're known as - oh never mind.
Work with me or see the ballon dog get hurt.
The real orange clown was at Mar-a-Lago but this guy is a more than capable substitute
Listen, if I walk out that door balloon animals won’t be the only thing Bubbles will twist.
Now, I KNOW you don't want to see what else he can do with that balloon.
You should see the squad car...
and he bites too!
The sketch artist can't draw dogs but luckily Deputy Bonzo stepped up to the plate.
This is the old good cop, bad clown routine.
You'll have to forgive us – our sketch artist is at home sick today.
Rights!? What rights did you give that giraffe and that swan!?
Bad news, the kid talked.
Him? He's the comic relief.

You might not talk to me, but I bet you'll talk to BoboCop.
Don't ask.
The latest in police interrogation , Bad cop , clown cop.
Bobo's canine unit proved ineffective at intimidating the suspect
Ever since his father retired, Bobo has had big shoes to fill.
Man, I hope the cell is more spacious than that clown car cruiser.
-What do you mean “The real murderer is a clown cop” ? -...
Between you and me, I'm the bad cop, but he's much worse.
Listen wise guy, its a figure of speech that directly refers to one thing by mentioning another for rhetorical effect.
Ok, we are done clowning around here!
There's an 82.6% chance you have a fear of clowns. Are you sure you want me leave you alone with Donald or are you ready to confess?
We know the circus has a mole in our department -- why won't you tell Officer Chuckles and me who it is?
Good Cop, Clown Cop. Works every time...
I know what you asked for, but isn't this guy a lot more fun than some stuffy old lawyer?
Kenny had become disillusioned with his position at the K9 department.
Talk now or I’ll sic the good cop on you.
OKAY! No more clowning around.
They were out of ponies.
Damn it, Johnson. I told you that "Good cop, Hilarious cop" wouldn't work.
You don't want us to bring in the bad clown
All right. You know why we're in here. Now laugh.
And that's what Officer Puddles will do to you if you don't start talkin'.
Last chance to confess or it’s 100 Trump Tweets recited in the “Crazy Klown “ voice !
Listen up dirtbag! Detective Bozo has a very large safety pin in his pocket, and he's not afraid to use it!
Can you believe this Bozo?
No, CSI does not stand for Clown Scene Investigation
Take my word for it, he's the bad cop.
What kind of a wise guy asks for an English bulldog
A Mr Jeff Koons says it’s his, not yours.
So you've never heard of 'good cop, sad cop'?
Okay - time to get serious about this.
Alright, bud. You give us what we want and we'll give you what you want.
You have the right to remain stoic. Should you give up that right, any amusement can and will be used against you...
Okay, buster, this is your last chance to man up. Otherwise, it's enhanced interrogation!
Inform on the cartel and the dog is yours."
You flip kid and the balloon is yours.
He can do them all, and his shift's just starting.
Talk now, or we'll leave you alone in the room with Bozo until you do!
Maybe now that you have seen the way Mike handled that ballon you would like to tell us what really happened.
He told me you had a lot more to say at your 12th birthday party.
We found this in your suitcase; did you think you could pull something over on a well trained TSA clown?
so you think this is just some sort of circus , do ya
So, who's the "clown" now?
OK, bud. You clown around with us, we clown around with you!
We have someone that can place you at the circus, right Donny?
It ain't no laughing matter, Punk.
No, that is not Trump, that is one of our officers.
Budget Cuts Have Reduced Our Good Cop-Bad Cop Routine to a Bare Minimum.
TELL THE TRUTH AND YOU GET THE PUPPY?

If you think we're about to play a game of "bad cop, good cop", you'd better think again.
Yes, it's his real hair. Now what else can you tell us about the dog?
"Ever hear of 'good cop, bad clown'"?
Nobody will believe you that a clown beat the truth out of you.
No you said he's funny! Funny how??!! Like he's a clown? Like he amuses you?!
Sorry. The regular good cop is sick.
Our sketch artist is out sick, but Detective Pagliacci is filling in. Just don't go crazy with details, ok pal?
Officer Flopsy's dog says drugs...that's good enough for me.
we will not turn this trial into a circus
Sure, you can wait for your lawyer to get here... But I should tell you -- Birthday Boy's down the hall, singin' and blowin' out candles!
You don't really want to work here -- the place is a circus!
Actually, he's the bad cop...and he will squeeze the truth out of you!
Today’s your lucky day, pal. Meet special agent Bozo, from our twisted crimes division...
That's right, this isn't your Dad's good cop, bad cop.
I'm a sweetheart compared to my partner here. He'll have you in stitches.
Believe me punk, you're gonna wanna deal with me.
Listen Bozo, we know how to deal with someone like you.
You think we are funny, funny how, like clowns, we amuse you - how are we funny?
You can't make a clown out of Jim, because he already is one.
Good cop? No, he’s the VERY bad cop.
You have the right to an attorney. Officer Grant has your attorney.
'YES! He does parties too"
You're really not gonna like it when he starts honking his nose and chuckling.
Still won't talk? How about we bring in a mime.
You think I'm the bad cop?
We have ways of getting answers out of people.
That's right. Tell us the truth and it's all yours.
Good cop wasn't working out, so we've brought in funny cop.
And if we can tell you're not giving us the whole story, it'll be the entire birthday party package.
And if you still won't talk, we'll bring in the mime.
We know you're lying kid. This ain't our first rodeo ...
I suppose you think this is funny!
You think this is funny, punk?
Answer the question, pal, or your next stop is the fun house.
Look, kid, Detective Binky wants to give you that balloon. Nothing'd make him happier. The question is, am I gonna let him?
Come on kid...How much is that doggie with the weirdo?
Can you guess which one of us is the bad cop?
So you say you've never seen this balloon before?
You want the mime?
Do we look like we're clowning around, buddy?
We have whimsical ways to make you talk.
What part of 20 years to life do you find so funny?
Bear with us, our shrink is on vacation, so we're kind of winging it here. Now can you show me on this doll where the scary clown touched you?
We're not playing around here!
I think you know which is the good cop and which is the bad...
He’s the bad cop. I’m the worse cop.
Alright well this clearly isn’t working. Let’s just bring in the sketch artist.
It's good cop, evil clown cop now?!
Is this, or is this not, the horse you rode in on?
Let's go over your story one more time. A dog and a clown walked into a bar...

He's investigating funny money.
Do you think we’re clowning around here?
The bad cop is on vacation.
Believe me, I have an even badder cop....
You should be scared, where you’re going, the party is over.
That's right - I'm the good cop.
Show us where he touched you . . .
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
We're done playing nice, answer my questions or I bring in a mime.
I hear you are the ringmaster...
Now for a little "good cop, bad cop, balloon prop."
Start talkin' or Bobo will be glad to take you on a ride with seven of his friends in a tiny police cruiser.
Now quit making a clown outta my partner
Don't look at It! Look at me!
Listen, if you won't tell me what happened, Officer Koons here is going to make you appreciate his latest "work of art."
Bad cop, clown cop, kid. Your choice.
Yea, yea, you guessed it he's the good cop, I'm the bad cop.
The Bad Cop routine wasn’t scary enough.
He says you're the ringleader.
He is the good cop. I am the bad cop.
Good cop, bad cop was not working.
Either you tell us what you know, or the dog dies.
Listen kid, either talk to me now or I’ll give you a fate worse than death: 8 hours worth of watching Bozo over there make little balloon animals. It’s your choice.
This is a bad and an even worse cop scenario.
We're gonna play a little game called good cop, clown cop.
You think you’re Mr. Funny Business, don’t ya. Well, we’ll see who’s laughing when Detective Bubbles is through with you.
You don't want to know what the bad cop has prepared...
Is this funny to you?
Now imagine what he’ll do to your intestines if you don’t tell me what I want to know.
I suppose you think we're just a bunch of clowns, well do ya punk?
Does it look like we are clowning around here?
No. I'm the good cop. You don't wanna meet this sicko.
He's only here because you're a minor. The trial should be a full-blown circus.
How did you know he was an undercover cop?
There's something funny going on here!
What do you mean, "too representational?" Mr. Giggles' work is in the MET!
You had better think again. I'm not the bad cop!
I'm not clowning around!
Kid, this is not the time to clown around.
Alright Charlie, who do you think we are, the Keystone Cops?
This is all part of the routine.
Look, Scumbag. You either tell me what happened or I send in the clowns.

Well if I thought you were telling the truth, do you think I'd have brought in this clown?
We don’t want to get officer Jekyl angry now, do we?
Don't play dumb with me ? that's his job.
And you though I was your worst nightmare!
Listen pal, you think he’s annoying? I’ll give you one last chance to tell me what you saw, or else I’m bringing in the mime!
No good cop here. It's bad cop, evil clown!
Wise up kid! You’re not dealing with a couple of Bozo’s here.
I can't work with this clown anymore!
Look, I'm on your side here kid, but I can only protect you from Detective Chuckles if you work with me on this.
Say hello to my little friend!

Yeah sure, I’m the bad cop. But believe me, he ain’t so good either.
Wipe that smile off your face, the party is over!
It's our good cop, creepy cop routine. You got a problem with that?
You ain’t seen a bad cop ‘til you’ve tangled with Detective Chuckles here.

Look, he's the President of the company! Just tell him it looks like a dog!
Thanks to undercover officer Jangles here, you have heisted your last teeny weeny tiny car.
I have a balloon gun. Don't try me.
It’s called an Unhappy Meal.

Please cooperate or you’ll get good cop bad clown.
So, you think we're just playing around with you, huh?
Yeah, Einstein!! I am the bad guy here!!
Clowns and elephants are the pegs on which justice is hung!

Budget cuts
Talk or I send in the clowns!"

Officer Miranda says you have the right to this balloon dog.
Not so funny now, is it?

You think this is bad? Wait until he brings out the dummy.

Spill it or the dog gets it!
Per your plea deal, you get an hour with Gary the fun cop.
Trust me - you don't want to see him blow and twist YOU into a dog!
Son. It's about tradition.
And just what about this situation do you find funny?
You think this is funny? We aren't clowning around here!
Yes! This is our forensic team.
No you blew it out of proportion.
Mr. Zuckerberg, traditionally we have here the good-cop and the bad-cop. We decided to hire a clown-cop, in case you keep answering as you did in Congress.
Why him? Our bad cop's in anger management training.
Good cop, bozo cop.
Guess you can teach an old cop new tricks
Look sir, this is your final chance to sing before I “Send in The Clowns!”
For the last time, we can't afford a real sketch artist!
Meet Detective. Boswell...he’s angry and he’s got all night.
'Listen, we take our undercover K-9 team extremely seriously."
No one ever made a difference by being like everyone else.
Have you heard of good cop, deranged cop?
You've got exactly 5 minutes to come clean. After that, we release the police dog.
Yes, we have it on file that you are allergic to dogs.
You won't be laughing after my partner is through with you.
Is this entertaining to you?
Why does nobody ever believe I'm the good cop?
Then, when your daughter wasn’t looking you just threw this little fellow into the trash.
And don't say it's a horse of a different color.
Don’t mess with me son. For the last time I’m officer Bubbles and he’s officer O’Reilly.
You think this is some kind of a joke!
Oh yea? I'll show you not-funny.
Enough already! Just tell us why you didn't listen when this clown instructed you to place your laptop in a separate bin.
Why didn't you tell us it's your birthday?
A final bit of advice? Don't make the clown cry.
Maybe this will help you to remember...
Unfortunately for you our good clown is off tonight.
No, we're not playing good cop, sad cop.
You're ignoring the elephant in the room.
Still think you're the life of the party, punk?
‘ After I’m through with you my partner would like you to cheer him up.’
But what if we’re actually playing ‘Bad cop, Really bad clown?’
We can do this all day Bozo.
You've got your choice, good cop or bad clown.
Budget cuts are step this year, we can't afford our usual K-9 units
Don't make him bring out the water hose!
You better start squawking. I'm Good Cop.
And you thought I was the bad cop!
We can do this the hard way or we can do this the fun way.
Funny how? Like he’s here to amuse you?
You gonna confess--or does my partner need to squirt some WATER onto your FACE?!
You have a right to remain entertained
Fun cop or fu@k you up cop; take your pick.
Him dressed as a clown doesn’t make me the bad cop
Wipe that smile off your face, punk.
I told you were not clowning around
If you think I’m the bad cop, wait until you hear his joke.
Jamison, you've failed the exam for the last time. We can't let clowns like you on the force.
Is this what your dog looks like?
We’re done playing games.
Look, this is turning into a real circus
Or we can watch "Call me by my name" again. You decide.
Let's just say he has a method for handling bozos like you...
And on your birthday no less
Bozo will help you uninhibit those memories.
There's no such thing as an "innocent party" as Frank here will demonstrate.
This Clown’s not messing around. If you don’t talk you’ll gonna get Chuckles!
Ok pal, we're done clowning around.
Wrong! I'm good cop. He's your worst nightmare.
Dont make us go all 'Good Cop, Clown Cop' on you, Mr. King!
You asked for it. No more good cop. Now it's crazy clown.
Balloon static doesn't leave marks, just scars.
Uhh, no, we're alone. Just how many magic mushrooms did you take, Kid?
And, no, he cannot make balloon keys.
Last chance or he goes from puppies to swords.
Don’t think for a second we can’t Mutt and Jocko you all day long bub.
Is this the person you voted for?
Alright buddy, no more funny business!
Good cop, scary cop.
You're so stupid, you got tracked down by a balloon dog.
You'll talk or no more bad cop / bozo cop.
Look kid, we're sensitive cops, and we want make sure you enjoy the moment.
I'm the good cop. His jokes will kill you.
This is your last chance to confess before I bring in the mime.
So, you really think you got what it takes to be my Secretary of State?! Huh?!! Huh?!!!
Do you think this is some kind of joke, Kowalsky?
Listen cadet, you've got some big shoes to fill.
If you want that balloon animal, you better start talking.
That phone call thing is old news. These days, you get a balloon animal.
This case is a joke! It's absolutely inflated!
Talk now, or he makes the dog squik.
The balloon animal isn't what you think it's for!
Talk! Or you are going to hear that balloon squeak again.
Everybody loves a clown, what is your problem?
We know how to make you talk.
Don't take us for clowns, pal.
The polygraph machine is broken.
Are we goint to do this the easy way or the clown way?
Talk or the dog gets it. No funny business.
That's right, he was undercover. You sold this blow to a cop.
So you're saying it was all just fun and games until some clown and his dog showed up.
What the hell did you just call my partner?
Look, I’m the good cop. You don’t want to have to deal with the bad cop.
You've never heard of good cop, clown cop?
You think this is funny?! Wait until you see the next guy.
I'm the bad good cop and he's the good bad cop.
Good cop / bad cop doesn't seem to work anymore. We're trying something new.
Confess now, or else we give you the Third Hee-Hee!
Yes, that is a dog
Tell us where the money is, and Bonzo will make a giraffe.
It's time for 'bad cop' to turn you over to 'mad cop'!
This is no joke. Meet my partner Bozo.
You better tell me what I need to know ‘cause this guy’s not clowning around.
This isn’t a joke. Our sketch artist is out sick.
Look, kid, this ain’t a circus, and we’re not a bunch of clowns, ya know!
OK, no more Mr. Nice Guy...Joe he's all yours
Now tell us what you want on your birthday cake!
Give it up now, punk, because we all know Detective Chuckles will break you.
Are you ticklish?
We have ways of making you talk!
Oh, so you want to do this the squeaky way.
This IS a laughing matter, buster.
OK, he's a bit of a Bozo, but that's what happens when a good cop turns bad
Confess, or he’ll start juggling.
It's time to get down to monkey business.
That’s right, Buster... Bobo was the po-po.
Just tell us what happened, no funny stuff.
If this doesn't break you, we'll stage a mime marathon.
We'll see if you still remain silent with our good cop, bad joke cop routine.
No, I'm the Good Cop. So you'd better start talking.
Don't cooperate and he makes the Trump balloon.
Book this clown.
Look, kid; you can either talk to me, or I turn you over to our K-9 officer and his partner, Killer.
You tell me the truth or deal with the Fixer.
After him, we bring in a mime.
We've got an eye witness here who says you did it.
Now show me on the balloon animal where the bad man touched you.
Detectives Davis and Frazier implement the department's new 'bad cop - funny cop' interrogation technique.
Scene from “Dirty Bono” I know what you’re thinking. Did he make 6 twists or only 5? But before he brings in his seltzer bottle, that would wash your face clean off, You’ve got to ask yourself one question: “Do I feel lucky?” Well, do ya, punk?
Can you honestly say you've never seen this dog?
And if you don’t come clean Downtown, we might have to take you to Clowntown...Trust me, nobody wants that.
Sorry sir, we don't clown around when it comes to crime, just ask my colleague.
You think this is funny? A man is dead!
We're through clowning around with you.
Still won't talk, eh? Detective Chuckles, get the tricycle!
And now you'll see why I'm the GOOD cop.
Listen sonny, the gig’s not over until I say it’s over.
Say hello to our Good Cop, you slimeball.
Lawyer or balloon animal. Your choice.
If you don’t start talking, Officer Bozo will make balloon animals all night long.
He double-majored in cops and clowns.
Talk, or he'll bust your balloon!
If you don't confess soon, we'll bring on the dancing horses.
Confess and he’s all yours.
We’ll see if your statement matches the survellience footage on Officer Bozo’s dash cam...
Actually, I'm the good cop.
You wanna play tough? This will be your colon in jail!
You want to clown around with us? You got it!
Lets see if Mr Tickle can make you talk.
Diversity Regulations require "good cop bad clown" once per week, so don't get any ideas bucko!
Your puppy mill is going down.
You’re really starting to upset my partner.
So this is what you guys mean when you talk about "good cop, bad cop"?
So, you think this is funny, do you?
Okay kid, tell me what I want to know or I leave you alone in the room with the clown.
A confession now or, POP GOES YOUR POODLE!
It’s up to you. You can deal with good cop or clown cop.
You're in no position to clown around with us.
'We can do this the easy way, or the silly way'
Ok, kid, describe the guy to our balloon artist, Sgt. Chuckles.
The bad news is, as of today you're no longer a minor. The good news is, Detective Russo loves birthdays.
My partner's got ways of making you talk, and don't say I didn't warn you...he's pretty twisted.
NO! Guess again. I got ALL night.
He lost the coin toss.
You gotta another thing coming if you think we're clowning around!
What is this? Bad cop, clown cop?
We use Sargeant Bozo when we interrogate millennials.
The undercover clown saw what you did to this balloon animal..
We submitted to all your demands, now spill the beans.
We can make this hard or we can make this hilarious.
So you don't want to talk to local cops? OK. Maybe you'll be a bit more cooperative with my colleague and former Director of the FBI, James Comey.
You think we're clowning around?
stop clowning around and answer the question !
...”and, to encourage you to reconsider, you will be left in this room with Officer ‘Horsey,’ who will perform knock-knock jokes, gorilla imitations and squeaky ballon twisting for an extended period of time.
We can play it straight or play it your way.
Look, we've been at this for hours... now who's the ringleader!?
'If he doesn't make you talk, he will certainly wipe the smile off your face!'
Tell us where he is and then you can have a balloon animal!!
We do the good cop-bad cop routine a little differently.
If not a dog balloon, how about a solitary room?
Just so you know, I'm the good one.
Trust me. You won't like Officer Giggles when he gets angry.
C'mon, kid, come clean. We're dead serious about this.
Trust me; stay away from that clown.
Yes, I am the "bad cop," but we found him to be much more effective than the "good cop.
Don't mind Kowalski... he came in last minute, from his other job, in order to help out.
It's up to you, pal. We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the scary clown way.
Admit to your plagiarism Koons, or IT can get ugly.
We have ways of making you squeal!
We got ways of makin' ya talk, kid.
Additionally, anything you say may be used in my partner's upcoming biopic, Patch Adams 2.
You talk now or I turn you over to Mr Wiggly Buggly.
You think this funny, kid?
Which one of you is supposed to be the bad cop?
This is our sketch artist Frank. He's the best we've got, when it comes to cases like yours.
That's right we're playing good guy, clown guy.
Is the president joining us?
Confess, or I'll leave you alone in here with him, and turn the lights off.
The balloon holds air but your story doesn't.
All right, wise guy, we'll see if 'Mr. Good Cop' can get anything out of you.
Are you in serious trouble? What do you think, kid?
Don’t tell me you’re sorry! Tell it to the dog!
Yeah? Well, we know just how to deal with a Bozo like you!
Yes, as a matter of fact, our new interrogation technique is "good clown, bad clown".
I'll answer your questions when you guys stop clowning around.
You say the man you saw leaving Trump Tower wore a RED tie?
Day 24 of the sketch artist strike...
Hey punk, stop staring and show some respect for the chief's craftsmanship.
Our Community Relations Officer, Sergeant Kelso, will be performing some magic tricks prior to your interrogation.
Or, if you do decide to testify, we can get you started with Clara here who has been in our Witness Protection program since she was about your age.

If you can not afford an attorney Officer Bozo will be appointed to make balloon figures for you.
Talk or the balloon hat is next!
The courts banned using a rubber hose. But this is going to hurt just as much.
My partner here says you're the ringleader!
I'm the good cop. He's the bad cop. And there are 23 more like him waiting in the squad car.
And if you give up your supplier, he'll also make you a cool sword.
You have the right to remain silent, but we'll go easier on you if you do it while pretending to be stuck in a tiny box.
I suggest you tell me, otherwise I'll leave you with the clown . . .
Made you look.
Alright, no more funny business.
We're gonna play a little game. It's called good cop,bad clown.
OK, we're done....the clown squeeks the dog until you talk.
It's your call, kid. Either talk to me now or Agent Squeaky takes us down balloon animal Highway to Hell.
So you go back in there and mix with the kids. Listen for any smack talk about snatching Officer Bobo's shower cap.
This is your last chance to come clean before I turn the interrogation over to my partner.
My partner doesn’t play games.
So you admit to Officer Bozo that this is your counterfeit ballon dog?
Big mistake ... he's NOT the good cop.
Quit clowning around!
Kid, you better start laughing or else the little dog dies.
Do you want the good cop or the bad cop?
Frankly, we're both a little sick of the "Good Cop - Bad Cop" analogy...
Your call, Bozo.
Alright, Bozo...we'll do it your way.
A new take on police interrogation. Bad cop, terrifying cop.
Okay, Pagliacci, it's time to face your inner demon.
Well look at the time, it's happy hour.
You'd be better off confessing now, son ... we are your worst nightmare!
Listen, we've all got our vices.
Do you think this is funny? No seriously... do you?
Answer my questions or you deal with the clown
This isn't going to be a good Bozo bad Pennywise kind of interrogation.
I know it won't help us find Rover, but just tell him it's a good likeness. He needs this.
You want to explain why our top dog was sniffing your luggage?
It might seem this way to you, buddy, but this is not a circus!!
There's no such thing as 'good clown.'
Think of it as inviting some friends to your little party.
They were finally able to coerce a confession from the suspect using the classic "Good Cop, Clown Cop" tactic.
He specializes in juvenile interrogation.
Officer, that is not my dog. It doesn’t even look like him.
Trust me. You do NOT want the "Good Cop/Bad Clown" treatment.
Let me guess...good cop, bad clown.
LIMERICK: Bozo the Cop, in a costume he'd dress...Designed his routine to encourage duress...He'd twist up your nuts...Like balloon animal mutts...and, in the end, you'd confess.
OK mister! We're through clowning around! You tell us what we wanna know, or we'll sic the dog on you!!
It's time to stop clowning around.
Tell us what you know or Joe will pop that poodle, one body part at a time.
Don’t laugh, Punk, this is serious.
We take pride in what we do.
John has a tendency to carry the "good cop" roll a little overboard.
Here we play "bad cop, clown cop."
It's time to give us something---Chuckles here is not your typical good cop.
We're not clowning around.
Tell us what we want to hear or he deflates the balloon animal
Want to play games, do you?
Listen up scumbag, my partner has a few jokes he'd like to tell you.
If we don't hear something that makes sense, he starts dancing the hokey-pokey.
Wipe that stupid grin off your face.
Believe me, I'm the good guy.
Jo-Jo prefers to use intestines, so I’d recommend talking now.
The old tricks just don't work anymore Steve
‘You better answer my questions; I guarantee you won’t enjoy talking with Sergeant Sprinkles.”
He's got a few tricks up your ass.
Tell us what happened or we Send for the Clowns who squirt seltzer.
Hold up guys...he said he wanted his lawyer pro-BONO.
You can't outwit the Chief of Funny Business and his balloon K-9 here.
Listen Bozo; we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
Stop smirking. Funny cop-bad cop always get their man to sing.
Okay fella, we can do this the easy way or the hard way— and I don’t think you know which one is which
You better start talking, or I'll turn you over to "The Clown."
Just talk already, we've been juggling witnesses all day.
Yes, this is the only clown speaking interpreter we could find...now listen!
Speaking as the good cop, trust me--you don't want to mess with Clown Cop...
You don't wanna get into the funny business, pal.
You think this is funny? You think I’m joking? How ‘bout you talk to my partner, tough guy?
Am I starting to look more like the ‘bad cop’ now, buddy?
Bozo is filling in for the good guy
Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time or my friend here will put a pie in your face!
Is this how he looked just before you shot him?
Don't look at him, look at me, I'm the real cop.
Talk or he'll do the same thing to you.
You'd better talk right now or Officer Bubbles will be late for his other gig.
He can and will make anything.
Confess! "You were caught in the act, giving this animal balloon to an undercover clown"
We've been monitoring you. If he can't get you to talk, a bag of snakes is outside.
Well you had your chance, now my partner will have a little fun with you!
Officer Chortles, looks like today's the day you'll be able to exercise that itchy seltzer finger.
That's not the good cop. That's my brother-in-law.
You wanna know why you didn't hear our Canine Unit on your trail, kid?
Do you think this is some kind of joke?
You think I'm unreasonable, but this guy's hysterical!
Well Bozo over here says he caught you trying to blow up a puppy!
Trust me. I'm the good cop!
This clown has only one thing in mind...
You're right. This is classic good clown, bad cop.
Look, Kid, I hope you don't think we're clowning around here.
It’s storytime, fella! Spit it out.
Better get the squirting flower for this one.
You can confess now or spend the next ten years with Sgt. Bobo here.
We're trying out our good cop, sad clown cop routine.
It's worse than you think -- HE'S the 'bad cop.'
Talk, Punk, or be seltzer-boarded.
You don't want to know the other ways we have to make you laugh.
You are one twisted dog.
You may think I'm the bad cop in this situation, but you've clearly not seen 'It'
Confess, before the Joker comes in and you'll be stuck. In the middle. With me, punk!
I'm done playing nice. It's time for Sargent Peepers, whose got a few tricks up his sleeve.
"Don't clown around with us kid. Did you or did you not pop a balloon animal like this one during an NRA rally last week?
Listen here, dirtbag, it still makes more sense than your alibi.
Next week on CSI.
This method is a little something we call "Good Cop, Clown Cop"!
Officer Collins here has been deep undercover in your black market children's party racket for two years now.
You mean to tell me that after all his creative work, you stand by your story that you see a giraffe and not a dog?
Yeah, it's confusing. I'm the good cop.
Expecting the ol' Good Cop/Bad Cop routine were ya?....Well my friend, you're in Sarasota now.

Ok, kid. Good cop here, very bad cop there!
You cooperate or it’s another good cop, bad clown routine
You’re absolutely right – playing good cop, bad cop isn’t going to work on you. So we’re just gonna move right ahead to bad cop, evil clown.
Swipe that smile off your face. I’m the good cop.
Okay, there's your dog. Now talk.
If you think we're not serious, we'll bring in the bad clown.
Sir, does this interrogation seem funny to you?
Oh? You think this is funny?? We can play this game aaaall day, kid.
...and there's an accordian player waiting in lineup.
Kid, you better come clean now, because I promise you, you are not gonna like my partner.
Admit your guilt or that clown will force you to watch balloon tricks till you do.
He's staying until you tell us what you know.
I'm the good cop. He's the bad clown.
The good guy bad guy routine is not what we are about.
Stop clowning around Johnson, we've got an interrogation to do!
You were the only one at the party with Crazy Glue.
So you think this is funny, punk!!
Listen buddy, I asked you to stop singing Sondheim.
So, you won't talk? Ok then. Neither does my partner!
If you can be a good little witness, my partner will give you the puppy.
OK, no more good cop.
Talk, or we'll send in the clowns.
When this guy’s done with you, you’re going to wish you were dead.
no, no, it's not my birthday!
You think we're clowning around here?
You wanna do this the hard way or the fun way?
Listen son, we're done jumping through hoops here.

Because HR says I have to embrace a climate of cultural diversity! Now answer the damn question!
Stop clowning around and tell us who the bozo was!
Ah, the old good cop clown cop routine
I don’t need punks like you out there making my department look like a Circus!
Talk or will sic the dog on you...
Hold up, who are you calling a bozo?
OK buddy. This is how it is. - regular cop - not so funny cop. Take your pick.
Quit clowning around, my eyes are right here.
Spill the beans already! Does it look like we're clowning around here?
Surprise! Detective Bozo found the murder weapon.
Admit it. You are a acupuncturist.

Don't make me bring in the Bad Clown.
In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.

The confetti was a match and now your going to the big top for a long, long time !
So, you say it was Bozo, in the romper room, with the ballon dog.
Somebody must have wanted that balloon pretty bad to pull a twisted stunt like that!
Actually, he plays Psycho-Cop. Tell the truth or the dog pops!
Don’t want to talk? Then I’m sending in the clown.
Good cop/bad cop just wasn't working anymore, so we're trying out angry cop/sullen clown this week. So far, it's testing under last week's silly cop/angry bartender, but if you'd just fill out our questionnaire...
We have a witness to the cruelty to animals charge
We're not clowning around.
Good Cop, Bozo Cop. Don’t make me do it.
Enough with the balloon animals. If you don’t tell us what we want to know Lieutenant Matthews will bring out the puppets.
We've replaced good cop/bad cop with bad cop/creepy clown cop.

Fess up or he makes more animals with squeaky balloons.
With your help we’re gonna pin the tail on this donkey.
Oh, wiseguy, huh? Think you're a joker? Take over, Bob...
He's the good clown. I'M the bad clown.
You'll wish you talked to me. I'm the good guy here.
Cooperate or the clown, here, will squeeze and twist you like he did that balloon.
OK. We can do this the hard way or the zany way.
You think he's the good cop? He's got a seltzer bottle . . . and he'll use it.
There are 14 more of him in the squad car.
Well, maybe I'm NOT the bad cop!
My partner will be continuing your interrogation. He’s no one to laugh at.
Okay, okay. You're right. I'm the bad cop, he's the good cop.
Let’s just say you don’t want to see his bad clown.
He lives in a Volkswagen with nine brothers. Don't mess with him!
No, he's not a clown----he was born that way!
You wanna talk to the good cop? Trust me detective Pennywise is NOT your friend!
We're doing sensible cop, silly cop.
We know about twisted guys like you.
Alright pal, I guess we're gonna do this the hard way.
Won't talk? No problem. Twisty here can squeak all day.
Once he twists your arm you'll start talking.
The department is under a consent decree with the DOJ, so we're trying a new spin on the old "good cop/bad cop" routine.
Sir, we're trying to find the dog that bit you but our sketch artist is off today."
He also draws missing people.
Uh oh, his happy face is turning into a sad face.
Talk or I turn you over to the good cop.
Is this the clown that arrested you?
Officer McDonald from the K-9 unit will be taking over the interrogation now.
Ya' better come clean, son, or I'll have to leave you alone in this room with my new partner, Jim Comey.
We have ways of making you talk and/or squeal with joy.
You think we're just here to clown around?
Your temporary insanity plea is gonna get you sent straight to the baloony bin.
Now you're gonna tell us everything - except your honest opinion on the role of clowns.
That's right,Sonny,I'm the good cop.
Tell me the truth or the clown will take over...you do NOT want that to happen.
OK Jimmy have it your way. The party is over. Let me introduce you to Chuckles. Don't let the name fool you, he knows every trick in the book.
And I see dead people! Cut the crap.
Unless you play nice, we're prepared to send in the clowns.
You're insulting the man who breathed life into our K9 unit.
You see, Mr. Chuckles here is one of our finest undercover operatives.
If we don’t get some answers, we’re gonna have to go birthday clown on you, and you don’t want that, Carl.
I was clowning around. Is that a crime?
What don't you understand about no more funny business?
Sure, it's all fun and laughs, until it ISN'T!
I don’t know much about art, but I know what I like.
Who gave you the idea of transferring to clown school?
is that where you touched the clown, or not?
This is serious. Look at me when I'm talking to you, I'm not some clown.
Had enough?
Your choice! Bad cop or Clown cop - there is no good cop.
Now, Detective Angelini here is going to help jog your memory: There was a large McDonald's bag on the front seat of our cruiser....
Ironically, he's the bad cop.
You tell the truth, you get the dog. We think you're lying, it gets popped.
Quit messing with me. Do I look like a clown to you?
Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. I said, "Is this your balloon doggy!"
Alright buddy, you've left us no choice but to resort to the ridiculous cop
Detective Blizzo here is a fully certified forensic balloon artist. Just tell him which animal the suspect looks like and we will begin our investigation.
Look, we're not joking around here.
Wipe that smirk off your face. Did you or did you not blow his clown cover by mocking his balloon animal?
Good cop bad clown - you’d better talk
You can confess now or spend you can spend hours watching more of Sargent Bozo's balloon tricks.
Here's how he solved the crime in pantomime.
Yeah well I thought I’d seen it all too kid, and then they made Wavy Gravy my new partner.
If you don't stop pretending you see a Police Clown, I'm 5150-ing you. Now again, tell me what you saw the night the Circus came to town.
You're gonna need to find a zombie because I got over my fear of clowns.
Well? Is this funny to you?
Just answer my questions, and no clowning around.
Clowns? I don't see any clowns! All I see is a witness who doesn't know the difference between a "party entertainer" and an accomplished sculptor making a statement.
I'm the sardonic one
He's the only sketch artist we've got.
We are not monkeying around here!!
You can talk to me and I won't squirt you in the face, honk your nose, or buzz your palm, but my partner, here, he can't make any promises.
No; he's the good cop!
Look, you can answer my questions or I can send in the clowns.
Bad cop or bad clown?
Your choice. Come clean now or we'll coax the truth out of you.
Sir, the other balloon dog didn’t just walk away by itself.
This way we get confessions quicker than with the old good cop, bad cop routine.
Detective Ronald thinks you're twisting the truth.
Listen, kid. This isn't a circus.
Our sketch artist is on vacation so please describe your assailant to Detective Chuckles.
Do you think we’re just clowning around?
The new allergy friendly K-9 unit has been surprisingly effective at eliciting confessions.
Confess and you get the balloon toy!
It would make my day, to make your day.
Don't make us water nose you.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Look kid, we can do this the hard way...
New sketch artist. Did the assailant happen to be a dog, giraffe, or flower?
We have finished clowning around,
Talk! or ready to face your deepest fear.
Don't make me pull a rabbit out of my hat!
We take having fun as a team very seriously.
Now we send in the clowns
Well what did you think the C in CSI stood for!?
So you get that he's good-cop, right?
Are you ready to get serious?
You think it's all fun games. I'm warning you, tough guy, don't make me bring in the mime!
So you’re telling me that right now, you’re seeing a clown doing balloon magic. Take him away!
I was just clowning around, officer.
Okay punk, are you ready to be scared silly?
We get serious about clowning-around, bud!
You can remain silent, but I have to send in the clown.
Look, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the annoying way.
He can also make a sword and a hat.
You can either answer my questions or you can sit through Captain Bobo's magic balloon extravaganza.
I suggest you answer my questions. Despite his appearance,my partner doesn't clown around
On a scale of cop to clown, how would you rate your visit here today?
Work with me Kid or things can can get pretty scary...
We don't do the good cop bad cop routine in this town son !
Now, tell me everything you know, or you're going to get It.
I did not invite the President, he just showed up!
He can do alot else with that balloon. Talk whle you can.
I didn't want to have to resort to this, but you left me no choice. Clown, begin the squeak torture!
No kidding!
Fine, he’ll put on the big shoes and the striped suit - but you’ve got to start talking!
Y'know what's funny? I'm actually the funny cop...
One of us is joking
No more balloon animals until you answer some of my questions.
Detective Johnson is actually there, but we like to pretend we can't see him to make you admit you're high.
Are you trying to make a laughing matter of our criminal justice system?
Listen, fella, all I'll say is that I'm the good cop in this scenario.
Are you saying the "Clown Cop, Bad cop" strategy isn't effective?
Good cop bad cop got nixed by Justice, so we are trying something new
We're not fooling around here, fess up!
I was going to play the bad cop, but it looks like that's changed.
And he'll continue to make that squeaky noise until you squeal!
Don't make him take out the seltzer!
Listen here, Bozo.
stop clowning with me kid, we know the who, what, where and when; tell us why a dog!
Hey, we're not kidding around here young man. Right Detective Bozo?
Remember that little circus incident when you were a kid?
Your story seems reasonable, but something doesn't check out. Does that look like a poodle to you? Does it punk?
You see him too? Oh, thank God. I was afraid all those years of keistering 'shrooms had finally caught up with me.
Your buddy cracked, and now you're going to crack a smile too.
Maybe "Good Cop, Bad Cop" didn't work, but "Send In the Clowns" never fails.
Look, we all heard the pop!
Look I'm pooched so lets not clown around!
My partner here thinks he's holding the scales of justice, and who am I to say otherwise?
Well now I understand how you made it, but smuggling it must have been uncomfortable.
Listen here, what type of people do you peg us as?
I'm the good cop, dumbass.
Is he the good cop?
Bimbo. But it's officer Bimbo to you, kid.
So, you think all cops are clowns, eh?
If he's the 'good cop' just imagine what I am !
Good cop, bad cop, you know the drill.
Does this amuse you?
Is this an accurate balloon rendering of the offending canine?
Maybe you think this is funny, kid ?
Ok, Sondheim! Do you deny telling us to send in the clowns?
That's us, Good Cop and Very Bad Cop.
I want to see a lawyer, not one of your legal clowns.
I was sure they had nothing on me. Then the forensic specialist walked in.
Book 'em Bozo
Affirmative action has really gotten out of hand
So, you can talk to me--or Bonzo will show you his whole menagerie.
If you think I'm clowning around, just wait'll my partner gets to you.
You better start talking. I'm the good cop!
I’m going to ask you one last time. Why so serious?
Nobody likes a clown buddy!
Yep, we ARE doing the good cop/scary-kinda-creepy-clown-cop-with-balloon-animals cop routine. Now talk, or you get squirted ny the daisy again!
Does this put your fear of dogs in perspective?
Don’t make me get the clown involved.
Our special department was set up to catch clowns like you.
...and I'm the Good Cop, Jenkins. Just keep that in mind.
We have been directed to use police tactics that mirror those of the lawyers who will handle the case.
Listen pal, this isn't a game of good cop sad clown.
What good cop/bad cop routine?
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
We can do this the sad way or the funny way. Up to you . . .
If you can tell me whose the good cop and the bad cop in this scenario, Bobo won't twist you up like this golden balloon-doodle.
Do you know why we’ve brought you in for this improvisation?
Oh, so you think you're a funny guy, huh? I'll show you funny!

So your saying that your company was hacked and the information used was to predict the next President?
Tell us now or this place is going to fill up in a way you won't believe.
I'm sorry about your wife's murder.
Here's the bad news: *I'm* the good cop.
For the last time, we are both bad cops!
You're gonna want to talk to me. Most people find Officer Squeakums to be even more... well, persuasive...
Oh, you think this is some trial balloon from a bunch of bozo's?
Is he a cop or clown? Is that a dog or ballon? Not trying to be difficult, but i have rights, this is America the Unusal!
no clowning around
He used to be a punk like you, but he wised up and went straight.
He prefers not to be labeled.
All you tech-bros think this is funny, do ya? I 'll show you funny.
Confess, or the dog gets it.
You'd better own up to it! I'm the good cop!
My friend Bozo will talk to you now. No funny business, okay?
#unamused
Don't let the balloon animal and the rubber nose fool you... he's the bad cop.
It's about time you made up your mind, Ronald - Law studies or acting classes?
What makes you think this is a "good cop, bad cop" interrogation?
For the last time, is this the clown you saw in that Russian peeing video?
Tell us everything you know now, or my pal "Twisty" here is going to be late to a birthday party.
Only one of us appears to be taking this seriously.
My colleague won't be as nice as me
This is no laughing matter, Bud
We're employ a different policing ethic. no more rubber hoses, now it's balloon animals. When we want to get rough, we bring in his partner, the mime.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the funny way...and safe word Uncle won't do you any good here.
Getting him out of those ridiculous shoes was no small feat.
Now we can do this easy or we can do this hard. I'm easy.
Are you sure that isn’t your dog?
Sir, we know about the needles, we have a witness
Yes, it's good cop, bad clown.
I'm the bad clown
We warned you! - If you don't stop your funny business we start ours.
Everybody says they want to save the Rec Center, but nobody wants to do the grunt work.
Believe me...we do not clown around.
I would take the dog. It might be worth something when you get out!
We called in an expert, and it's definitely your face paint on the victim.
OK fine, he'll make a poodle if you confess.
We used to give cigarettes, but no one is smoking anymore.
Good cop, bozo cop.
I am the good cop and he is the clown cop.
Maybe this hideous sight will help jog your memory.
Its only one day and Mr. Giggles will show you how to face paint and do animal balloons.
There's a Bozo in this room, and I'm looking right at him.
We can do this the easy way or the clown way, your choice.
Listen Buddy! You better talk or he's gonna release the hound on you.
And when Clown Cop third degrees your funny bone, you'll be tickled pink to talk.
Did you really think I would crack under that old good cop, clown cop routine?
That's right. It's the old good cop bad clown routine.
Better talk fast...before he becomes the bad cop.
Murder is no laughing matter.
No, he doesn’t do birthday parties. But does this resemble the dog you saw at the scene of the crime?
The dog is all the probable cause we need.
Sources tell us that some of you clowns have even wormed your way onto the police force!
Nooooo, I'm the good cop!
He'll just keep making them so you better talk!
Don’t make us poke holes in your story.
...so you think my partner Gacy here is the good cop?...
I'm tired of this its time to start clowning around!
No. This is the good clown.
No officer, I would never say that cops are clowns.
Good cop, Wacko cop
Please accept my job offer so I can get rid of this clown.
Good cop is stressed.
We are not amused.
Good, bad or funny and mad, just answer my questions!
Your cover has been blown!
And believe me, there's plenty more where that came from.
Stop smirking. This is serious!
Tell me again exactly where you were and the exact time that you said some clown stole your toy balloon.
No, I'm the GOOD cop. Can't you see he's a CLOWN?
Tough guy, huh? All right, Simmons, take over.
We've found the murder weapon. Now tell me - how the hell are we blowing this out of proportion?
I'm Pennywise an' this here's my partner, Twisty. Don't make us play "bad clown, really bad clown."
Look pal, either you tell us who else was at the scene or Bozo here is going to give you an intimate demonstration in the art of making balloon animals..
Now I'm going to show you a clown with class.
Yes, he’s the bad cop. Where have you been?
Fred decided today is the day he'd follow his true passion.
The reason we called you in here Mr. Robertson is that we need you to go undercover as a class clown.
So if you're the bad cop, what's he?
I'm The Bad Cop- He's The Good Cop !
Alright, no more funny business! That's Officer Bozo's M.O.
You get the clown costume back when you teach me how to make that balloon animal!
You're telling me this is what the clown looked like?
You either speak to me or deal with this clown
Coco's got the stolen Rococo and you know nothing what am I Bozo ?
You don't believe I'm serious? I'll show you serious!
You've never SEEN good cop, bad cop.
Are you saying Officer Trumpet is making fake evidence?
He's from CSI: Clown Squad Interrogation.
You should know, he's the "GOOD" cop!
You better deal with me. I’m the good cop.
I can make it worse than “good cop / bad cop.”
It wasn't me. Really, I'm not the one clowning around.
This killer is one cladistic son of a gun.
You've got it backwards: I'M good cop.
How about my partner here ties a scenario you may not like?
No, this is a good-cop/clown-cop routine. Can you identify the dog?
I'll be the one asking the questions!
Good cop, funny cop did not prove to be effective.
Or we can go to see Spider-Man musical, you decide.
Help me help you, pal. You do NOT want to smell Detective Whiptickle's flower.
We have the party animal's ID....so let it out.
Start talking, jackass. We've got 42 more just like him behind that door.
I am going to give you five minutes to confess to the good cop before I return.
You’d better start telling the truth otherwise he’ll bring out the custard pie detector.
if you're not going to answer my question he's going to pop the dog.
Time for the old "good cop, clown cop" routine
And if you wanna play it hard - my trick is sawing someone in half.
Larry found your missing dog, sir.
Look, I know he's a Bozo, but he's our Bozo and he makes whatever animal he wants. Got it!?
Yeah I'm the bad cop and the other is REALLY good
Jeff Koons said that he wasn't anywhere near the kid's party
Aren't you supposed to try bad cop/good cop not bad cop/clown cop?
What is this? Bad cop, silly cop?
Listen, this is your last chance. If you don't start talking, I'll bring in a mime next.
Our sketch guy is sick kid so use your imagination.
You be the judge. He learned his technique from John Wayne Gacy.
Won’t talk, tough guy? Just wait until he breaks out the squirting boutonniere and whoopie cushion, you’ll talk.
Listen! I really don't want to release the juvy K-9 unit on you.
Hard nut to crack, huh? Well we can play games too!
Now we're gonna play a little round of Good Cop, Clown Cop.
You realize you're facing twenty years in the slammer, pal! What's so funny!
Okay, so who’s the good cop again? Remember, I’m afraid of clowns.
Blinky's makes balloon animals and gets people to talk. And he's all out of balloons...
What's so funny, punk?
If you won't talk to me, I'll have to turn you over to Detective Pennywise!
Talk... if you want to avoid this becoming a circus
How old were you last night?
I’m not falling for the good-cop, bad-clown routine.
Is this funny to you, punk?
Who's asking the questions around here? Budget cuts are none of your concern.
So, who's playing bad cop today?
A clown, a tramp, a police detective. Tonight's cast of players on the odd stage-known as- the Twilight Zone.......
No, I am not Mr. Rogers and you cannot have a kitty cat.
You need any arm twisting?
The good cop / bad clown routine always breaks 'em down, son. You may as well spill.
Soooo...no more sketch artists ever?
Talk. He can make a sword next...
Now we start the ballon-boarding!
Our department prefers to not clown around, kid.
This can be easy or it can be hard. You either tell me what I want to know or Bozo here will make you sit through 2 hours of him making balloon animals.
Tell the truth or your dog is a goner!
Did you make this Jeff Koons' dog and try to sell it on the black market to the Bozo cop?
Time to play “good cop, bad cop”.
The usual tactics weren't working, so the detective had to resort to good cop clown cop.
If you think I'm tough, wait till you meet Bozo.
Good Cop vs Clown Cop
We’ve brought in a interpreter who speaks ‘wise guy’ for you.
Listen punk, ya can't lie to us like we're BOTH clowns.
Don’t clown around with me, our dog smelled the dope on you.
No, this is not the old 'good cop nightmare cop' routine.
Talk to me, or my partner is gonna rub that thing on his head and stick it on you.
Say hello to Officer Chuckles.
If your chosen method of interrogation is confusion, you got me.
Oh, you think you’re funny, do ya? Well, let’s see if you think this funny.
Satisfied? Now tell us what you did to Frank.
Look for the last time, we're not clowning around here. Whatever gives you that idea?
I want to go easy on you, but my partner here wants to annoy you with squeaky noises.
Don't tempt Lenny. He can make a Shepherd just as fast.
Guess which one is funny cop.
His act is so bad, you will be talking to skip the show.
First your information has to lead to an arrest, then you can have the reward.
Just to be clear, he likes balloons and that’s how he treats them.
Why bring Jeff goons into this?
Officer Smiley, give him the tickles!
Yes, it’s a serious crime to lie to a clown.
The clown? He used to work at the White House.
We do have a support animal with a histrionics voice coach, if that helps.
Do you think you're the first Bozo to come through this station-house?
Detective Chuckles won't talk either. His seltzer does the talking.
Ok now for some bad cop....clown cop
Ah, so I see you are going with the old bad cop, annoying cop routine.
No, we don't play "good cop- bad cop" here. Right, Sgt. Sillibubs?
After a disappointing 1 star rating on yelp, the interrogation department starts to experiment with new customer satisfaction initiatives
Time to stop clowning around. We need answers!
Should we do this the easy way? Or the delightful way?
"You better talk, or the balloon dog gets it." *holds pin*
He claims he wasn't with you that night.
He's all fun and games now but you're gonna see how rough it can get if he has to go back and put on his angry face.
Don't even think about running - I have a squad car with 30 more officers parked outside.
Let's see how airtight your alibi is, clown.
Intellectual property theft without artistic license is no laughing matter
Talk now or we send him to your kid’s birthday party for a couple of hours.”
So you say you've never seen this balloon animal before in your life, huh?
He arrests guilty parties and then plays kids' parties.
Sending in the bad cop, huh?
Do you really wanna face Blinky the Bad Cop?
No, we are not playing good clown, bad clown.
Tim, I care about you. Tell me what happened and I won't have to leave you alone with "Sex Game Larry."
You know the drill. We can do this the hard way. The easy way. Or the silly way.
Alright smart guy, we don’t look kindly at those who pop animal balloons.
So, you think I'm the bad cop? Wait until Sgt. Pennywise here takes over the interrogation!
It's called "Good cop, fun cop."
You can either sign a confession or face dying of laughter.
Well if you don't know what "ignorantia juris non excusat" means - maybe you've heard of a little something called a leash law!!!
Actually, I'm the good cop. He's the bad cop--a very bad cop.
Suck it up! Coulrophobia is not in the DSM 5.
Officer Bozo says he caught you molesting his balloon bitch.
I don't know their real names, but Jeffy K. and Gogo told me we could get a million in ransom.
No way, punk. The deal was ONE horsie, not two. Now answer the question--! You won't like Jiggles when he's angry...
See the look on his face, it means we have stopped clowning around.
Still “No Comment”?
If you act like a five-year-old, we are going to treat you like a five-year-old!
talk here downtown, or we take a ride in the car.
Now, for the last time, stop calling Officer Bozo a clown.
Coney Island ring a bell? How 'bout the flash mob working the balloon animals? Quite the tactical diversion! Give me a break, kid. We know you were in on the hot dog heist. You were made by undercover!
We'll soon be able to tell if you are serious or not.
We're still working on the good cop, bad cop act.
Why didn't you agree to hire Artie for your kid's birthday party? What, you think he doesn't have kids to feed too?
Guess this is making you feel afraid, huh pal? Afraid and kinda helpless. I get that. And maybe even a little angry. Am I right?
The academy didn't prepare me for this...
We know where you've been smuggling the goods.
Ve haff veys of making you talk, schweinehund!
"This is a classroom not a circus!)
Soda? Coffee? Seltzer?
And in our diversion program you get to work with Officer Kelly our special clown-face and twisted balloon instructor.
If you're innocent, then why'd ya run?
You don't want Officer Giggles Dimples to get angry, do you!?
Listen here, bub. That “creepy ass juggalo” has a name. It’s Ronny, and he has feelings too.
Did you, or did you not, try to steal my partner's balloon doggie?
Terrified - mimes too, why do you ask?
Trust me, he’s got as many balloons as you’ve got hot air.
You could soon be looking at long stretch.
You're facing 25 to life. So let's get this straight. Funny how, funny like a clown?
Nobody does " good cop, bad cop anymore".
You think I'm the bad cop? Wait 'til you meet my friend Gacy!
This clown will make balloon animals until you talk!!
Yes, this my first day at this precinct! What the hell does that have to do with where you were at 9:00 last night?
But can a sketch artist do ... this?
Don't make him bring out the lie detector.
The sooner you tell us the truth, the sooner we can all go back to our jobs.
You have the right to remain horrified...
We have plenty more balloons. And colorful make up. And the clown's not going nowhere, no time soon.
Look, you have to work with me here... Twinkles here has no patience for others clowning around.
You'll either talk to me, the good clown, or him, the bad clown, but you'll talk.
Do you or do you not pledge your loyalty?!
When it comes to getting confessions, my partner doesn't clown around.
You'll be singing a different tune when I turn you over to Crazbo the Clown.
And that's when I stopped eating edibles
Excuse my partner, its his first day and he went a little overboard.
"No, he doesn't know how to juggle, and I think you might have something to do with that!
If you don't confess, it will be good cop bad cop.
We have ways of making you smile and you're not going to like them.
He knows when you are lying.
You'd better help us here or else things might get funnier.
Start talking, kid, or Detective Robozo is gonna keep making clever balloon figures.
Tell us where you've stashed the others.
You prefer to talk to a real funny guy?
Either talk to me or I'll let the bozos work on you. Your choice, punk.
Does this balloon dog look like a liar to you? Our clown detail found him weeping under a bush, said you called him an airdog, said he couldn't smell or mark things.
Let's not have any misunderstandings here, young man. Schmidt here is the bad cop. I am the good cop.
You’ve got one last chance, so stop clowning around.
We are trying something new at the department. We call this “bad cop, clown cop.”
Well I'm no Sherlock Holmes but I'm certain ONE of these victims wasn't a Politician
We don't think good cop/bad cop works anymore.
Now we're gonna show YOU some funny business!
How would you like to talk to someone from your end of the spectrum?
I'm done playin' good cop/clown cop! Answer the question or Detective Chuckles will twist you up like a poodle!
I'm the "good cop".
If you find me intimidating, wait until you meet my partner. The puppy is child's play - you don't want to make him build you a balloon tricycle.
Be warned, it's good cop - clown cop time until you confess.
You think you're funny, huh.
Good cop; Glad cop
Your call; you can either deal with the good cop or the bad clown.
We are trying out our new "Good Cop, Bad Cop" routine.
That's all that's left of the last guy who didn't cooperate
Allright, let's go over your story one more time, and this time we want some serious answers.
This is Detective It from our K9 unit.
Don't make me laugh!
How dare you tell my husband his balloon “doesn’t look anything like a dog”
Bad news, bucko. I'm the GOOD cop.
Correct. I am the good cop, and he is the very bad clown.
You don't want to even MEET our bad cop.
Better tell everything you know if you don't want to see the dogie hurt.
He ditched the fruit because he finished your Carmen Miranda warning.
He’s sulking. His car doors won’t fall off.
Fun and games are over.
Trust me, you don't want him driving you downtown in the squad car.
Trust me, you're probably better off choosing 'bad cop'.
If you think we were clowning around before, just wait until you see ...
Fuggedaboutit, Officer Koons here, will twist your description into a 3D perp bulletin.
What he can do with that stuffed dog makes waterboarding a board game.
You'll sit there until "Send in the Clowns" replays often enough in your brain to make you sing.
How many people did you see exiting the car?
New protocol from those clowns in Washington.
If you won't work with me, you're gonna have to deal with clown cop! It's your choice, knucklehead.
This rescue balloon pet was exposed to toxic levels of kimchi.
Confess, or I turn my partner loose on you?
Actually, I'm the good cop, and he's the bad cop.
What makes you think this crime is a laughing matter?
The only way you're getting out here is if you apologize for calling Officer Gigglepants a clown.
No, I'm the good cop - don't make me leave you alone with him...
So, you gonna talk here or do you want Officer Wise to take you to his office?
Well kid, you had better come clean because you won't make a Bozzo out of me!
He's new to "good cop bad cop".
We're clowns with guns. Nice hoody.
This isn't our first rodeo
Look, kid, tell us what we want to know, or my partner will tag you on Facebook!
In this situation, “good cop, bad cop” is a matter of perspective, son.
No, I'm actually the good cop. He always dresses like that.
You had better tell the truth and I’m not clowning around, yet.
Talk or my partner here fills you with wonderment.
We can’t have two class clowns!
He didn't think working two jobs would be a problem.
Boss! Here's the witness. Detective stop clowning around.
OK, caulrophobe. Choose me or it.
You better talk, because we are sick of working for peanuts.
If you don't confess, the poodle is history.
I'm the good cop. You don't want to deal with Detective Clowny.
If you're feeling too stressed, we now have an emotional support clown on staff.
Cruel “This constitutes cruel and unusual punishment!
Now you wouldn't want Chuckles to turn this nice balloon dog into, shall we say a cat.
I'm the bad cop! He's the funny cop.
I tried working with you son, but now you’ll have to deal the ‘Bad Clown’ instead of the ‘Good Cop’!
We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way...
Try to be thorough in your description, because we are not just looking for any old clown here!
He's the bad cop.
I guess he is the good cop
This is your last chance to confess before I turn you over to the 'Good Cop'.
We tried it the easy way; Detective Wiggled, he's all yours.
Tell us what you know unless you want to see what else our new interrogator, inspector clown, can do with balloon animals.
You think you're funny, wise guy? ... we'll show you funny.
He’ll scare away any school shooters and he works for peanuts.
At least my partner can successfully stage a 12 man getaway.
Don't make me bring in the good cop.
At most police stations, they would call you 'a person of interest,' but here in DC you have to be a true zany to be held over.
Officer Clarabelle knows exactly how to deal with people who won't talk like you.
You don't want to see his giraffe.
Don't think this is gonna be the usual good cop bad cop thing.
Give it up or you’ll never see another birthday
Didn't expect the good cop/clown cop routine, did ya?
You're not cooperating, Steve...So the cameras are off, and it's time for your enema...
Talk or he makes a funny hat.
That's right, smart guy. Bad cop. Bad clown
I asked for my lawyer.
Wipe that smile off your face, scumbag.
Kid, you have two choices. Either answer my questions, or Sparkles the Clown will inflate and twist a very nasty surprise.
You see, Larry, we already know how much you love balloon animals.
Listen pal, my deputy hasn't seen balloon animals this good in 15 years. Unless you can tell us where you found this thing, you have some explaining to do.
Would you like to explain tbis?
Let me introduce you to the other half of the good cop and bad cop duo.
See, I'm in a good mood. I wanna help you. Officer Bobo, now he's in a real bad mood.
It’s something our Community Outreach Dept is trying out
Jenkins here used to be the bad cop until he went for his Master's in Performance Arts.
Yeah, it's the new good cop/bad cop thing. Question is, which is he?
Can you describe what your assailant and his pony looked like? This is Sergeant Chuckles, our police balloon artist.
Either you start talking or the clown starts his mime routine.
Listen, no more clowning around, this interrogation is serious.
You wanna play it that way? Okay, you can talk to the bad cop.
This Doom Cop, Balloon Cop thing won't work on me.
Not serious. Not SERIOUS! What the hell gives you that idea, Williams?
Talk, or he keeps going until he runs out of balloons.
So, you think I’M clowning around, kid?...just wait till you meet my partner!
Talk to me, or I make you talk to the goofy cop!
Now, I've brought in our best balloon artist, so tell me, is this your snake?
Still think this is a laughing matter? Then deal with my partner.
I said poker face, not joker face.
We're trying out a new type of "Good Cop, Bad Cop"
My co-worker told me to go for It...... this was my best impression.
Confess...or we will make this very funny for you!
Yeah...but now we call it "Community Policing Cop, Bad Cop".
You leave me no alternative but to threaten you with torture.
Now You're going to talk to my friend here. Officer Jingles, no funny business, okay?
Listen, I'm not here to debate whether it's good art. Just look at the sketch and tell me again, with a straight face, that you didn't steal Koons' "Balloon Dog."
Just don't try any funny business.
Ya, so I’m the mean guy. You guessed it, huh?
No, I'm the 'good cop'. We're the Pun Police.
You must've gone to school with my lawyer!
You think we're just clowning around...?
"That's right...this is BAD COP AND CREEPY COP" !
I get the reference officer, but honestly I don't care what shape he makes it into as long as he blows it up first.
Why bring Jeff goons into this?
Listen up you coulrophobic scum bag, I;m the good cop!
We have highly trained units, for pranksters like you.
Let me put it this way: Your story has more twists than my partner Bozo's balloon.
Please don't encourage him.
I'm Penn. This is my partner, Teller.
I know what you think---but I'M not clowning around!
Can you not see that neither of them is half as smart as our president?
So, we can make this easy -- or we can introduce you to my partner here, Mr. Balloon Dog.
I'm the bad cop. The good cop couldn't be here, this is his replacement.
Yeah I know, YOU want the ‘Good Cop!
Believe me, you don’t want to be left in here with the ‘good cop’.
I'm not kidding... but he is!
I'm the good cop. He's the bad clown.
stop saying the President did it.
Our sketch artist is out on maternity leave.
Cooperate... or I leave you alone with the clown.
You want to clown around with me? Talk, or you're next!
There's no point in lying, Detective Clown is an expert at solving cases of the giggles.
Now before we start, I want you to wipe that smile off your face!
Listen pal, we can get the truth the easy way.....or Detective Giggle's way. But no matter what, we're going to find who stole the cookie from the cookie jar.
You think I'm tough? Wait till my partner gets a hold of you!
Don't make him make a flower. He doesn't like making flowers.
Don't take me for a fool.
Tell us what we need to know, or he starts doing close up magic.
What are you looking at?? I'm just part time.
Right, talk to me, or it’s the creepy clown your friends posted in the woods behind your house.
Tell me now, my partner is very scary
Let me tell you, he takes the theatricality of playing "good cop" far more seriously than you'd think.
Who farted?
You think your partners care about you? Hell, they've already juggled.
Your twisted alibi just doesn't come together.
You didn’t get my coffee?
Your dad will get here any minute. I want him to know what you did in class yesterday!
Pro Bono lawyer, eh? Meet our Pro Bozo cop!
Brendan, did you see the clown with a dog?
OK smart guy. When I say ‘time to stop clowning around,’ I mean ‘time for YOU to stop clowning around.’
I'll give you one more chance to talk or he'll do mime impressions next!
Despite budget cuts, the Police Department still managed to add to the K9 task force.
What is this? Bad cop, clown cop?
Now I’m only gonna ask you one more time. What happened to the sword?
Own up pal, or you get the squirting flower.
For the last time, Jimmy, did the clown make a Labradoodle like this one or not?
Look, son, I’m the good guy; so work with me.
We're trying to make this easy on ya...and fun
Unless you come clean with me, you'll have to deal with my not-so-friendly partner here.
Enough stonewalling. Quick! Poodle or giraffe?
OK, so opera didn't work, eh?
Okay, fella, you've had all night to come clean. Time to send in the clown.
Either come clean or it's juvenile regression time.
Funny or not funny? And no, your lawyer can’t advise you.
You'll really think it's funny when Officer Chuckles makes an angry Doberman with no leash.
Don't worry --- this is the last audition for "Law and Order: Circus Clown."
'Don't let the 'balloon animal' fool you, Arron.'
Thought I was the bad cop? Well my partner here is a real Joker.
talk to me, kid, before the bad cop muscles in.
...And it was recording your rigged ring toss game the whole time...
Everyone here at the station happens to think Officer O'Hara's Joe Pesci impression is VERY GOOD, Mr. Critical.
To you it's a simple dog balloon, but to me it's evidence.
You must be joking.
The routine in this precinct is good cop, clown cop.
Thats him! Thats the clown that stole my dog!
You rearended the wrong cop car.
So, what'll it be? Confess or one more round of Good Cop/Clown Cop?
We're getting nowhere with the good cop / bad cop routine. Now it's time to introduce "clown cop"! He'll get to the truth. even if it requires seltzer-boarding!
We made you with the clown. Now tell us about the dog.
We work in pairs. I'm the straight man.
Surprisingly, he’s about as accurate as the other sketch artists we’ve had here.
Do you think we're joking around!?
There ain't no nice cop but we have got the next best thing.
Who's the bozo now, kid?
Maybe this will make you break, or at least break up laughing.
Officer Coons will be heading up the balloon animal investigation.
It would help if he would hop on a unicycle.
You better come clean now or I'll turn you over to Detective Emit!
So you've got coulrophobia, I guess that make me "Good Cop."
You called a detective a Sikh clown. Does this look like a Sikh clown to you?
The 'good cop,' 'bad cop' thing wasn't working.
I know my rights, give me my one fun call!
Yes, his trousers are made ot of cheap police-jester, so what?

Ah, I see: that’s why you have that smirk on your face, Detective!
The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
No, I have to warn you, I AM the good cop.
Are you going to talk, or do I need to unleash some clown on you?
He's the "good cop"; which entitles him to blow up balloon animals and dress like a clown.
No doubt about it, that's the guy. I would recognize that animal anywhere.
Ok that's it! No more good cop, bad cop.
Now no more clowning around! Either you confess or you’ll hear the Law and Order “ding ding,” and it’ll be LOUD!

Killer clown turns his life around.
Wanna play good cop/bad cop? Well do ya, punk?
Are you really saying that officer Trumpet can't identify fake evidence when he sees it?
Let's try this again: where is that missing helium? Your story doesn't fly with Detective Sprinkles here, and honestly everything you've said sounds a little ridiculous to me.
Don’t joke with me, pal. We know what you’ve been doing. You do not want to go up against my partner.
Enough with the funny business!
Bad Cop's O.K., but Good Cop could use a little work.
I'm giving you one last chance to come clean before I call in the clowns.

Don't get your hopes up. I may be the bad cop but he's an even worse clown.
It's nothing to laugh at, Punk!
Look, start talking to me... or we'll do it the hard way.
Before you confess, do you have a kid's birthday coming up? Doug needs the money.

Yeah, but you still have to answer the question if he is just clowning around or is giving a detailed explanation of the balloon animal conundrum.
Exactly what time did "some Bozo from the Canine Division" show up?
One more time... How old are you, and how much TV do you watch..?
There is more where that came from if you don't start talking...
Your circus enhanced interrogation techniques will not make me flip.
We will go easy on you if you confess our k-9 picked up the scent of illegal cotton candy in your car.

He’s just getting started. He can twist the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade’s Snoopy into Old Yeller after he’s been bitten.
Focus ! Stop singing " Send in the clowns " .

Kimchi breath while blowing up defenseless balloon animals is against the law!

Oh you probably think us a couple of clowns huh. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Hey common, you know I didn't mean it like that Steve. You know I have a friend who's a clown.
I hope you're good at multi-tasking.
We have your entire FaceBook history and you know what is coming next! So what do you say? let's just skip that and get down to the truth!

We're not clowning around. That's a Tazer he's holding, kid.
Finally, we have a credible witness you stole this from MOMA
We only need to get one of your multiple personalities to confess.
“ Your therapist suggested this may facilitate the interrogation, so this is our best version of Bozo the clown circa 1990’s”.
You want me to believe that you see clowns everywhere?
We can do this either the hard way...or the funny way.
Look! This is serious. We aren't clowns blowing up evidence like it was little doggy balloons?
I have Coulrophobia, clown phobia. I don't want a lawyer, I want a therapist.
You mean to tell me, kid that you don't see Bobo, the baloon jerk behind me?...and you want a job as a security guy?...
Hey! You going to answer my question, Bozo?
And I'm the tears. Get it?

Maybe you want to deal with the bad clown?
So you are the other client of this fixer.

No I am funny cop. He's funny ha-ha cop
You're lucky he's not performing the slapstick routine.
Hey, Mac, the good cop's out today. Now, shut up, and I'll ask the questions.
Why, exactly, would you need a back channel to the strongman, Kyle?
Can you describe what your assailant and his pony looked like? This is Sergeant Chuckles, our police balloon artist.
It's a Laugh Detector Test...fool proof, if you get my drift.
We know you did a porn with a clown ... what do you have to say to that?
You've heard of Good Cop/Bad Cop? Yeah, well we're going to do our version of that now.
I'm warning you, Kid, you're forcing us to play "good cop, bad clown!"
And if you're thinking I'm not serious, young man, you're sadly mistaken . . .
I had a dog once!
The way you tell the story?
Are you playing Good Cop, Bad Cop with me?"
Ok son, No more Mr Funny Guy!!
Sorry, our sketch artist is sick. I hope the guy who mugged you looked like a dog.
First of all I want to put you at ease by saying you are not a "target" of this game
You can work with me on this, or we can do it the hard way.
The class clown isn't always the best to hire.
Listen, Kid. You're in big trouble. And I'm not clowning around!
Once again, what funny business is going on?
Up for a little round of good cop, bad cop?
Look, kid, you better start talking or old Henry over here is gonna twist this thing into whatever he wants.
Detective Bo Bo recognizes this twisted behavior.
...but I bet you’ve never seen Good Cop, Bad Clown in action....

I'm trying to help you avoid finding out how this guy treats you.
since we can't get you to talk,we are going to have so much fun!
really?, did you think this its funny?
And you're saying I'm the clown here?
ah, the old “good cop, bad cop” routine.
You’d better deal with the serious cop—the clown cop’s not that funny.
Better talk now because he's next, and then the mime - and all consistent with the new anti-torture guidelines passed by the City Council.
We'll drop the kid's party theft charge if you tell us how to make a better tail on the giraffe.
Too late now.
So he is your father...
Your alibi's blown.
Sorry about my colleague, he says the rainbow wig helps him think better. I’m not really sure why he’s gotta add the ballon animal and red nose but I can’t judge, i’ve spent the last 42 years looking like every father-in-law you’ve ever had.?
Now Jordon, this is a real class clown!
We're doing good cop, bad clown.
Twister for your hoodie.

All right, funny man. Let's see how you like a taste of your own medicine.
Look, we busted you for smoking a joint, my partner here will tell you just how much serious trouble you're in mister!
You were outwitted by our K-9 unit.
Stop clowning around; one last chance to tell the truth
Here comes the "Good cop, bad clown" tactic.
If that’s all there is, I have to send in the clowns...
Listen, kid. I wanna help ya. My partner can”t always control himself, and he’s packin’ “BANG!”
He's a good cop, a lot of fun, and cleans up after every confession.
"He got that out of the last "tough guy"!
I promise, you don't want me to play good cop.
This is your last chance, Mikey. If you don’t talk to Officer Bobo, we’re going to tell your Mom.
Honestly, I thought you were the clown...
You pick...bad cop, or bad clown.
Confused! So, was he the suspect, or me?
God did it.
Okay Jesse James, the clowning around is over. You’re under arrest.
It's Officer Momo fo you!
The thief is known to appear like a clown. Have you seen him anywhere?

You have the right to remain silent, but he has the professional duty to.
Our undercover agent lost two weeks at the circus to get it
Being Class Clown won't get you anywhere son. Look at your Dad, he's still here.
What makes you think it was an inside job?!!!
OK, good cop/bad cop didn't work.
You had better tell me everything I wanna know because, trust me, he’s not great at parties either.
Make the clown laugh or we’ll go Bozo on you.
No more clowning around. You scared straight yet?
I'm the mean-ass cop and he's the dumb-ass cop...Either way, you don't get the balloon toy.
Better talk or we'll use the laughing gas on ya!
And I’ll became the mime cop unless we start getting some answers.
Now John, my partner here does not clown around. Tell us the truth.
listen to me fuckface Juggaloism is entirely consistent with appreciating Jeff Koons
Was this the guy who stole your birthday cake?
Pete and Repeat are sitting on a fence. Pete falls off. Who’s left? Repeat
You think that's strange? The two-way mirror makes you look disproportionate!
If we're the "good" cops... can you guess how bad are the "bad"ones?
Cooperate or we'll send in the nasty clown.
Enough of this serious cop-silly cop!
If you agree to testify, we’ll have Chuckles reveal how he makes any money getting in and out of tiny cars.
BAD COP, GOOD COP. Do ya feel lucky kid? Your pick.
Admit it. You put a spell on my partner and turned him into a good cop!
Do you still think this is the guy that did it?
He saw you take the girls bunny
Did you or did you not make mimicking gestures of our agent when he was working undercover?
I’m here to report that I found another Bozo working in the mailroom
I told you he can beat you silly.
Clown cop- bad cop

Dad is it you?
After the series closed Rusty was unable to transition away from the character he had played for thirty seasons.

No punk, we aren't trying to good cop, bad clown you.
... ‘fess up tough guy or we’re gonna tickle every bone in your body.
Why, Mr. Koons, why?
Yeah, he's a clown and a cop. And in case you're wondering, good cop/ bad cop, I'm the good cop. So last chance, answer me now or scream for me after 4 hours of his act...
So you say it’s impossible that you're the "Downtown Pick-Pocket Clown"? ….. let’s see how coulrophobic you really are!
If ya think he's clowning, wait'll he sics the mutt on ya!
You see Bozo here will make a puppet out of you if you don't cooperate
Work with this officer to get a rendering of the assailant.
Quit clowning around and answer the question!
What kind of a monster would steal a kid's balloon animal?
No more clowning around, Mr. Z. It's time you got serious on data privacy.
Be aware, if you don’t confess with the “good cop-bad cop” routine, it’ll get tougher.
If you don't talk now you're gonna find out what else he does with a balloon! (The old "Good Cop - Bad Clown Cop" routine?)
Oh yeah, I'll show you a clown!
You think we're clowning around right now mister?
Just confess, did you or did you not purposefully skate board over a clown's pet balloon while at the county fair?
Some say it's the most gruesome torture ever devised. We'll see how you hold up, but my money's on Captain Chuckles.
OK. To show you the seriousness of your crime, Sgt. Chuckles is going to do his comedy act--until you remember how the guppies got into Mrs. Smith's chowder.
It’s time for the ol’ bad cop/clown cop routine.
We're from the government and we're here to help...remember that? Ha, ha. Where're the brown kids? We're here for a travel game. ICE is funny, see. Ha, ha!
He's not lying, this floats too.
Tell me Jeff, WHERE'S THE SHOES?
He helps us keep up with the twists and turns of testimony.
Drop your trousers, sir. Our customs dog can sniff out a mule a mile away.
This interrogation has been difficult. Therefore, we have flown in our Chief Los Angeles Psychiatric Investigator, Mr. Larry.
No, dirtbag -- I'm the GOOD cop!
No, that's not the principal; it's your future if things don't change.
Admit that you intentionally scared our K-9 unit
Oh so just because he's a clown he planted that dog at the scene? I'll have you know he doesn't even DO balloon animals.
FUNNY UNFUNNY
Oh, so you think I'm funny? That's good. You want funny? I got your funny right here.
Believe me, it’s ME who is the good cop.
You won’t think it’s funny when I turn you over to officer Koons.
Face it kid, if the squeaky balloon animals won't make you talk, the seltzer down your pants will.
How dare he steal my balloon!
We found all the balloon animals and their outfits. Youre going to need a good lawyer kid.
Stop clowning around and tell us who the perp is.
This is no good cop, bad cop routine.
Tell us where the birthday party is or the doggie gets it.
Take a look at this clown.
A man. A clown. A dog. It's breakthrough!! It'll set next season on it's ear!
We seem to have a failure to communicate so that's why Doofus the Clown will takes over.
Okay, we're through fooling around! Tell us where you hid the floppy shoes!
Go on: admit you stole the dog from Jeff Koons
No more "Good cop, bad cop!"
Just tell us what we want to know, and then we'll all have a good laugh.
Stupid autocorrect. I said "make a dramatic entrance as a bad COP!"
Who'dja expect A good cop?
I’m the bad cop and he’s the evil clown.
He's the crying on the inside type.
Oh, I get it. The old good cop, clown cop routine.
Officer, is this one of the clowns you said you work with?
I don't get it.
'You're gonna get popped for this, one way or another, bozo. Where are the puppies?"
Well, we couldn't get a suit on death or public speaking.
Don't be fooled, I'm the good guy.
Tell us the truth, or we will tickle your funny bone!
Yeah, we’ll what do YOU do to maximize your potential?!
Good cop bad cop?? This is 2018 buddy!
There’ll be more where that came from once you start answering some questions.
And if you don’t start talking he can mime all night.
You think I’m some kind of Bozo?
That's not what I meant. You're twisting my words around
You better come clean with me. I’m not clowning around.
So the arrestee is thinking to himself ... "I know police departments are being encouraged to make an effort to better connect with ordinary citizens ... but a cop dressed up as a clown with a balloon in hand shaped like Fido isn't working for me!"
Only you can keep him from popping it; where's the body?
That's right punk. It's the bad cop, bad clown routine.
Guess again--I'm the good cop.
You think your so smart, son, but you didn't even realize Rollo over there was an under cover clown.
Are you SURE it's not "good cop, clown cop"?
White privilege aside, you'll be charged as an adult.
We call this type of interrogation good clown, bad clown.
The choice is yours, punk. Bad cop or scary cop?
Never thought we'd need an undercover cop at a kid's party.
Pay attention in class and this can be your future.
Is this the man that interrupted your party?
This is IT! Confess or face the consequences.
What do you know about Jeff Koons and his ties to Pootin the Poodle?
Cool it! That's my balloon toy. You get one if you confess.
So you're not gonna talk, huh? Well neither does Detective McDonald!
"You fit the description given by a five year old. Now, are you going to confess or not?" " I want my lawyer"...
Let's get serious now.
If that didn't help, maybe some Nirvana played on the kazoo will jog your memory!
Confess or be eaten!
Okay, wise guy, you play 'good cop'.
Do you remember seeing this as a child in Toys 'R' Us?
Watch it buddy. My partner here prefers non-gendered pronouns.
You think that's funny?
Rex from the K-9 Corps probably didn’t think Bobo could do it either. Talk, or it’s your turn, pal.
Lt. Dever's tracing techniques are evolving nicely
The killer's methods seem to have evolved.
Now we're going to play a little good cop/clown cop.
If you're going to lie about doing the assignment, say that your dog ate your homework; don't *make* a dog for your homework.
Come clean, punk - don't make him bring out the joy buzzer!
Okay, can you confess so my partner and I can go on with our other day job.
Unless you tell us what we need to know, the possum will be next
Don't get comfortable.I'm the good guy.
It's time you started taking both of us seriously, not just him.
Zuck, cooperate with me or that clown from the House.
No more funny business, pal. It's time to talk.
Don't make me play 'Good cop, bad clown' with you.
What's it going to be, clown? My way or the hard way?
This isn't the time to clown around!
Although Jerry always thought the legal justice system was a joke, he was certain of it after having been treated to a show featuring balloon animals made by a cop dressed in clown gear named Clem.
Bring in the Kansas State Board of Education for questioning.

Yeah? And you think I'M the Bad Cop!!

He’s lucky I didn’t rear end him.
If chivalry is dead, then why am I still holding the door?
A Citation? Is it for bravery?
I have slayed the wagon.
I only glanced down at my phone for a second.
In my defense, I spotted the parking place first.
A ticket?  Surely you joust.
I believe it was a Charger or possibly a Lancer ...
Couldn't find a dragon so I slew an Impala.
Your perps are in a three door sedan.
Verily, twas I, tilting in my lane, when yon jackass opened his door.
Veni, Vidi, Vici, Volvo
It's Quixote, with an X.
I saw the Trump 2020 sticker and just went medieval on him.
On the contrary sir, methinks my opponent did not yield.
It got away, but it's wounded.
Do I look like someone who has a license and registration?
I left a note on the windshield.
Master of misdirection, Sir Lancelot was confident the Officer wouldn't notice the tablecloth he had stolen from an Italian Restaurant
I can't help it if that guy has poor knight vision!
I was told my foe would be riding a Mustang.  Who knew?!?
Yes, but just a couple of meads, probably over an hour ago
It isn't my fault they put the car before the horse.
I’m sorry sir.  I lance a lot.
A ticket for this? Surely you joust.
Prithee, where might I find this "Knight Court" of which you speak?
Did I win??
When you have a lance, everything looks like a dragon.
It's the door prize
The rest of it got away"
Yes. You’re right. I could have used a coat hanger.
He flipped me off and said “F * * * you and the horse you rode in on.” I don't remember what happened after that.
I have vanquished Vlad the Impala.
Lancer. Dodge Lancer.
Dodge Charger. Honest mistake, officer.
He pointed and yelled "picador", so I did
In the wrong place at the wrong time ?
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step out of your time period.
And thus ends the reign of the Two-doors
In my defense I must say that I managed to free the beautiful lady that this monster swallowed
I was left no choice - clearly it had ingested four humans.
Sir, please roll down your window while I talk to you.
I win, and I'm the one getting a ticket?
...so then I said, "I'll show you horse power!"
You'll have to resolve this in Knight court.
I thought equestrians always had the right of way.
White knight takes driver’s door. Your move.
It's almost impossible to catch a cab these days.
Every time he sees a mustang.
I tried to open the door for her, but apparently Chevrolet is dead.
They pay me $20 an hour to ride ahead of them in the bike lane.
I'd say look for a white three door sedan.
A fine? But surely you joust?
Show me the municipal code that prohibits lancing a vehicle.  Go ahead, I'll wait.
He asked me to help charge his battery and I missed.
You're looking at a knight in jail.
Sir Elon Musk dared me to do it and said it could withstand anything.
I have poor knight vision.
No, I wasn't texting.
An assailant, sent, no doubt, by my enemies in the House of Two-Door.
I guess objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.
It said Dodge Charger , neither was accurate.
I hope thy ticket is for the knave who opened his door into the bike lane without looking.
The date of my last vision test? Around 1379.
Elon assured me it would bounce right off.
But officer, he did not yield!
I took an oath to protect the Crown Victoria.
It got away but I definitely wounded it.
No officer, I was not texting.
Are you sure I match the driver's description?
There's a reason we aren't named The Knights of the Roundabout.
Sir, I need to see your license, signet ring and coat of arms.
Canst thou directeth me to the Department of Moat or Vehicles?
It was Chevalier versus Chevrolet, and victory was mine!
That's why they call me Lance-a-lot.
No, officer, I can’t roll down the window.
He laughed at my horsepower.
Farmers Insurance: 
We know a thing or two because we've seen a thing or two.
But how can you charge me if you have no horse?
No, I don't know how fast I was going.
He cut me off. I ran him through.
Behold, I dodged the Charger!
A chivalrous man always opens the door for a lady.
She opened it right into the horse lane
I see your point but I still gotta give you a ticket.
What do you mean I "fit a description" ?
Chivalry may not be dead, but that Chevrolet is.
Are you almost finished your drawing officer? This is really heavy.
It was a Tudor sedan.
I saw it was a Charger, and couldn't help myself.
Roll down the window, please.
If you can't believe your eyes,how can you give me a ticket?
No idea what it was, but I clipped off one of its wings.
No, I don't know why you stopped me.
Sorry, officer. I would roll down the window if I could.
Where I’m from, we pass on the right
I'm being framed officer. If, in fact, I had hit the car, then my lance would have entered from the exterior side, and not from the interior side, as illustrated.
Tudor no more !
Elon from Musk claimeth twas indestructible..
He opened it right into the horse lane, without even looking!
I know how it looks, but really, he never signaled!
I’m going to have to ask you to roll down your window, sir.
I'd rather be tilting at windmills, but you know how the fossil fuel lobby is.
A better question would be what is a car doing on a jousting course?
Well, yes, just a couple of meads.
I thought he said lance a lot.
It was parked right in front of my drawbridge.
With this wound, it can’t have gone far!
Not another steeding ticket
It's out there some where, officer, alive , wounded, and dangerous.
What appears to be the problem, officer?
Relax, officer. I’m holding the door for a lady.
I was looking for a windmill
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to roll down your window.
And it'll keep happening until the jousting community finally gets a dedicated lane of its own.
I don't care that you lanced a car...I'm writing you up because your horse stole a tablecloth from an Italian restaurant.
He gaveth me thee finger.
Lance a lot?
Apparently, I impaled an impala.
I winged it. You'll find it limping up the 
West Side Highway.
It was an Edsel, officer.  It needed to be done.
But I won!
What chance had I? One horse against 300?
...and then he sayeth, “I saw the space first.”, which was a falsehood.
My good sir, a knight does not hit and run. We pierce and gallop.
You’re mistaken, officer; I was not texting, whatever that is.
Well, I guess the pen really is mightier than the sword!
I thought it said "Impale," not "Impala."
Are you seriously not even a little impressed?
I highly doubt there's actually a law against this.
And with nary a glance, his driver's side door swungeth open....
Officer, it was self-defense. The Mustang charged at me first.
This is a fake witch hunt, a hoax, a disgrace to our country, it's treason. Oh, sorry, wrong cartoon.
I guess you can call it a middle age crisis.
And what, make HER open it? Chivalry is not dead yet, officer.
Yes, sir, Knight vision was an issue.
Description? Forsooth, methinks it was a Dodge Charger.
Some wiseguy parked his coupe de ville too close to my coup de grâce.
They didn’t yield.
This IS my turn signal!
Trust me, officer. He won't park there again.
Since when is it illegal to open a door for a lady?
Sir, please roll your window down."
It was a hit and run.  Ironically, by a Plymouth Valiant.
It was a silver Mustang, officer. I got confused.
My opponent, Sir, is now a ‘one-door,’ not a Tudor!
The lance proved mightier than the LeSabre
Roll down the window, sir.
I hath slayed the Uber for taxi drivers everywhere!
If possible, I would like to request King Arthur’s Traffic Court.
Tudor?  It looks more like a four-door, my good sir.
Then why doth his sticker say, 'I brake for animals'?
I wouldn't say I lance a LOT.
I am Don Quixote. Aka The Man of La Mazda.
It said right on the vehicle “Charger” so I went for it
Officer, you should have seen the OTHER car door.
In order to join the Roundtable I was told to kill a Gremlin.
I don't know who "thee" is but "thou" is under arrest.
Are you kidding me? It was a Dodge Charger!
I swear my GPS said "turn, fight."
But officer, he cut me off!
He shouldn't have opened his door into the horse lane.
Seriously, who parks in the jousting lane?
That's Quixote, with a "Q".
It Was Not vehicular homicide!  It was self defense.
She said she needed help opening her car door!
Apparently not an armored car.
A ticket, officer? Surely you joust!
The exhaust-spewing wagon has been slain!"
I will bet he never opens his door in traffic again.
Did you see the Pinto he was driving?  I did him a favor.
Whadja expect . . . they don't call me Lancealittle
Writing me up for this? Surely you joust.
I had one goblet of mead a few hours ago. That's it.
No, officer, not jesting, jousting.
It honked and charged. I accepted the challenge.
75 bucks? Totally worth it.
There's a perfectly implausible explanation Officer.
We just have to wait for The New Yorker to decide which one.
This is for all the bicyclists who've had car doors opened in front of them.
I got the door for her. The polite response would have been 'Thank you.'
I ride in the service of Greta Thunberg.
Now this “court” you speak of...shall I be knighted there?
Okay, so there's an interesting story how I pierced it from the inside.
He yieldeth not.
I'm caught him going 2019 in a 1619 zone.
They were parking in the jousting lane.
He cutteth me off
No thank you, sir. It is my duty to serve the kingdom, not to seek citations.
Fie on your summons, squire, for I am a free lancer.
Totally worth it! I never got one from the inside before.
Officer, I’m confused. You say “Hit and Run” like it’s a bad thing.
If not for your insipid helmet laws I might have seen it.
Who brings a car to a Renaissance Fair?
I was told to get the door.
Perhaps I would have been better off choosing Door Number 2?
He got out for a closer look at the joust.
It's wounded, so it didn't get very far.
My charger hates Mustangs.
I had maybe two meads
Elon said it wouldn't break.
This ensures that its now  a Handicapped vehicle in a Handicapped parking spot.
I guess this is why you don't put the car in front of the horse.
“The Mustang was in my lane.”
My license plate number is VI II V ...
Le Lance is mightier than LeSabre!
We were jousting for a spot and I won.
Sorry officer, I have terrible knight vision.
Why he was in the tournament in the first place, I have no idea.
Is that Don or Donald, Mr. Quixote?
I have slain the carbon-dioxide-breathing dragon.
I take my crossing-guard duties seriously, officer.
I presume this is your first time in a Target parking lot on Black Friday.
Well, he shouldn’t have opened his door into the jousting lane.
He gave me the finger. I gave him the lance.
The door I can explain. It was open in a bike lane. The horse, lance and suit of armor are more complicated.
It is I, sir, the Thane of car door.
What makes you think I hit a car, officer?
I never Dodge a Lancer.
I freed a young maiden trapped in a Beetle.
Impala door? I thought you said Impale a door!
As protector of the bike lane, I offer you this.
Forsooth!  Perchance I misunderstood  "Black Friday Doorbuster.
Let me go get the windshield so you'll have a place to leave the ticket.
A ticket???  I'm not the one missing a side view mirror.
But, Constable, he swerved into my era.
"It is I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mazda!
At least I got one of its ears"
If this is a law passed after 1429, I don’t follow it.
It was driving on its own, as if by witchcraft.
In my defense, I had the right of way.
It used to be chivalrous to open doors for people.
Forsooth, I was told I could impale anything on Fifth Avenue and not get arrested!
It was a close call, but in the end, I just had more horse power.
He was in the horse's blindspot
Good constable, I contend otherwise. The coachman recklessly exited his horseless carriage, whereas I was unable to whoa my steed forthwith.
I wounded the dragon, but it escaped with the poor fellow it had eaten!
...then the great beast spread its wings and bellowed like a monster goose.  I dispatched it!
Isn't this a stand-your-ground state?
Here, I'll hold it up for you so you can read the vin number.
It was more like a run and hit
Sorry...I don’t use this lance a lot.
To be fair, it was an ugly car to begin with...
I only had one mead and that was several hours ago.
No more driving by knight.
Another Uber double parked. Write it up.
We handle illegal parking a little differently.
On the bright side, I think this means I won
Yes, I was texting.
I'd be happy to roll down the window Officer, just finding it a bit difficult to reach the handle.
I’ll take the fine. It sure beats banishment, mutation, hanging, or burning at the stake.
You give tickets for acts of valor?
That guy's armour was like nothing I'd ever seen before.
I take on all Challengers.
I was galloping right along when this jerk in a taxi opens his door right into the jousting lane!
I know it seems odd, but ask yourself if I could have done this to a Volvo in the 1970s.
Turns out it was just a damsel in distressed jeans.
I was engaged in a fulsome charge, in the jousting lane, when, without checking her blind spot, she opens her door.
I’m not rolling down the window until I see your badge.
For the last time, HE hit ME
I won that parking space fair and square!
I don't know who I hit; his shield seems to lack a coat of arms.
No handheld devices of any kind, you got it?
The sign said 'turnpike on ramp' so I did.
More like a removing violation.
So there I was, minding my own business, riding uptown in the right lane, with my lance safely pointing slightly downward, when all of a sudden and with no warning, some bonehead opens the driver door without looking first.
Should be easy enough to identify the vehicle
I don't think you understand, Cavaliers are my sworn enemy.
I said it was a mistake to film Game of Thrones in New York.
His armor was most unusual.
The fair maiden said she locked her keys in the car. Just what would YOU have done in a situation like that?
It was self defense, m’lord. That Tesla was clearly charging!
I have defeated yet another Challenger.
No, officer, I don't know why you pulled me over.
He has the darndest time with roundabouts.
Yes I'll admit it. I was texting.
I used to ride a bicycle until I got fed up with getting 'doored'.
I jousted and won the door prize.
Officer, he opened his door right into the jousting lane!
Ok officer, well how do YOU propose we protect the bike lanes?
It said dodge charger but I chose to charge anyway.
Shouldn't you be thanking me?  You were obviously trapped in that contraption.
This happens every time I ride in the bike lane.
I thought I heard someone say it's a Tudor. I got confused.
But I saved that bicyclist
Sorry, just a little road rage.
We disagreed over right of way until he got my point.
Let me guess...my taillight is out again?
Chivalry is not dead! I was getting the door for a lady.
”But, it’s common practice for a knight to keep the opponent’s shield!
I yield to no one.
I don’t know sir. That door came out of nowhere.
My bad.
OK, so I'm a knight errant.
Spear me the ticket
...and then it ate a whole family and sped off.....
Best. Office party. Ever.
I plead the V.
Officer - the sign said 'Yield', not 'Surrender'."
"
I was traveling in the bike lane when he opened the door.
I needed a shield, Sir.
Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?
But windmills are so 'old school,' Officer...
I know what you're thinking; how did he impale the car door from the inside?
I did wing the monster but his master remains within.
I did mention the errant part, right?
Scribble away, unchivalrous knave. For the joust affirms that only I am New York’s finest.
Yes, officer, I was jousting fast, but I am the Chevy Impaler.
What's more chivalrous than opening a car door for a lady?
Yes, officer, in the 21st century, I tilt at windshields.
Looking to fill the knights’ quota?
I haven't seen a Plymouth Valiant since 1966.
My bad, I lance a lot.
It wasn’t me.
Sir, roll your window down and step out of your horse.
I don’t lance a lot.
we know a thing or two because we’ve seen a thing or two
Officer, I'm pretty sure it was my opponent who was speeding.
What? I had the right of way.
And it belcheth a noxious smoke that can destroy the world. Take not my word for it, ask thou any climate scientist.
We're supposed to impound the vehicles, not impale them
Officer, it was he who rammed his flimsy shield into my spear.
Let me guess, my headlight is out?
How can you charge with me charging? It's the whole point.
He wouldn't stop riding my tail
But Officer is was a Dodge “Charger”.
Final Score: 

Sword 1
Pen 0
It was a Buick Lesabre.
I won, even with far less horsepower.
Herald! I have slain the carbon beast!
He started it.
I had to defend myself.  It's not my fault that, despite its name, the Charger didn't Dodge.
I used my right arm to signal I was turning
So you didn’t get the license plate?
He should have checked traffic before he opened his door. What if I had been riding my bicycle?
Officer, he doored me.
When did it become illegal to get stuck in traffic?
No, I'm not a Tudor knight, I'm a one-door knight.
Yes Constable, I was galloping down the road, minding my own business, when a parked dragon suddenly spread its wings.    
I have helmet-cam video too.
Does the word "quixotic" mean anything to you?
I've been granted power of a tourney.
Time travel's a bitch, officer.
Chevrolet is not dead.
He came at me with a Dodge Charger.
What can I say?  My opponent was unhinged.
Sorry Officer. Elon said the truck could handle it.
It bore the family crest of Cadillac.
Lance Ito finally nails the guy in the white Bronco.
His Excellency told me to go out and slay a two-door.
We finally won the annual road rage contest
You're seriously charging a lancer with charging a Lancer who was just dodging a Dodge Charger?
He was driving a Charger.
Okay officer, I’ll just get the license plate number next time.
What troubles me is how you managed to do this from inside the car
I swear officer, I only had a couple of meads.
We were hoping people would take the mounted police unit more seriously...
Yes it is from a Tesla. But notice how the glass didn’t break.
It's from a Dodge Charger.
But Elon said it was indestructible.
Why are you giving me a ticket?  I won.
But officer, it was a challenger.
Come to think of it, 'slay the dragon' sounds a lot like 'station wagon'"
It was parked in a 'Knights Only' spot.
I, good sir, am a Knight of the Roundabout!
But sir, chivalry requires that I get the door.
"What we have here, officer, is an anachronism, wrapped in a mystery, inside a Ford Pinto."
I chose lance, he chose cutlass.
My opponent is still on his steed. I just caught a piece of his armor.
It was a Jaguar.
The only influence I'm under is that of the King, sir.
It said Dodge, but it didn’t.
My knight-vision isn't as good as it used to be.
You see, good sir, the occupant's obscene gesture didst arouse my ire.
He called one of us an ass.
I do in fact lance a lot.
I do have a point.
What is thy problem sire? I slayed the vile beast.
...And he was riding the strangest horse I've ever seen.
oops
Well, what did he expect when he opened his door into oncoming traffic?!
There's his vin #.
I thought this was an open carry state
Officer, I was in the jousting lane.
So... is Knight your first name, last name or profession?
Admit it officer, this accident is the stuff of legends.
A citation, officer?  Surely you joust.
So.... the car was EMPTY when you speared it?  Please say 'yes'.
Excuse me sir, I’d like to report a hit and run with a cowardly Mustang.
Where I come from, red means "charge."
You're ticketing me? The idiot opened his door as I was galloping by.'
Want it back?
I'm not giving you a ticket, I just like drawing horses.
Lancelot.
I was well inside the jousting lane.
Can we settle this out of King Arthur's Court?
She was blocking the knight lane
They told me that I won the door prize...
If it makes it any better, I was aiming for the tire.
Verily, it could not seem to decide whether to dodge or ram...
I only looked down for a moment to hit 'send' -
It came off a Cavalier.
It’s from a Plymouth Valiant.
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.
But Officer, he was coming right at me on a Mustang!
M'lady saw the parking space first.
Chivalry is dead. I’m getting ticketed for holding the door.
Dost thou admire the impaled Impala?
'I won the joust against the Duke of Hazard, fair and square.'
And then the door fell on my stick.
Well, then how is it fair that now YOU'RE charging ME?
It was quid pro quo.
We just got a report on a missing car door.  You are a person of interest.
His Mustang was no match for mine.
Merely defending a damsel in the bicycle lane, good sheriff.
He was driving a Challenger
It’s been ages since I’ve seen a hit and gallop.
Someone said hold the door for her, so I did.
Write the ticket of dishonor if you must, goodly gendarme, but notice you the strength of mine arm that bears up this hinged plate of armor unassisted.
Sir, please lower your window.
We were dueling over the parking space.
Tis but a dent.
It said "Lancer" on the side, but was clearly NOT PREPARED FOR BATTLE
I'm just as confused as you are.
Macbeth, Thane of Cawdor. The rest of the caw’s pawked in Hawvawd Yawd.
He proffered a gibe about my vehicle's emissions.
I’m doing parking control for the Renaissance Faire
Can we just chalk it up to the difficulties of knight vision?
No officer, I swear the car ran into my lance.
It’s not my fault he brought a car to a joust!
Knight driving
I vanquished the beast, there is no "fixing' it.
The Taxi Union hired me to slay Uber.
Musk said it could not be pierced!
Evidence.What evidence?
No, Lance-a-lot.  And yes, with hyphens.
Your dragons are faster than ours, still I managed to snag this one on the wing
If you heard the way they honked their horn, you'd have charged too.
How do we make this go away?
No, his door hit my lance!
Driving while impaled? Do you know what this will
do to my insurance
I'd love to know what he'll tell his insurance agent.
Do you have any idea why I pulled you over?
I was the only way to stop him. It was a Tesla on autopilot!
My license and registration? I'm afraid it's in the trunk...
He was tailgating, and it just escalated from there.
Do you mind rolling down your window?
That’s two citations for obsolescence, and one for fouling the sidewalk.
He refused to yield.
I was dreaming the impossible dream.
That's right, while I was leaving knight school.
Cut-eth me off-eth, he did-eth.
It happened right after I put him in autonomous horse mode.
But officer, I was clearly in the jousting lane and had the right of way.
You need to go find yourself a windmill.
There was a Jaguar on the hood coming right at me!
I'm sorry, officer, I thought it was a Mustang.
I was defending myself. It’s a Lancer.
Of course the crash test dummy has been mortally wounded!
'Tis but a scratch.
I never dodge a challenger.
So does this mean my insurance rates will go up?
It said, Dodge Charger. I chose Charge.
I hath accepted my door prize
She opened the door in front of me when I was in full charge. That makes it joustifiable.
There goes my premium.
I take offense when someone tries to show me the door.
I was just wondering the same thing. How did I get this door from the inside?
I believe that open doors in the jousting lane are fair game officer.
I've warned you before, Lance. This just isn't your knight.
It belongs to a Checkered Cab who cut me off.
I’ll pay the fine, as long as I can charge it.
I forgot that you trot on the right here
He thought his Mustang was more powerful than mine.
It was an Uber sir, need I say more?
I just nailed my Medieval Times audition, officer. Would you consider a warning instead of a ticket?
Put away thy citation pad.  I have slayeth the evil sedan illegally parked in the handicap space.
It was just a few goblets with friends.
Officer, before you give me a ticket, you should know that my dad sits at the Round Table.
I got medieval on that taxi.
I LEFT a note.
He clearly put the car before the horse.
He sounded the jousting horn, I could not refuse a challenge.
I bested a Cavalier from the Kingdom of Chevy.
I’ve been telling the mayor for years that we need a jousters-only lane
Hey at least I'm done with windmills.
I think it was a Bronco.
Worthy foes, these Volvos.
I steal from the rich and give to the Porsche.
But in Camelot you can make a right turn on a Red Knight.
What was I supposed to do ... just let him merge into my lane without signalling?
You call it road rage - I call it throwing down the gauntlet.
Don't drink and joust.
Quality Control at Tesla constantly evolves, Sir.
Oh, it's GM. Well, that explains it, because this is only my rubber practice joust . . .
Who's tilting at windshields?
You call this road rage?
His churlish bumper sticker did inflameth my sense of honor.
For the Crown, Victoria!
Good knight to you, sir.  Thanks for showing me the door.
Wait. I get doored and you're writing me the ticket?
Elon claimed it was lance-proof.
I forgot my keys, Officer.
You see, I thought it said “impale,” not “impala.”
I couldn't dodge, so I charged
Sorry, but I didn't get the license plate.
Late for work. Fifth & 23rd. Double parking Uber driver. Do I have to explain further?
Do you mind rolling down your window sir?
Do you have any idea how hard it is to hail a cab in this city?
You should be asking him why he was driving in the jousting lane!
But they were the one texting!
Sirrah, how sayeth thou; "Buddy, you're my first ticket for violation of the space/time continuum"?
I safeguard bike lanes from careless car door openings.
He was riding my horse's arse.
My fault?!? How is it my fault? I had the light!
If I’d been on my bicycle, I’d be the dead one.
I assume I'll see you in court.
That'll buff out.
Yeah, just one lousy horsepower and I blew his doors off...
It was a Mitsubishi Lancer.
Officer, there is no way my insurance expired 600 years ago.
But officer, it was a Jaguar.
I said, "You call that a shield?  I think not."
With all due respect, officer, you are citing the wrong Mustang.
How much do you think we'll get paid to be in this Allstate insurance commercial?
Last name? Lance a lot.
Well, no windmills were in the vicinity, so . . .
It's the last time that Yellow cabbie says we Checkers always run late...
Joust and run?
We had both blinkers on.
No worries officer, I have full coverage"
Oh come on, like you've never made this mistake before?!
Yes, officer, I am Sir Lance-a-Lot.
Listen officer! This could have happened to anyone!
It was OJ’s Bronco.
Fair duel officer.
The foul vehicle turneth with no signal.
I thought it was an armored car.
It’s his fault.  He said his Tesla was charging.
You say Chevrolet, I say Chivalry
Officer, you're just not gonna' believe how this happened.
Did I not possess the droit-of-way?
The license plate would’ve been more helpful
I was forced to defend my honor when he displayed his middle finger.
Didn’t someone shout, “Pick-a-door?”
Where I come from we ride and drive on the LEFT.
I had to. It was a Dodge Charger
Perhaps I misunderstood. I thought they said ‘varlet’ parking.
I figured he wanted to joust since he was riding a mustang.
What did it look like?  Well to start with, it's a three door.
Plymouth Valiant was a formidable opponent.
The light was definitely yellow.
I'd say 5'6", white, maybe... 3000 pounds?
But officer, I have defeated the 200-horsepower.
Show me where it says it’s illegal.
I had the light.
It got away but I wounded it.
She said, a true knight always opens the car door for a lady.
It's not your first hit and run, is it?
They should have parked in the Renaissance Festival Parking Lot
No sir, I don't have any weapons.
It was like this when I got here.
I lanced an oxymoron. It was a Dodge Ram Charger.
I was aiming for the drivers hamburger...
But at the last minute he hit a pothole...
Then I said, "Sally, I think you better slow your Mustang down!"
Thy knave parked in my employee of the month spot.
I won this in fair combat against a heavily armed opponent.
I had the light, officer.
Knight 1, Uber 0
But officer, Elon said it was lance-proof!
Never bring a Tesla to a lance fight
It's much safer than cycling.
I’m going to let you off with a warning this time.
At least I didn't run through the stop sign.
Yeah, fine, squad cars are better... I'll go change back into my uniform.
T’was all in good fun, Constable — merry marketing with Sir Elon of Musk.
I thought you were going for the Coup de Grace, not the Coup de Ville...
We had different conceptions of horse-power
"But I was told I'd have the afternoon to poke around the city!
Is signaling a left turn too much to ask?
Hey,bub,that'll be $80 for tilting at windshields!
Do you not open doors for your women anymore?
What do you mean it's not Impala season?
Yep, you nailed it. 1974 Chevy Impale-a.
Tis for my fair meter maiden.
There is NO way there is a law against this...
The fair maiden asked for me to get her door
AW, c'mon .. it's joust a door.
So, this isn't what you call a shish cab-ob?
Tesla said it was joust-proof.
Tesla said it was indestructable!
This Mustang was no match for my gallant steed.
Its not my fault Mitsubishi put forward an inferior Lancer.
Do you have to start a crusade over this?
Mustang? No, it was definitely a dragon.
And I maintain that at a four-way stop a knight always has the right of way.
I’m sorry officer, but I can’t roll down the widow.
Sorry, but I've always hated Plymouth Valiants.
Oops! First day working Valet Service at "Medieval Times".
The bicycle couriers will happily pay my fines.
How about I give you a free door and we pretend like this never happened.
It was a Challenger.
Officer, I was just signaling a turn!
He had it coming, officer.
I told him that if he dared to park in my spot again, I’d get medieval on his car.
A piece of the offending vehicle, my liege.
There I was, minding my own business charging down 5th Avenue in the jousting lane, and this guy that was parked just suddenly opened the door without looking. I could've been seriously hurt!
Tesla's going to want to tweak their AutoJousting feature.
Now, joust a minute officer.
I was in the wrong place, in the wrong time!
His name was Chevrolet, my lord.
He thought it'd be a disadvantage to only have one horsepower.
After all, its name was Dodge Challenger.
Officer, I believe I got my point across!
Yeah, whatever, but I did win right?
She saw a carrot in the cup holder.
It happened at Medieval Times Square.
I know... that's reckless impalement, and jousting while impaired.
I don't have the registration. It's a rental.
Through my visor, noble sir, I read not 'car lot' but 'Camelot'.
I'm just a Middle Aged road warrior, officer.
And don't call me 'Shirley'...
Horseman 1, Horseless Carriage 0
Do you have any idea how fast you were going?
In my defense, he opened the door into the horse lane
I had no choice. The monster was eating citizens.
This was my quest: to follow that car.
And I say to you Sir, will this not teacheth he who looketh not in the side view mirror!
My good man, how was I to know that "Fighting for a parking spot" was just an expression?
Yes. I won the door prize at the latest jousting games.
But officer, my opponent was riding a Mustang
Chivalry really is dead. You get the door for a lady and she calls the cops!
It's not what you think, officer. Just another failed test of the Tesla Cybertruck armor.
Well, Officer, I was at this Renaissance Faire, and this Edsel was coming right at me, it was all I could do to avoid that hideous front grill.
I had no choice. It attacked me out of a herd of them on the 405.
I think you'll be able to find him, officer, it's a late model sedan with one door missing.
If only Dulcinea could see me now.
I locked myself out.
It was joust an accident.
So, what gave me away?"
He said, “Duel airbags.”
In my defense, it was knight time.
The guy was double-parked.
'Twas the Charger ridden by my foe
Your hamlet is safe from the mighty Firebird of Pontiac good sir.”
This is why you don't open doors in the joust lane.
Citizen’s arrest, Sire.
Obviously, sir, a clear cut case of obstruction of joustice
Don’t worry, my insurance provider will be here in a fortnight
I only glanced down for a fraction of a second to put quill to parchment.
But sir, the Mitsubishi Lancer was coming straight at me
But officer, it was a Charger.
I'm more accurate with a Narwal Tusk.
I just tried to give the guy directions
I always fight for the passenger's side
Would you have let me off with a warning if I were a black knight?
Quite simply, we are tired of Uber taking our customers.
It all started with an argument over horsepower.
I thought I'd take a stab at it.
I’d like to report a hit and run.
My quest is to avenge the urban bicyclist.
Well, it looked like a dragon to me.
Your tail-light is out.
First, it was not a hit and run. It was a hit and gallop.
The GPS said make a hard right turn...
YEP!  Pulled right out in front of me!
With Real horsepower I defeated the Dodge Challenger
Woe to him who suddenly opens his car door into the bicycling/jousting lane!
But officer, the other driver changed centuries without signaling.
I had the right-of-way, Officer!
What’s a Matador?
Never mind 'the fair lady's token', you gotta pay the toll.
He didn't use his blinker.
show me the law that prohibits it!
It happens each time I activate the turn signal.
Officer, he claimed to have more horsepower.
He tried to park in my spot.
Is it really road rage or just an act of valor?
I thought because it was a Dodge Lancer it would dodge my lance.
I did not get his license plate.
Sorry officer, it's my middle ages crisis
I'll bet this never happens to St. George.
Yon Plymouth was valiant in defeat.
I guess we both may have been a "Little Cavalier"
I didn’t realize there were fermented oats in his feed bag until it was too late, officer”.
Anachronisms are a crime where I come from
Surely you joust, sire.
I know it's irregular, Officer, but the code of honor clearly states that I should get the door for m’lady.
’Twas then he sounded the horn of commencement.
I warned him that if he cut me off I’d have to go medieval on him.
I saw an opening and took it.
Make haste, good sir. The iron dragon hath only been shorn of his scales.
Thus didith I slay the Uber!
Surely you joust.
I joust had one glass of wine with dinner Officer.
Elon Musk said it was indestructible!
Thou shalt ticket me not"
Self defense, officer.
To be fair, it was a Cavalier.
Apologies, kind sir, but I have poor knight vision.
Do you know how fast you were going?
In my defense, sir officer, you Yanks do ride on the wrong side of the road
Looks like road rage got the best of me again.
American cars still can’t compete
They opened it just as I was passing.
I'm on a quest for the owner!
Officer, I didn't realize I was in the bicycle lane. I don't even know what a bicycle is.
But officer, it was a doorbuster sale.
He was in the drive through lane.
I know - my fault entirely. I should have used the blinkers.
If it makes you feel better, it still has one more wing.
How was I to know the dope would open his door?
It’s the only one missing a driver’s side door.
Methinks I have defeated the dragon in fair combat.
Because road rage is no excuse for unchivalrous behavior.
No freelancing allowed!
I jousted my Jetta in jest.
I left a parchment slip on the dashboard, officer.
We both said “charge” but apparently they had an electric car.
What law have I broken?
He has an affinity for other Mustangs.
I  believe it belongs to Sir Doubleparksalot
Don Quixote meets Elon Musk
...and then I thought “I’ll show her which one of us is more chivalrous!”
Yellow Cab threw down the gauntlet to Checker Cab, and this is our response.
Why can't you just yell "Taxi!" like everybody else?
Just doing my part against imports.
He should have known he was parked in the jousting lane.
I just can't stand people texting while driving.
He hath violated the bike lane.
Good sheriff I have slayne the beast.
You're charging me with hit and gallop?
Perhaps you could just redirect me to Medieval Times and we can put this little silliness behind us.
Write me up if you must, but he failed to signal
You tell me what it is, Officer.
And THAT is when the bicyclist escaped.
He opened his door into the tournament lane.
The windmill incident wasn't enough?
Well I can't really give a turn signal, can I?
Its not stolen property, I won fair and square.
I just had to see for myself.  Bullet-proof perhaps, lance-proof not so much!
That guy was double parked in the horse lane, and I get the ticket?
It arrived in the 14th century out of context.
What, you've never seen a door kabob?
I may have had a mead or two, why?
'Sir Lance a lot.' Good one. I haven't heard that in at least 30 minutes."
This would be a non-issue if there were more knight lanes.
I locked my keys inside.
It's my first Impala. Now I need to get a Cougar.
It was pea green, my lord.  I mistook it for a dragon.
Next time, please limit these demonstrations to your own vehicle Mr. Musk.
Sorry Officer; I left my license and registration in my other suit.
Knight to Buick's left rear door. Check.
"Honest, Officer. I left my driver's license on my other horse."
So...use your dash Camelot?
Windmills aren't what they used to be.
I had no choice.  It was a BMW.
I had him in my sight then the time machine kicked in and I'm on 5th Avenue.  What is this thing?
Et tu, Tesla?
Officer, the Charger pulled out in front of me!
Officer, In my defense; the taxi charged me first.
Not his, but mine, was the better mustang.
I assume you carry collision
He opened the door into traffic and I could not stop on time.
No it's not a Pierce Arrow. Look more carefully.
Well, there aren’t any windmills in Manhattan.
I said 'questing', not 'texting'"
I slayed thee mighty steel dragon with my sword and hold one of its wings to prove it!
Connecticut?"
"Yup.
Strange beast... when I pierced it, it sped away, and smoke erupted from its posterior...
Sure pal, but you still gotta trot on down to City Hall to apply for a medallion.
You have your knight stick, and I have mine.
Chevrolet?! I swear he said chevalier!
The other fellow had a Mustang. Or, maybe a Bronco.
My opponent has a most impressive steed.
(shivery is not dead)"The lady asked me to hold the door for her."
He cutteth me off, sire, and I don't stand for such malarkey.
Yeah, but he was driving with his headlights off at knight.
Sir, it was a '74 Javelin coming right at me !
I'm writing a think piece for The Medieval Times
But he opened it on a fair maiden in the bike lane.
He doth turn right on red without signalling and stopping first.
'Twas a Mustang of uncommon horse power.
The revolting knight known in this realm as the Pontiac Aztek shall no longer terrorize your poor inhabitants sir!
'Twas I who killed the electric car, my liege.
That’s right officer, no side mirror.
And then I said “Alexa, teach me to dance.”
Prithee, sire, I have never beheld a knave with such a thick suit of armour.
So that’s gonna be 1 point for the tournament, but 3 points on you license.
Officer, I just rescued a lady from one of those rideshare cars.
I hail kings, not cabs.
I'm not quite sure how I got the lance inside the car, either.
He was probably texting.
Sorry, but it was a Javelin.
That’s what happens when you bring a Mustang to a Renaissance festival.”
Blameth me not for thy shoddy armor.
I have to ticket you for driving with Knight Blindness
Sorry officer, I really am a knight errant.....
Sir, I won't ask again. Put the weapon down and open the door.
We wanted to see who had better horsepower
But officer, I let him in and he did not wave.
...and these motorheads think they own the jousting lane too!
I have slayed the dragon. Here is his odd-looking wing.
I am the Thane of Car Door.
The Knight was Green.
we're a home delivery startup
Sir, can you roll your window down?
"Touche, sir."
1 horse against 120 and I get the ticket?!
Crusades or Carsades, it’s the same difference buddy. In New York City your horse still needs to wear a diaper.
I didn't get the license plate of the knight who cut me off, Sir but I got a piece of his horse.
Yes officer, it was a Dodge Charger.
Sir, vast horsepower differential canst be overwhelmed by superior maneuverability at close quarters.
Joust the facts, sir. All we want are the facts.
Officer, he questioned my steed’s superior horsepower.
I was expecting cavalry not camry.
Sorry officer, the Mustang came at me very quickly, and I panicked.
Sorry, from a distance it looked like a windmill.
You don’t bring a Pinto to a mustang fight.
Verily, I had no choice. The rogue refused to yield!
It shouldn't take long. Just delivering my latest piece of Art to the Moma and I leave.
The bandit escaped, but he won't get far on a wounded mustang.
Well as head waiter, I am required to pursue anyone who leaves without paying their check.
No, there's no problem here officer
And you're saying the car backed into your lance Sir ?
Driving at knight is really dangerous
He turned left from the jousting lane.
But Officer, it was running at me so I just tore off a wing.
I heard that you miss your old Crown Victoria. As you can see, I didn’t.
I'm a trainee.  I thought I'd start with something that wouldn't fight back.
But that Mustang was coming straight at me!
I was aiming for the olive.
A ticket??! Officer,surely you joust.
It was this or yield.
It appears to come from a Charger.
Yes, but I won.
What was I supposed to do? His horse was a Ford Bronco.
Well, I do think you’re missing the point, Officer.
He ran into me, my good man.
A valiant foe, Sire, of mighty roar and many horses.
My Lord, she was a damsel in distress!  Never have I had to chase down such a foul-smelling dragon in any knightly jousts!
How fast was I vanquishing?
But officer, it’s the only way not to get car-doored in the chariot lane
But officer, it was a Pierce Arrow
Whatta Knightmare!
He came at me with a Javelin"
I'm still trying to figure out what that thing it was attached to was...
I thought Sancho said a Volksdragon.
Drivers act like the joust lane just isn’t there.
I'd like you to know in advance: I am armed.
His coupe runneth over.
You wouldn’t know where I parked the rest of it, would you?
Well for starters you were jousting on the wrong side of the road.
He failed to yield.
You will write this down, Officer Sancho Panza, ‘No swerving into my Master’s lane.’
He just came out of nowhere.
...astride a white  Dodge  Charger.
I am one of Vlad the Impounder's interns. How did you know?
Oh, this? It’s nothing. Just a misunderstanding about a parking spot.
It was an extraordinarily well armoured pinto.
It's part of the 2019 Lancer door recall.
Verily, I bested the Knight Rider.
Can't we just call this performance art and I'll be on my way?
It was an Edsel.  It had already died.
Yes, I captured the door of a Nissan. Now I must complete my Quest.
No, I didn't get the license plate.
...an older model Lancer, yes.
He lies. He did not check his rearview mirror because there is no rearview mirror, sirrah!
Some may say road rage, I'd say valor achieved.
Yes, my horse is wearing a tablecloth. officer. Aren't you going to ask me about this car door?
Would it help if I told you I used to be a mounted police officer?
Sorry, Officer. Horse rage.
I know nothing of this term Road Rage you speaketh of.
That’s right officer. He said his armored steed was a Mustang.
The driver really said I was black?
I'm surprised it caught up to the Mustang.
I thought it was my nemesis, the Earl of Buick.
I didn't see a sign telling me not to do it.
Can’t you just take a photo instead? My arm is getting tired.
But Sir! They're getting away!
Sir.  A most heavily armored steed.  I have not encountered its equal.
Thus endeth all hindrance before me.
It was coming toward me, like fast.
Sir(e), in this city you are supposed to "hail" a cab, not "nail" a cab
I don't understand.  What's a car?
No Tudor will get in my way!
What do you mean "does your horse have insurance?"
This wouldn't have happened if my horse didn't like to chase cars.
So I am going up the East River Drive when this sports car tries to zip past me and he gets tangled up with my weapon.
..and then, as it wailed an unearthly scream, it swung its arm at me as I was about to slay the beast"
The lesser-known Sir Lance A. ParkingLot.
Well, it sure beats tilting at windmills...
"I was picking up litter, and look what I got."
I don't know how it happened. You know hard parallel parking can be!
So much for "Objects in your mirror are closer than they appear."
Hey Bob, it's me, Mike. I got bike path patrol today.
But it was dark. The ‘knight rider’ turned out to be an ‘82 Firebird.
I was protecting a checkered cab.
Forsooth, let us all rejoice my bike was in the shop, else this "dooring" might have done me grievous harm.
'Tis but a flesh wound!
Nicely done.  But you charged up a one way street
Just ONE chalice of mead, officer.”
It's OK, I'm insured for this.
But officer, this one will never again bother anyone.
Door-ing!? In my day, we called it door-ing do.
Don't give me a DUI Officer! I can't do the straight walk test because Knights can only move in an "L" shape.
I was in the jousting lane, officer!
What did I win?
I gladly accept your citation for my defeat of the Steel Knight.
Luckily, I’ve got full coverage.
But you just let the guy with the narwhal tusk off with a warning.
But it was double-parked.
I wish to report that chivalry is dead.
You should have heard the air bag go off!
...Well I've never actually seen a dragon before...
I don’t know how it got there...
Don't blame me.  Blame my forward collision sensor.
After a while, one Charger looks much like another.
Officer.  I had the knight-of-way!
But I always win by aiming at their blind spot.
First time to the city
OK, but where do I find a windmill in New York?
It’s not a door, it’s a jar.
I totally had the right of way.
They don’t call me sir lance a lot for nothin’
Sorry Officer, the rest of it got away
I guess a verbal warning is out of the question?
I guess I don't know my own horsepower.
It came out of nowhere! What is it?
On the plus side, I did beat them to the parking spot!
His armor was good but his lance left a lot to be desired.
Again?!
But officer, I had the knight of way!
But the sign on the beast said 'Charger'.
Do you really need to sketch the scene as you saw it?
When he saw the damage he had done to my lance, he jumped back in his car and sped off!
It was a Cavalier.
You’re trying to tell me you won the door prize?
Officer, I hath slain the dreadful Pinto.
Feudal versus Ferrari, Officer, and Feudal wins.
You may note that I have now won.
So is the ticket for me or my trusty steed?
What do you mean, "texting?"
Officer...do you know where I can find the car that belongs to this door?
My vision for safer streets is not universally shared.
I
“I’d say we’re doing pretty well, considering it was just the two of us against 600 horses!”
I would have a license plate if I had the whole car.
"It's part of the Mayor's Congestion Pricing plan."
With all due respect, Sire, I doth not have a blinker.
Officer, the real danger is that the airbag didn’t deploy.
Can you really blame me? It said ‘Lancer’ right on it!
Sorry, I misread what the guy said about his car needing to be charged.
I'm sorry officer, but I go nuts when I see drivers on their cellphones.
When they gave me my lance, your door was already on it.
Yes, Officer. He was driving a Mustang.
Auto Correct.
Vandalism? No sir, this is a car door.
City parking . . . . .you do what you have to do
It must have been a Dodge Lancer. As you can see, it wasn't a lance dodger!
Are you interested in a plea deal, officer, or do I have to stick it to you too?
I’d to report an accident in the space-time continuum.
I was riding along in the horse lane, Officer, minding my own business, when this jerk suddenly opened his door!
Mayhaps they shall signal the next time.
In the long arc of history this thing just appeared out of nowhere.
Now the last checkered cab is gone.
I'm telling you officer, the wreck wasn't my fault, and it wasn't a t-bone ... more of a shish kabob.
Road rage!?! It was purely a defensive maneuver.
Nay! It was yellow when I entered thy intersection
I could let the insult to me pass, but when he started in about the horse I rode in on. . . .
A challenge is a challenge!
In all fairness, my good sir, he changed lanes without blinking.
He got away but I winged him.
Don't worry, it was driverless.
Those tourists from across the pond are always driving on the wrong side of the road.
Dispute thee not my right of way.
Oops, my bad!!
Haven't you ever played chess, Officer? Knights have to move in an "L" shape.
You try putting a taillight on her, officer.
Failure to yield.
I am I Don Quixote the Lord of LaMazda!
All I'm saying is people shouldn't only be looking for bikes when getting out of their car.
But officer, you see, the car was charging.
My full name? It's Lance A. Lot.
You're next if you persist sir.
I guess you've never been a bike messenger...
The varlet was in the left lane forever.
Well, officer, you can call it road rage but I call it asserting my right-of-way.
So you opened the door for The Lady and you haven't seen her since?
He cut me in the Popeye's drive-thru line when I was waiting for a chicken sandwich
Would you consider giving me a warning?
Impaneled!
Tell you what, I will write it up as just a missing taillight.
He lost
I saw Dodge Charger coming at me so I had to defend myself.
A man was being eaten by this thing, so I speared it to save the man.
The guy tried to take my space.
But I was in the jousting lane.
Merlin.  What a jester thou art.
Trial by combat proveth the right of way.
These self-driving cars don't seem advanced to me!
Well, I have a checkered caballero license.
ohhh...you wanted the license plate?
So I swore an oath to protect the bike lanes of this kingdom forevermore.
Forsooth, Officer, I hath won the contest against the Dodge Lancer.
He got away.
The Uber doth mock mine taxi steed.
He should have yield.
Then consider this YOUR warning.
I got the door before it got me.
It had the word “Charger” on the side.
He hates using his blinkers.
But officer, he was mocking us for having only one horsepower
Twas fair sport, constable! Was their car not a Mitsubishi Lancer?
What makes thee think I was illuminating a manuscript as I rode?
Obviously a Challenger.
Riding on the left IS right!
Then that loutish boil  blew a loud horn from his wagon and called us a rolling manure factory.
They obviously don't make armor like they used to!
It's OK officer. It is from a Dodge Charger.
For future reference, below 14th Street jousting, above 14th Street no jousting?
He ranneth the red light.
Well, she’s the one who ran the red light.
Fortunately, I have Farmers.  They've seen a thing or two. <cue jingle>
He’s gotta look before opening into the joust lane!
I speared his shield, but his steed hath carried him away.
It wasn’t a fair match, about 309 horsepower difference
He claimethed more horsepower than I.
The don't make windmills like they used to.
It wasn't my fault.  He didn't use his turn signal.
Will this ticket result in points affecting my insurance rates ?
It's the 2020 model. Lightweight. German steel/titanium alloy. Perfect holiday gift for law enforcement.
Well, I didn’t know you couldn’t do that
I forgot that you drive on the wrong side of the road over here.
I thrust. He parried.
This belongs to the beast who tried to overpass me on my right.
My steed took offense when the Colt challenged him.
Ok, Quixote, off the horse and put it down.
I was charging down my own lane when the door suddenly swung open.
I thought they said I should "impale" a cab!
Is this what you’re looking for?
It was a Dodge Charger, license plate JOUSTME.
Yon cabby sullied my honor!
This shields sucks
I apologize, officer. He gets skittish around other mustangs.
You have quite the cavalier attitude about this all, sir.
He vexed me.
He didn't look before opening his door.
We are the Knights who go "Beep!"
I didn’t know I was in a non-jousting lane.
Was opening me Lady’s door, sire. Am I not alive, and chival?
But sir, you simply do not seem to understand. The headless, metal horse charged at me first.
It's 'Lancelot' with one 't.'
I missed the knight but I disabled his charger.
The Emperor tasked us to create an open door policy
I have slain your dragon of steel sir, what be my reward?
The metal beast would not yield.
Yon fair maiden forgot to disengage the kid locks.
Don't look at me, officer, it's a self-driving horse
Not everyone loves a parade.
Clash not Accident
No, I haven't been drinking tonight. What has you ask?
Sorry officer, I only did it in joust.
Sorry. Officer, my horse made me do it.
What's a car door?
Pray tell, no right on red?
Officer, he opened his door while I was trying to pass.
But he’s the one who swerved into the jousting lane!
Noble Sir, ye may tell tale near and far,
of how I bested the knight of this car.
True to his name my opponent dodged as he charged yet I still winged his armored steed.
But officer... thou shall not open a door into oncomith traffic.
I swear I'll never sally forth in the bike lane again.
I was cantering along, well under the limit, when this idiot mustang opened his door right in front of me.
Sir Uber has been vanquished!
I had to stop him, Officer! He was texting.
I don't know what it is either!
Now do you believe that we need dedicated jousting lanes?
How about if I spear you the explanation?
I'm afraid he escaped.
Is Chevrolet dead?
OK, this time I'll let you go with joust a warning.
Now that you mention it, "fetch me a wild bore" does make more sense."
So then he said, "You call that 'horsepower'?"
Name's Vlad...Vlad the Impala Impaler.
Methinks I lanced your Charger.
Yeah, right. 50 mph? Rocinante?! You read too many books, officer.
We're still working out the kinks on these self-jousting steeds.
Seems like the East Village is overrun by cars these days.
He cut me off.
Horseless carriage. Driver's side. Direct hit. No foul. I win.
My night vision isn't what it used to be.
We were playing Forward vs. Ferrari
What if I told you I'm on my way to save a damsel in distress?
How about ye olde diplomatic immunity?
I pay good money for that space, officer.
Don't worry Officer. Sancho will bring in the body!
It’s OK, officer. I’m just doing quality testing for Elon Musk.
Fair Heart never won Fairlane
He hath cut me off.
In my cultural context, dear Sir, he had it coming.
b b b but Officer, I'm WHITE!
What is this 'bike lane' thou speaketh of?
Trial by combat, not road rage, officer.
He was supposed to yield
I got it in a coupe d'etat.
He was riding a Pinto officer.
I tried to give him my insurance information, but for some reason, he just took off.
The Earl of Chrysler is vanquished.
Officer, this jalopy offended the honor of all five boroughs.
I saw the armored car, and just reacted.
Well at least the air bag didn't go off!
Does this look like a grail to you?
Do you think Aflac covers this?
So you're saying that the lack of jousting regulations on the books does not make it a free-for-all? How is the average knight supposed to know this?
I'm working undercover, officer.  Take this to Forensics.
To be fair, it was a Mitsubishi Lancer
We triumphed with one horsepower.
But squires should yield.
Twas a rental
I impaled the Impala.
What's a car?
Little help?
I said To bring back Robin Hood 
not Falcon Door!!!!!
Officer, it was a hit and run.
This time you ain't gonna dodge the Dodge Charger charge charges.
Explain the horse outfit.
Well, he should have looked before opening his door!
I  joust made a mistake, officer.
As I understand it, officer, a yield sign means "yield or die."
I was joust promoting the Renaissance Fair.
Then suddenly this guy in a Rabbit decides he wants to play chicken.
Assault and battery? This is a door!
Officer he opened his car door without looking.
My horse considered it a dodge.
Sorry, I'll have to check, Mate.
If it wasn't a hit and run, where's the rest of the car?
Sorry. It was a Mustang and I couldn’t resist.
“Yes sir, I lance a lot.”
So, it's not a windmill.
Somewhere in Brooklyn, in a place whose name I don't care to remember.
It was a Dodge Lancer. Are you going to give me a Chevrolet Citation?
I've had it with cars double parked in  joust lanes.
He's the one who failed to yield.
How many points for piercing your armor?
It wasn't my fault officer. He cut me off. Besides, its only a chink in his armor.
To be fair, officer, it refused to yield or even signal.
He was driving at knight.
Sir, I must ticket you for unauthorized time travel and recklessness.”
To be fair, officer, who parks their Camry on the Renaissance Fair tiltyard?
Whats a license and registration?
I was actually tilting at the wind SHIELD.
We stood behind for six green lights and it refused to make a left.
I'm telling you he didn't signal."
Officer, I'm very sorry.  Actually, I was aiming for the window.
It's not my fault, he opened his door into oncoming traffic.
It's okay. It's from a Charger.
Well, until there's a knight lane, I'm gonna use the bike lane...
But I slew the Gremlin!
I'm sorry, Officer. I didn't know the lance was loaded.
I thought it was a dragon, but it was only a Volkswagon!
Looked like a Ram to me.
But they nearly killed me opening their door in the middle of the road.
It was his fault officer, he was texting and ran the red light in front of me.
The keys were locked inside.
I will defend against all Cavaliers.
Could you help me, sir? I don't know what this is.
I care not what you summon!
My steed is named DeLorean, good sir. Why do you ask?
Well officer, I got the point through by not being so blunt.
A court date, mandatory fine, AND loss of lance? Surely you joust, officer!
I sideswiped him, but he ran the red.
But officer, HE was supposed to yield.
Of course I want to press charges! We still have two passes left.
I'm sorry, officer. I have terrible night vision.
Thank God I was wearing my steed-belt
Not my fault--he opened the car door just when I was riding by!
They don't make armor like they used to.
He just opened it right into the jousting lane...
I am of the house of Tudor, we have a thing against the house of Onedoor.
He was using the carpool lane without a passenger.
Why are you writing me a ticket? I had right of way.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
And what, prithee, is a "ticket?"
Do you know why I pulled you over?
Hmmm..improperly impaling a motor vehicle?
No, for driving under the influence of a tablecloth and jousting over the speed limit.
I can’t roll it down.
He moved into the jousting lane without signaling.
That Subaru challenged me officer.
An iron contrivance cut me off.
It was an accident! He joust didn't see me coming
He double parked and boxed me in.  It was a Knightmare!
Door, what door?
Since when has being anachronistic been illegal?
I thought the sign said “Pike Lane”.
I'm strictly a catch-and-release guy.
Why not?  It stole my name!
The name is Lancelot, what about that don’t you get?
So, this is what it's like to be King Arthur in a Connecticut Yankee traffic court.
What car? ‘‘Tis the shield of Sir Galahad.
No, I'm his brother, Lance-some.
Rather than license and registration, I present thee my door prize
Well...Sure, I guess I COULD have just taken down the license number...
But it said it was a Dodge Charger....
I'm just not sure what to cite you for.
Nay sir, I could not get his details. But I did snag this.
Sorry officer I wasn't wearing my knight glasses.
No I swear, he came at me
I impaled the Impala on the way to the palace!"
I meant to turn left coming out of the 12th century.
The oth'r sir ranneth the r'd light!
He didn't dim his brights.
So it fine for Mr. Burr to duel but I can't joust in Weehawken?
It's from a Dodge Lancer
Just two horns of ale in the evening, officer.
He violated the cardinal rule of jousting - staying in your lane.
I'm reducing carbon emissions.
I was just helping a lady out of her carriage.
But he opened it into traffic
Despite its name, it may not rove onto our land.
Never open doors in the bike lane.
Well, I don't know if I can give you a ticket because you're technically not driving a motor vehicle.
I’m sorry about your partner officer.
I get road rage when I seen someone texting and driving.
It's my passion
While you're at it, Officer, would you talk to her about this tablecloth I have to wear everyday?  I'm Arabian, see, not Italian.  Arabian.
I've been ordered to destroy evidence officer, just ask the Pres.
Well,it WAS a Charger,but not a Dodger!
The offending beast refused to yield my good man.
excuse me, officer, that can't be.

this is the passenger side door!
How can a door be 4 points?
We cabbies do not like Uber’s invasion.
It didn't Dodge
Shirley U. Joust is my real name officer.
Yes, but was it missing the front or the back door?
Sorry officer, I can't roll my window down.
I apologize, my wife, Guinevere has the insurance card.
I yield to neither man nor compact SUV.
I was in the joust lane. He opened the car door without looking.
Rook here officer, King cut me off as I was pulling into the Pawn shop. Queen got out and cursed at me. I told him to shut his Bishop. Joust kidding, but can I get the Check,Mate, before it’s Knight?
I'm serious officer. A monster came out of nowhere, and left a piece of its body on my lance.
It was in our blind spot.
He should've looked before opening his door into the jousting lane.
Yes officer, I was wearing my seat belt.
But Officer, I had the green!
I was only going at a fast gallop, officer.
What? It was in the bike lane.
Good sir, I act by King Arthur's fiat.
I heard Lancer!  Who knew it was a Dodge Lancer?
It was called a Dodge Challenger Hellcat.
''There can only be one Knight rider.''
He was driving a Mustang.
Haven't you ever heard of the Society for Anachronistic Vandalism?
It’s ok it’s from a Dodge Charger
I had more horsepower.
Honestly -it was another charger.
I thought alternate side parking was suspended today.
you're still getting a ticket
It was  joustifiable hubercide.
I'm on a Crusade against modernity.
It was a Dodge Charger, if you must know.
He's gettin' up there, so I couldn't have been going more than 20.
That's right, officer, a one-door Mustang.
He took my parking space!
I bested Sir Chevrolet even though he said he had the power of 385 horses."
Why am I being given a ticket? I missed him.
The driver opened the door just as I was trying to pass.
He was texting and drove into my lane.
Well, he opened the door right in front of me!
If I said they were asking for it would you believe me?
As thou canst see, my steed has superior horsepower
It doth came out of nowhere.
I was jousting against a Scion.
And this is why we need a Knight Lane!
I'm tilting at Ubers.
Guilty, officer.  It said 'Dodge Challenger' and I failed.
I showed the road rager the door.
Improper lane change.
Technically I didn't hit it, Officer.
King Donald of the House of White will pardon me for damaging Sir Biden's carriage.
i beat your police car at jousting, loser cop
Wasn’t much of a Lancer after all...
This door won't bother anyone again!
Nonsense: it was a fair duel!
Then why did Mitsubishi name it the "Lancer?"
Officer, I know my selfie stick is unconventional
You're lucky.  We don't have summer uniforms.
Last week it was an Uber bike.
Talk about horsepower.
A Dodge Charger challenged me to a duel.
It said, "Dodge Lancer", but it just wasn't quick enough.
WHERE YOU WEARING YOUR  "KNIGHT VISION GLASSES?
You better get your knight vision checked?
Then he opened the door right into the jousting lane.
This is why we need more jousting lanes in Midtown.
They call me the Kebab in Shining Armor, but my horse responds to Bubba.
Sir Roadster should stay in his lane.
I thought that the "distracted jousting law" wasn't due to go into effect for another six centuries!
‘‘Twas Sir Chevrolet, I believe, but I yield to no man.
I should let you know now, officer, next weekend we're doing the Civil War.
Excuse? Excuse! Fine my opponent for cheating with a mechanical horse.
A Mustang cut us off.
Give me a break.  I have to practice on moving targets.
I don't care if you won the duel.
I have unhorsed you from your metal steed. Relinquish your goods for the day is mine!
I’m telling you, I didn’t even know my tail light was broken!
Officer, I just wanted to make sure Chevrolet is dead.
And that's when I crossed my Rubicon. In this case, a Jeep Rubicon.
Before we get to that, let me tell you of my Quest
Officer, It was not a "Hit and Run' - It was a "Stab and Sprint"
Just a glass of mead with dinner, Officer
With respect, Sir, I don't think that's what Stand Your Ground means.
You can't give me a ticket - I was in the Jousting Lane!
It's OK officer, I have full coverage insurance.
I couldn't help myself, it was a 1971 Javelin trying to pass me on a double yellow line.
This is the door that so rudely opened  and tripped me.
He should have stayed out of the jousting lane.
The lady demanded, I open the door.
Mustang. Is that some kind of mechanical horse?
Can you roll your window down?
You should see the one that got away.
Riding defensively has its rewards.
Do I appear in King Arthur's Court?
As I told you officer, I won the door prize.
How was I supposed to know they weren't using it as a shield?
Honest, officer, I thought it was an armored car.
Yea, yea. Everybody's new in town.
Where shoulds't I claimeth my prize, good sire?
Strange. Beast. I think that's an ear.
T’was self-defense;  the Aggressor charged at US with the power of 300 Horses!
At least I got the guy in the back seat.
I claim self-defense.
...But if I don't deliver it in 30 minutes, it's free!
So I said "whaddya think the side-view mirror is for, buddy?"
Why would I need a ticket to my own show?
This is clearly a moving violation.
sometimes you are forced to remove the competition : you understand, right?
Not my fault!  I stayed in the joust lane!
Good sir, me thinks I had thee right of way.
I USUALLY DON'T HAVE THIS MUCH
LUCK WITH A TWO-DOOR.
It's okay, officer.  We're both Cavalier.
I cannot listen until you say 'hear ye hear ye'
Hast thou not heard of the Dutch Reach?
Impala? I thought it said "Impale!"
Don’t worry,” they said. “The Cybertruck can handle it,” they said
Obviously it was a case of failure-to-yield on his part.
Seriously, it was the biggest 4-wheeled monster ever, and I almost had it!
But Officer, it was the only fair way to decide who got the parking spot.
He called it street-racing, but I was unfamiliar with the rules.
I had to challenge his claim of 300 horsepower.
To be fair it started as a crusade for bike lanes, but my message has gotten a little confused.
But officer, they did not honorably yield!
The steed was self-riding, I swear.
But they were parked in the bike lane.
Is this the best armor you have?
As knights, we are sworn to practice the Dutch reach.
He charged at me first, Sir
Of course it was dangerous officer, he was driving a Pinto.
How could I possibly have T-boned the car from the inside out?
Sirrah, it was merely a ‘Rogue’ that I smote.
Sir, are you aware your headlights are out?
It wasn’t my fault my lord, the driver swung the door open into the joust lane as I galloped by.
There is no way I was speeding with something on one horsepower.
I find your armor to be laughingly inferior, Officer. Write that down. No need to thank me.
Don't you have some real criminals to catch?
This is why I can't use the bike lane
Thy driver doth flippethed me off.
Kind sir, 'tis merely a display of Chevroly.
Sir, the Renaissance fair doesn't start until next week.
I take it you're not buying my door prize story.
Please, Officer, this rue is between me and Chevy the Impala.
If he didn’t want to joust, why did he throw his shield out at me?
No officer, I didn’t find a door...I lost a car.
You put the driver on the other side, me thinks.
Let's do a selfie.
They called me a '"cab."
first prize was the front grill of a 1935 Mercedes Convertible
My husband locked the keys in his car... I didn’t have a choice.
What doth thou mean,insurance?
But Sire, he blocked the box.
If I had a hundred dollars for every time I’ve heard that one, I’d be a rich man.
I was just riding along with traffic when this door opened in front of me.
Hit and run? What gave it away?
No, I am NOT coming out.
You should see what I did to the toaster.
But everyone else was trying to slay the wagon.
The oaf was texting whilst driving.
Sir Godfrey was in a Bronco.
Yes, I got doored.
Sir, are you almost done drawing this door?
He was a worthy challenger but just didn't have the mettle
Yeah, but do you realize how tall windmills are nowadays?
Yes officer, I realize that reckless jousting is a serious offense.
...but he cuteth me off fine constable!!
Let's see YOU do it.
Sometimes I just need to express how not down I am with the system of technology and industrialization
Sorry officer, I was jousting a Mustang"
Um.. joust kidding, officer.
It seemed like a fair  fight to joust with a Mustang.
Yeah, technically you are double parked.
I was about to be doored officer. You would have done the same thing if you'd been in my stirrups!
Well officer, we coulda gotten hurt pretty bad - do ya think the guy shoulda checked his side mirror before door-ing us?
Horsepower vs Torque,I think we have a winner...
That is the last time the Black Escalade will open his door onto me lady’s bike.
Verily he attempted to cut me off, and no true knight refuses a challenge.
Doesn't the red light mean attack!?
I thought the sign read 'Yield Knight of way'
Prithee recognize, the beast came out of nowhere.
Here's my proof.  I had the right of way.
It called me a Luddite.
My horn wasn’t working and my brakes need a carrot!
In my defense, good sir, he was driving only 240 furlongs per hour in the left lane.
No officer, we Knights are not subject to your open door policy.
He ran a red light and I run a renaissance fair.
He stoleth my parking space!
Show me the no-jousting sign!
Squire, are you suggesting that I'm a bit unhinged?
Oh, great. You know what this is going to do to my jousting insurance?
Are you people ever going to learn how to use traffic circles?
Honestly, he did not look in his mirror before he got out.
I shouldn't have been texting and dueling
I think it was a Dodge "Charger".
Road Rage you Say??
If you let me off with a warning, I could do something similiar to your ex-wife`s vehichle.
It's a new app.  We respond immediately to mansplaining complaints.
Honest, officer. I was just trotting past cars in the bicycle lane when a driver opened his door.
I didn't exactly run. I galloped from the scene.
Well, he should have checked behind him before he opened his door.
If I said that I work for the Consumer Protection Agency, would you reduce the fine?
In my defense, it was a Chevy Impala.
From a Charger that refused to dodge.
If it helps any, I did have my seat belt on when it happened.
Can you hurry with that VIN number. This is getting heavy.
Sir Lancelot--Sir !
It was a 1957 Chivalry.
Yes officer, spelled E-L-O-N...
My pinto and I had no choice officer, it was a '68, Charger!
Can you wind your window down, Sir?
Sorry, she has a thing for Mustangs.
Let me off -- I’m a WHITE knight.”
He failed to yield, sire.
Well constable, it all started when Lord Bentley challenged me to a duel.
GET IT OFF!!
Ahh. The perfect shield! Thank you good sir.
I show no mercy to Cavaliers.
The windmills are evolving... I must notify the king at once!
Yes, I defeated the Grand Marquis of Mercury.
I won't apologize for aggressively fighting climate change.
But the other driver was sounding his trumpet and drunk on mead!
I really don’t think a sobriety test is necessary.
How am I wrong? He was the one who swung it open without looking.
DOI: Driving while Impaling
I couldn’t dodge his charger.
It was a hybrid breathing dragon.
’Twas a Lancer, my lord, and no match for my joust.
You can't blame me for the Byzantine traffic laws.
The carriage was horseless.
Fencer-bender?
But officer, intermodal jousting is legal where I come from.....
This is how we deal with road ragers where I come from.
We misplaced our GPS.
He told me to crack the door.
I thought it was a windmill!
What's a ticket?
I just wanted the donut.
I thought it would make a great door stop for the castle.
Sorry, didn't you say Tudor?
Hey, the rest of that beast wasn't touched
It was not I who was errant.
The electric horse had no driver.
But it was a Charger.
It seemed like an open invitation to charge, officer.
Sorry, but you can’t park here at knight.
To be fair, he DID open his door into the horse lane.
He zigged and I zagged. It happens.
The driver kept blowing his horn at me!
But sire, the metal beast made cursed sounds, and it's rider seemed to cast a spell on me with his long finger...
He opened his door in the middle of the joust.
When you write this up can you call it St. George and the Drag Racer?
Didn’t you see the demo...Musk was wrong when he said the new Tesla was lance-proof.
I’m sorry, my horse has AI.
It was a late model lancer...
There is no mistake he saw me coming, but the ram did not come close to a dodge.
A turn signal is a statement of intent, not a request.
But I was in the dedicated joust lane.
Clearly, I was in the Knight lane.
Just because his mustang has more horse power he thinks he can steal my park
We had a report of a mustang with one door causing trouble in the area.
Joust ‘cuz I can.
Officer, a woman's honor was at stake.
I asked what his ride was.  He yelled "Dodge!"  
I did, and impaled this.
An anachronism, wrapped in an enigma, inside a Hyundai.
I get to keep it.
I’m not sure why they call that steed a Mitsubishi Lancer, my good sire, it’s all beep and no fight.
Yon steed cheats, your majesty.
Milady never liked the Tudors.
The last normal thing I recall is agreeing to a match with a gentleman named DeLorean.
Clearly, this joust was rigged.
Cyber Monday went terribly wrong.
Officer, I left my registration in my tunic!
Wouldst fain report a citizen’s joust, my liege.
I didn’t run, I was running by
I Lance a lot of opening doors so you don't have to!
That’s what they get for opening their door into the jousting lane.
No collision, no quod a porta delenimentis.
I'm to be charged with disturbing the piece?
How did we get trapped inside the dragon in the first place, you ask?
As soon as you finish writing the ticket,  I can think of a dumb play on words for this caption.
I forgot my keys
“C’est Moi!”
But this is how the 2020 Buick LeSabre is supposed to look.
I had to take it out.  It was a Charger.
I hadeth the rightest of way!
A car! A car! My kingdom for a car!
The fiend did open his door in the biketh lane.
Not much of a Challenger.
He cameth out of nether yeh!
I promise this is performance art.
So-o-o...how 'bout those Seahawks?
Why can't they learn?  Don't open the car door until you check the jousting lane!
Say I'm on a bicycle; it's self defense!
Ford v Dodge Lancer
In days of old, when knights were bold.....and automobiles weren’t invented.
I'm not trying to do your job for you officer, but this is his door.
I only had one goblet of mead.
But officer, I was riding in the jousting lane and about to get doored!
Prouesse, Prius, who can say?
We need a jousting lane.
I'm sorry officer, but they thought their Mustang could beat mine.
Me thinks the bloke did not consult his rearview mirror.
a cab
How dare you question my paranoid delusions
It's not mine.
I was just trying to be a gentleman and open the door for her sir
Don't worry, it was self-driving.
So much for THAT 'Challenger' !
I've said it before, it's the fastest way uptown.
I’m not sure what happened, officer. I was trotting down the bike lane and someone opened their door.
Ride that horse in the bike lane and you're gonna get doored.
Sir, you're under arrest for car-jousting.
Elon said,"Whatever you do,keep away from the windows."
It certainly surprised them officer.
The jerk doored ME in the jousting lane!
My therapist told me to not let obstacles block my path.
It's defensive driving.
Trust me, I tried a carrot on a stick first, but the mule wouldn't budge.
this couldn't happen with a Tesla truck
I believe, officer, that I had the right of way.
It's only a puncture wound.
How else doth one slay an Impala?
It was the Knight Rider
Lucky for him, he was wearing his seat belt.
I thought the driver was a Democrat!
My name? It's... Uhhh... Gawain.
It had no driver, so I had to stop it!
In my defence, you were in my spot.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be fining me if I were one of those "bike messengers." Because then I'd be dead.
Under the Code of Chivalry, it was his fault for not looking first.
But you don't understand Officer, I'm a valet parking attendant at Medieval Times!
Officer, they should have checked for incoming traffic before opening their door
One less car opening into traffic.
And when he flipped me off, I yelled "Chivalry is dead and so are you."
Sorry Officer, but the scurvy knave was tailgating me.
I'm the victim here. I was in the joust lane and he doored me!
It's a Lancia. So I did.
I was in the jousting lane, and he doored me.
I'm sorry sir, I couldn't fit my knight driving glasses under my helmet
Of course I had MY turn signal on, officer. Why do you ask?
I don't know why it threw itself on my lance officer.We were just standing here and it came at us and landed on my lance. Honestly
I just got my squire's permit.
But officer Elon assured me it was lance proof.
A piece of his armor to show you his foul play.
that's the last time he'll cut anybody off.
I guess he didn't have enough horsepower.
Well, the sign clearly said not to park there during the tournament.
My bad, officer, but the driver called me a 'prick'"
This DOESN'T belong in my era!!  Where shall I put it?
I was never very good at parallel lancing.
You CANNOT give me a ticket just because a man on a horse defeated a man in a car with mere horsepower.
We were arguing about horsepower
Officer, you trying riding in the bike-lane!
Technically, it was you riding on wrong side of history.
That's right officer...Lance a Parking Lot.
Door me twice...
Elon Musk challenged me to it!
The car's name was Lancer.  What was I supposed to do?
Methinks some of us be well advised to take the pill that chilleths!
Of course, it is a front door from a Dodge Lancer!
He cut me off so I acquired one of his doors.
The knave's mount was a new Mustang
Prithee, it didst cut me off!
It says inflate the front to 32 psi and the back to 35.
So, I'm guessing that other guy said it wasn't his fault.
The driver of this car keeps getting his captions rejected.
He opened the door without looking officer!
The ad said it was a door buster sale.
But officer, the sign only says "No Parking or Standing".
A Knight of the Round Table does not yield.
So I’m at this renaissance festival and ...
I'm from Connecticut.
I tilted.
Yield? Never!
What else could I do? He threatened me first with his Dodge Cutlass
I had the right of way.
Frankly, who can resist teal gray for a new breast plate?
The guy with the fancy car underestimated my horsepower
Mitsubishi Lancer.   You ticketed any Dodge Chargers recently?
It was this or the bicyclist.
You say I need a fishing license?
I couldn't help it, sir. It was a Mustang.
I saw the light turn, but he is colorblind.
That cabbie didn't deserve the title "Checker"
It was self-defense. His horse had wheels and was in the wrong lane.
No, I said 'a tourney'.
Get to the point, Officer.
Only thing I can tell you is that he had 300 horsepower and wore a cheap armor
But it’s a love token from Lady Chevrolet.
But officer, he was driving a Challenger!
I’m not sure what happened, but a man with crazy white hair told me this is part of something called a Delorean.
Here, I've got the door for you.
I killed a Transformer.
I wasn't just tilting at windmills, Officer, it was a real gas-guzzler!
...As you can see the car went into me, I didn't go into it!
American made car, officer. I am quality checker in disguise!
Officer, the last thing I remember is that I was in Camelot and Merlin said I was late for the joust.
the door belongs to Hubie the evil cab driver.
He didn't use his turn signal.
Can you believe it? He opened the door in the joust lane without even looking.
I think it's a 2011 Prius.
I sweareth, it didst approcheth me at great speed!
Should've sprung for the jousting insurance.
By my honor, the brazen Corolla shall ne'er speed again.
It's our new promotion, officer. Checker Cab jousts the competition.
No officer, I was not texting and riding. This chariot ran a red lamp
'Twas the other man's folly.
Do I get points for accuracy?
You gotta admit, it’s a clean stab!
But I left a note on the windshield, officer.
Introducing the 2020 Dodge Lancer, Motor Trend's choice for best jousting vehicle in its class.
License and heredity, please.
Am I being detain'd?
I also offered them my horse.
I believe it was an Impala, officer.
He cut me off, I swear!
C'mon, give me a break, I'm on my knight shift!
I clearly signaled “stay put scoundrel or face doom,” and he gout out anyway.
What else am I to do with a Bronco coming right at me, good sir?
I'm sorry, Officer.  It was just a Yugo
Oops! I thought that's how you open it.
It's OK. I'm just testing the Tesla Cybertruck impact resistance.
It was moving too fast to get its license plate number.
Good Sir, this is my turn signal.
They told me the enemy was yellow.
My Kingdom for a KIA.
Here's the VIN. The rest is still parked in the fire lane at Medieval Times.
She ran the stop sign Officer
My wife says the only reason she won’t ride the horse is because it doesn’t have any doors.
In my defense, Officer, you were parked in a loading zone.
... Left lane is for passing only!!
...but officer, I was doored!
The stupid driver opened his door without looking.
O.K. Lancelot, what's your excuse this time?
It was my misguided attempt of a coup upon a coupe.
I hate my job.
It wasn't a complete failure to signal.
Joust Uber
The challenger could not dodge this valiant lancer.
I believeth this belongs to one of thy contemp'raries.
But I aimed at the windmill
I'm sorry,officer,I just couldn't slow down in time. I must need new breakshoes.
0fficer, really - putting more points on my license would be fedual.
Really, officer, I was only picking up trash.
Please report front and center for my insurance claim.
No, I didn't get the plate number.
It's an open-and-shut case of self defence, officer!
Chivalry 101: Always get the door?
They really don't make them like they used to.
Tally Ho!,” Fine Sir, I said. 
And he’s like all “That’s my lane!
How else was I supposed to signal?
No, not a -hit-and-run as much a spear-and-gallop, my liege!
Knight vision, officer...It looked like a cougar about to pounce!
It was an oncoming Mustang, of course I lanced it.
Officer, he pulled out right in front of me.
I thought he was challenging me.
But, officer, this is my blinker.
Sir Lance a Car Lot, I presume?
Lance, you did it again.
We got that son-of-a-bitch.
But officer ..... he started it!
ElonMusk said it was ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled Stainless steel.
Officer, I swear he said he was riding a mustang.
I can explain: I used to commute by bicycle...
I was aiming for the side mirror when the driver opened the door.
Well, the other ending didn't make sense either.
My horse didn't come with blind spot detection.
I don't think Renaissance Fairs and the Daytona 500 mix very well.
See? Way more fun than writing them a ticket.
The defeated knight fled leaving leaving a piece if his armor behind. 
As a knight of the round table I offer you evidence of my victory.
Because the knight...
The knight was short, wore no armor, and his chariot was called ‘The DeLorean’ or some such.
The Escalade was no match for this fearsome steed.
Perhaps a few guineas for your guild might dispel your angst?
He opened his door into the jousting lane without looking.
There's an ordinance against body piercing?
It's just a flesh wound!
Knight driving has its consequences.
Honestly, it was Elon Musk who asked me to test the strength of a new Tesla
I meant to glance it 
Not lance it.
Disturbing the peace? Surely you joust!
Obviously more then a fender-bender
I did stay in my lane officer.
I shouldn't be getting a ticket. I won the joust!
My smith added a fluxxe capacitor, so when the horse hits 88 mph...
Well sir, he opened his car door right into the jousting lane!
I caused the accident? Surely you joust!
Good Sir, he yelled “ shotgun!” when approaching the vehicle. Pray tell, what else was I  to do?
Never underestimate horse power.
No, it's okay. It's from a Lancer.
Dragster/Dragon - it could happen to anyone
In my defense they didn't use their turn signals.
Show some civility when greeting a knight of the Coer D'or.
Officer, please, I can explain.
Alas, 'tis a self-driving horse.
I dismembered the Rogue from the province of Nissan!
Medieval Times IS autonomous!
I think he got the point Sir
The driver said, "Surely you joust." I got upset...
But officer, I was just galloping down the road on my way to the Crusades when someone unexpectedly opened their car door.
You may call me Sir Lancel-auto.
It is not my fault. He signaled left.
Licence & Animal insurance, please.
I swear officer, it was a Mustang.
Renaissance festival ticket?
It wasn't my fault. They opened the door while I was in the bike lane"
But officer, this is the door to m’lady’s heart!
It came at me head-on...a Dodge Lancer.
Oops, sorry about that!  How many donuts is this going to cost me?
I’d like to report a flagrant violation of the rules of jousting.
He said his insurance won't cover this.
Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear!
But Officer, he was on the wrong side of the road!
Well, he DID open his door in the middle of a traffic jam...
He didn't use his signal.
Do you think this comes under collision or comprehensive?
Millennials, amirite?
He crosseth the solid lines.
My lady found the color offensive.
Further proof the airbags were faulty!
That's funny because my first car was a LaSabre.
Officer, he ran a red light.
Could have sworn it was a dragon, officer...
Oh, so it's my fault he didn't look first?
He tried to pass me on the right.
He challenged my horse power and then things got out of hand.
make out the Summons to Dodge Charger
Joust a minute, Officer...
Ye olde road rage got the better of me
No, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night
Foolishly I put the car before the horse, sir.
Shining armor, huh?
Can’t a knight at least try to be a gentleman by opening the door for another?
Officer, I was jousting and I won a 'door prize'.
It's a Coupe Kebab
I... found it this way
My foe doth ride a Mustang.
He didn't know why I pulled him over.
It's from an Impala--sort of couldn't help myself.
His invisible steed was to fast for me but I nailed his carriage.
He was trying to get onto 14th St.
He's got a considerable blind spot.
Somebody tried to take King Arthur's royal parking space and I get the ticket?
Sire, what doth thou bring to The Castle?
No, I do not recall their license plate number
A foreseeable consequence of driving defensively.
Sir, I am the Thane of Cardoor!
He really shouldn't have opened his door into the bike lane.
I glanced at my phone for only a second.
He didn’t see me coming in the horse lane
I got doored in the jousting lane.
First of all, don’t you want to know how we got in?
In my attempt to unhorse him, my lance dropped and accidentally struck his Mustang.
Sorry officer. The driver didn’t look when he opened the door.
No, officer.  I was jousting.  Not jay walking.
I've just gotten tired of folks not checking before opening their doors into the bike lane.
The name is Lance-alot.
I  got so tired of people taking my parking spot.
I told him if he took my spot again I'd be waiting.
This the last time it takes a swipe at me.
Strange guy—he kept going on about chicken.
Sir, Officer, My GPS told
me to turn left.
On tonight’s episode of The Shield...
Traffic downtown was positively Medieval.
Suddenly, the wagon door flew open....
I'm pretty sure it was a Mustang.
Officer, if you would PLEASE give me only a warning, I swear I will adjust the meds.
I'm confused, I was told my enemy rode a Mustang.
He blocked the box.
They said the drive-thru was for cars only.
But officer, I forgot that I wasn’t wearing my virtual-reality headset.
I'm glad I wasn't on a bike.
Actually, I was jousting with a cyclist in the bike lane when....
Well, he insulted my Mustang.
‘On what charge?’ I thought that was supposed to be my line.
He was in the handicap zone !
The guy has no mirror on this side, and I got doored.
It was a fair dual. The other Lancer lost.
I was seeking Camelot, not a parking lot....
Ironically, it was a Dodge Lancer.
They just don’t make Volvo’s like they used to, wouldn’t you say Officer?
As for the car door, I have no explanation, officer.
My friend Lance got a new Charger and I guess we just took the joke a little too far.
It tried to take my parking space.
It was easy: he was double parked.
Since when is there a law against texting while jousting?
It was a Dodge Lancer.
I think it was a Mustang or a Bronco
He opened his door right into the dedicated jousting lane...
It was a smite and run accident
How can you give a door a ticket?
It was just defensive riding officer, he passed on the right!
This is why you should never ride a Mustang in a match.
I was joust kidding.
How about a warning?
Can I blame this on video games?
He dost cutteth me off.
A Chevy insulted my horse's blanket.
Honestly Officer, I just had my eyes checked.
You're fining me for piercing his shield?
They sure don’t make armor like they used to!
What are the charges noble Knight of the Law?
Hark! I hath slayed thy guttural beast of 500 horsepower.
'Twas worth it to unhorse Sir Uber.
What do you mean this is a no jousting zone?
There I was, just minding my own business, when, out of nowhere, he just opened his door. Right in front of me!!!
I don't know how it got there, it came out of nowhere, honest.
Speeding, failure to yield, that's fine for jousting, but you're in Manhattan not Merrie Olde England, and I don't believe for a minute that your name is Sir Lancelot.
Well, that's why they call me Lancelot.
But officer, he opened his door in the bike lane
Sorry Senor Quixote, I’ll have to cite you for tilting at car doors again.
Impaling a car door in this configuration is topologically impossible, my liege.
I mean, who brings a car to a joust?
Officer, he won't be doing anymore dooring with this door.
Are you gonna how we got inside the car?
How am I at fault here? The other guy charged at me with multiple horses - that's against the rules!
But its my shining armor
I insisted on being a gentleman.
But the Steed was a Charging Bronco
I came, I drove, I concurred
I’m gonna let you go with a warning.
Awesome. But... The cyclists still are requesting that you stay out of the bike lane.
A Dodge EX-Caliber.  2007, I think.
Honest mistake Officer, it's my first day car hopping at White Castle
...another case of suicide door by knight.
...and about how fast would you say the Buick was going at the time of impale, I mean, impact?
As it’s your first offense I’ll joust give you a warning.
Right when I hit 88 MPH, there was a lightning strike, and...
I'm undercover.
He opened it right in front of me!
You're saying I was at fault?! ... surely, you joust, officer.
In my defense, he had his high-beams on.
Officer, I'm a freelancer, when one door closes another one always rips open.
I was riding in the bike lane when the driver suddenly opened the door.
I'll let you off with a warning...
No infernal beast shall waylay me on Park Avenue South.
''Does thou expect'th me not to attack'th a driver on thy phone?''
Forsooth. No Uber driver steals my fare.
When it wheeled I charged.
In my defense, he didn’t signal.
Wote ye well: ae coat of beaten egg, a heavy infusion of farl crumbs and a light dusting of  days old crumbling of farl, and this shall fry up main well!
I was in the jousting lane and he just opened his door right into me!
It's a lance sharpener
This dragon will never fly again
It appears that he fixed the shatterproof glass.
“ Well, Sir,  that’s why you need a horn...”
Yeah, Happy New Year to you too. Can I have my police horse back now?
It's fine, I have horse insurance.
I was obeying the law.  I signaled a right turn!
I did so because the lanterns on their metal steed were aflame to a great degree.
I missed the sheriff but I might have got his family.
I am the Knight of No Right on Red.
She wouldn't stop complaining about the broken air conditioner.
I thought this was a no fault state?
I was charging in my lane and this door suddenly opened.
But Mr. Officer, my horse is in labor.
You should have seen the other door.
The he said, "So do you use your lance a lot, Lancelot?"
He made a left turn at the last moment.
What's the problem Officer?  Haven't you seen a Mitsubishi Lancer before?
But, my good sir, twas YOU who doored ME.
We were only jousting, Officer.
There was a dog stuck in there, so I tried to break the window
So am I at fault?
Forsooth, my squire hath my policy number.
It was not a hit and run, I can explain
Sorry, he gets excited when he sees flashing lights.
It wouldn’t yield.
My kingdom for a Mustang.
Officer, that's roadway skill in
action, not reckless operation.
I didn't know you could get a ticket at the Demolition Derby.
It’s really the first time I hear about road rage...
They're supposed to stay out of the horse lanes.
Elon told me it was lance-proof.
But the salesman said I could charge the car.
Joust lives matter.
But he was driving a Mustang.
This is not what it looks like, officer. The Insurance Institute has added a new safety test and this car failed badly.
She didn't use her blinkers
They challenged—I triumphed!
‘He was about ye high’
A strong object attacked me, officer, but the occupants ran away>
I can't stand cars! They take too much space.
Clearly, Sir, the driver needed to yield!"
You'll find Elon Musk a couple of miles back.
Not my fault, officer. My steed saw a Mustang and went nuts.
I think I still haven't fully adjusted to my new contacts.
A fair lady asked me for assistance in giving someone the door.
The self-driving car drove right into the middle of our Renaissance charging battle Officer."
My superior said to hurry, there is a coupe at the palace.
I saw the radio antenna and got
confused.
' Twas no accident, the damsel hadn't  a  scarf.
He blinked first.
I joust can’t
In this land you forbidith texting and crusading?
What was I supposed to do...its mount was somehow INSIDE of it.
Surely you’re not going to ticket me – I only winged the metal beast.
I thought 'twas common sense to check ye bike lane before getting out, but alas here we are.
He was in the wrong lane in the wrong time with the wrong armor.
Checker Cab 1, Uber 0
Apparently all knight vision rates in this town is a lousy door prize.
Sorry, my vector was down.
I was trying to poke holes in their claims about side impact protection.
Sorry, Sire. Open door season doesn't start until midnight.
Wasn't it a Dragon?
My charger bested his.
Forsooth, hé hath ne checked his mirror.
Our kingdom is self-insured.
Take a right on park street, the Palace will be the first drawbridge on your right.
Nothing a bit of Armor All can’t polish up....
I was joust opening the door for my lady
'Mitsubishi Lancer, officer.
It’s like it came right out of another century, and now it’s just— hanging there.
My king is going to kill me.
It was not a hit and run, officer. I went into a half cantor.
I fought the car and I won!
I'm pretty sure it was a Mitsubishi Lancer.
THERE'S ONE DOOR THAT WILL NEVER HIT US AGAIN!
You've got to be jousting!
I've had it with those lousy Lyft drivers!
Don Quixote....De La Mancha
This happens every time my horse sees a Mustang.
I’ve defeated the Ford beast. Share my story.
All those in favor of the proposition, raise ... something."

{Why my last week's caption in this week's entry space?]
(For this week:]
"But officer, it was a 'Charger!
What's the real charge here, officer?
There goes my safe rider discount
Fair contest, officer, armour to amour!
How now, officer! I ride in search of the legendary Medallions of Taxi.
I assume it was a Dodge Charger.
It shouldn't count as texting.
My steed hath bested the Mustang.
Double parking???
I wish to assert my fifth amendment privilege.
You're right, I was tilting at DeVilles.
Fear not the Lancer of Mitsubishi.
And then, he started bragging about the horsepower.
Look, officer, can you let this one slide? I am up to my neck in chivalrous lawsuits as it is.
The Lexus started it.
Would it help if I said I'd been drinking?
It was his fault for stopping in the jousting lane.
I was signalling a right, and…anyway, here’s your door, officer.
I told them I could Jimmy it open, but I’ve never been very good with names.
Failure to yield, officer? Verily, but he started it.
Thy "Text Not Whilst Driving Crusade" will soon be the talk o'er all the countryside!"
Biagra. It’s like Viagra, but for biceps.
Rachel Maddow wouldn't give me a ticket.
I had no idea that Aston Martin DB5s were still being manufactured
I told him not to ride THAT kind of charger!
My opponent's armor did look unusual.
Has there ever been a clearer  case of self-defense?
I guess we know who's got more horsepower now,huh?!
It is a one door, one horsepower convertible.
Its security was breached.
Good Sir Officer, witness the demon Vin# of yon fossil fuel invader of the bike path I have humbly vanquished for thee!
Upon advice of learned counsel I taketh the Fifth.
What do you mean you've never seen Game of Thrones?
I guess chivalry is not dead.
He tried to open his door in front of a biker.
He kept saying it's a zebra crossing...
You really need to widen the jousting lanes
Officer, I'm not coming off my high horse -- they showed no regard for knight parking hours.
The driver opened the door to block my road rage but the VIN number is on the decal.
Officer: You say your name is  Sir Lance alot ?
“Not my fault, the driver opened  his door in traffic”.
The officer didn:1%2C%22surl%22:%22https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/contest%22%2C%22sref%22:%22%22%2C%22sts%22:1575496453371%2C%2
That's Sir Lyft Slayer to you...
Yes, it’s my own Accord.
But officer this is proof I prevailed.
I just wanted to test its mettle.
Aren’t you the people who advise others to look before opening doors?
Ford Fiestas just piss me off…
Yon scoundrel openeth before me, I tell you.
Yes, that is blood on the end of my lance. I was in the bike lane and that guy deserved what he got.
To be fair, it was a Dodge Charger.
I need a new career
Have  I convinced you that there’s a right and wrong side of the road?
I say constable... I had the right-of-way.
So you see, sir, my horse cannot go above the car speed limit.
Thy sign commanded, 'Dead End.'
This flying DeLorean appeared out of nowhere.
Not my fault. The horse told me to do it
At least I got the package delivered on time.
Officer,
To the victor go the spoils in the fight against bureaucracy.
I thought a Ford Pinto would be a worthy challenger.
Name? Starts with L, A, N, C
Just because my horse had a few beers doesn't mean that *I* was driving under the influence
I had green!
Joust do it
The Knight Rider had more horsepower and got away.
Sir Chevrolet says he! Defeated in fair combat!
Is there a Mitsubishi Lancer missing a car door?
Officer, no worries.  I have collision coverage.
Forsooth, 'twas an '83 Mazda, officer, but victory is mine!
Are you saying chivalry is dead sir?
The other guy was driving his Lancer right at me, Officer!
You made your point about horsepower, but it’s still destruction of property.
So, do you lance a lot?
I swear a Dragon was driving.
‘Twas a Mustang, sire.
Another suicide door.
I guess I had more horsepower.
License and registration.
He was in the jousting lane.
It was 'joust' a mistake.
It happens everytime I see someone driving a Toyota Avalon.....
It’s not my fault. I distinctly heard you tell him no parking before knight.
I don't see the problem, officer. He was coming right at me.
Something tells me you've already figured it out.
It was knightime and my horse doesn’t have headlights
Tis manifest my foeman didst commit the more dishonorable offense of joust and run."
I rescued it from a Mercedes in distress, but it may not survive.
It was self-defense.
How many points do I get for this one?
But officer, I need it so I can roll down the window when I get too hot.
If you frame it as “criminal mischief”. But there’s no law against CHIVALRY, is there?!
I don't care if your carriage is horseless. It was still self defense!
Forgive me, but it moved, and  I thought it was a windmill.
I think it was a Mustang.
In fairness, this can happen when you joust with a Bronco.
I won fair and square  even though he had 299 more horsepower than I"
I don't need to show you no stinking medallion!
He should have checked his mirror before opening!
It’s like it had a mind of its own.
Thy Lord locked his keys in his car.
I'm spearheading a new sport for the  next Olympics.
He met me on the field of battle astride his Mustang.
Roll down your window and keep your hands on the reins sir.
But officer, I was just attempting a citizen's arrest!
But, somehow, the delivery bike got around him.
Sir, that is what he gets for passing on the right.
No, Officer, thank goodness he wasn't wearing a seat belt!
I told them twice not to park where I tie up my horse.
All I can tell you is that's why no one should open the door without looking first...and I definitely had the right of way.
I'd like to report a dooring incident.
Admittedly, officer my  driverless car concept is something of a work in progress
Modernization ain't shit
What’s the big deal? It was a Mitsubishi Lancer.
Could you let me off with a warning if I swearest not to joust in the bike lane again?
I wounded him in his left front before he got away.
I shouldn’t have agreed to let him joust on a Mustang!
No,I'm not sorry--I had to stand my own ground!
How long do I have to stay still for it not to be a moving violation?
Sorry, Officer. She’s got a mind of her own.
It attacked a rider in the bike lane so I thought the chivalrous response was to lance the offending vehicle.
In fairness to me, it was a Mitsubishi Lancer.
But this was part of his armor
The directions said to take a sharp right.
Unfortunate the Volvo had to face death over a parking spot.
What's the fine for texting while riding?
Alas, my liege, I failed to defender milady's Honda.
Like my jaws of life?
It's not my fault, officer.  He parked in a jousting zone.
I slayed a Toro. as per the royal Fiat.
But I joust had to stop him
He shouldn't have opened his door into the bike lane.
Got  the door but missed the driver.
The other guy didn’t stop saying he had to get to charging station asap.
Sorry, Officer, my aim was bad.  I was tilting at windshields!
I simply gave the driver a tip.
They don't make breastplates like they used to.
It wasn't my fault. Your car was parked in the bike lane.
Frankly the real crime here is this low quality manufacturing
I would've pulled over sooner, but I got stuck in traffic.
He ran the stop sign!
They sure don't make 'em like they used to.
That'll teach HIM to drive at a knight.
A Mitsubishi Lancer challenged me at a red light.
Knight: We were just jousting around. 
Officer: I don't tolerate horseplay around here.
In my defense, it was an armored truck.
I'll have to write you up for a 523.
But I had to go a long way back to get you one of The Doors.
I know what you're thinking, and alcohol was NOT a factor.
The other guy fled on foot for some reason.
I didn't realize that committing an anachronism was a crime.
I've been asking for a "No Parking" sign in front of the windmill for ages!
The driver was so smug bragging about his "zero emissions" vehicle. Elmer here just ate lunch; his digestive system shall not be besmirched!
This is all I could stop from the speeding Dodge Lancer
It was elaborate stunt to try to prove it was indestructible.
The door flung open in the bike lane - what was I supposed to do?
Officer, it was a Mitsubishi Lancer. What would you expect me to do?
I'm working my way up to windmills.
He said he was a 'Knight Rider'.
C'mon, officer! He threatened my horsepower.
He was tailgating.
I hate Mustangs.
Can you please point me in the direction of the Tesla Cybertruck?
We have another Don Quijote impersonator
Carbon smoke and fire! It is you that is the dragon.
He challenged me to a game of chicken.
A damsel in distress accidentally locked her keys in the coach.
NBC hasn't produced a police procedural this bad since "Cop Rock."
Elon Musk issued me a challenge. As a knight I could not deny him
Did you say it was a mid-century Cavalier or you are?
I thought it was ajar.
Well take your performance art someplace else or I'm writing you a ticket.
See? No steel beam protector!
Doesn't being in the cross-walk count???
Well, if you don't know, how should I know what it is?
What no jousting zone?
As I rode down 5th Avenue in the Jousting Lane, Suddenly......
Why, yes, my worthy opponent was riding a Mustang. How did you know?
And thus, the coupe de gras.
I felt challenged.
Officer, I swear I was in the horse lane.
If we had dedicated lanes, this never would have happened.
That's life in the joust lane.
Yeah, buddy it's a clear case of Spear and Run.
How can it be a hit-and-run if I'm still here?
The accident happened in the Renaissance Faire parking lot.
Alas, I have injured your steed!
You're going to charge me?  Surely, you joust.
It was either the Mustang or me.
It’s just a very alternate side of the street parking accident.
It’s joust a joke officer!
It’s not what you think, officer. I’m training to become a picador.
You didn't slow down at the 'whoa sign'
Thou doth protest too much....the airbag was compromised.
I want to report a car that doored me in the bike lane.
The only fair prize is your Crown Victoria.
Officer, my horse ate my jousting license.
I told the dealer this horse had a blind spot

With my steed in the car it was the only way I could get out.
I was joust galloping defensively.
It was like this when I got here, Officer
So, David Hasselhoff isn't a knight?
Mayor de Blasio's orders.  This guy was riding in the bike lane
It was my right of way.
Did someone say law and o'door?
Tournament rules now require a side airbag.
He wanted to race and I blew his doors off.
When is a door not a door?
I used to cycle to work.
T’was an Impala.
Sorry, your Official Seal bore the Crest and Motto of an Ancient and Mortal Foe.
Yes, Sir. I do happen to be Lancelot.
Milady would have been more impressed with an SUV.
He was trying to take my parking space!
It's not what it looks like: he came at ME.
It's all in good jest until someone looses a door.
So... I was in the middle of scene 3 when this happened.
I do freelance work for Tesla's new CyberTruck division.
We had the green light.
I offered a draw.
Officer, I was just jousting around - can you let this one slide?
I drive a Mitsubishi Lancer, why do you ask?
Sir, please come off the horse. We've got an APB on a Mitsubishi Lancer
Knight Mare
He opened it right into the duel efficiency lane!
I make a mockery of the beast thou doth call a 'Dodge'
My statement:  "No Fault Insurance"..........
I was just minding my own business, keeping to the bike lane.
Constable, he challenged me in the jousting lane!
Chevy is not dead!
But we're playing 14th Century rules here!
I think it was a DeLorean.
You see, sire, I lost my keys.
I suppose this sort of thing happens when you joust with a Ford Mustang !
They don't make them like they're going to.
My wife suggested T-bone.
Why are you writing me a ticket? THEY were parked in the jousting lane !
‘’ This weakling is giving horsepower a bad name.’’
Lance up, don't shoot!
'Twas he who lowered his visor first.
It's driverless!
The Chevrolets are our sworn enemies.
There is always more than one way.
The door-opens in the horse lane are a problem.
I don't know what happened here, but this has got to have someone to blame.
I know your more tolerant now, but a knight cannot extend it to Dodge Challengers.
This was off one of those self drive automobiles.  It mistook me for another car and I had to defend myself, officer.  It was life or death.
Is there among you any gentleman who for the love of his lady is willing to try with me some feat of arms?
Twas a "Duel" with Sir Dennis Weaver.
It was interesting how I got this from inside the car
I'm doing performance art titled: Revenge of the  
"Door'ed Bicyclist"
But I was in thy horse, bike, and chariot lane!
Don't worry, it was a Tesla.
Mr. Musk said it has to pass every test, Officer.
Breaking and entering?  What a ridiculous charge!
Don't block the box. Right?
Uber driver !
It was an old but still dangerous Pinto!
But officer, he pulled out in front of me!
It’s not my fault. He was parked in the bike lane.
He was parked in the jousting lane.
I should have sold my used door on eBay!
I'll admit to driving under the influence of Honor.
You may have an impelling case but for a start, let me see your license, registration and insurance card.
I was joust kidding. He took me very seriously.
Any leniency for a guy with only one horsepower?
Isn’t that adorable
My opponent was pretty fast but his shield was weak!
They just won’t stay out of the jousting lane.
I swear officer! He opened his door without looking.
He stole my parking place.
I pay your salary, and this is how I'm treated?
That'll teach the bastard to door me!
I had no choice, he was going the wrong direction on a one way street
And that’ll be another ticket for an exposed weapon
Defending fair maiden bikers everywhere!
Well, I didn't get "doored".
What else could I do?  Turning left was my first choice!
Lance, I dunno how you do it.
I was doored.
He's lucky it was just the door.
I had no choice. I’m positive it was a Dodge Lancer.
Mat-a-door
But officer; I believe the statute of limitations us up.
I had the right of way, but he wouldn't yield, sire.
...as long as you write on the ticket I won the joust
It looked like a windmill to me.
Honest, officer, I just drove down for the afternoon from Connecticut to see the Yankees game when I was brutally assaulted by an empty Tesla driving in autopilot mode.
It was a Lancer, Sir.
Fie on your ticket Sir, but the Damsel, she is still  mine.
I'm making a citizen's arrest.
It was a hit-ith and run-ith, my dear constable.
Your police cruiser is a Ford Crown Victoria, and you say I'm the one who is out of date.
Officer, you can see clearly I was NOT at fault because he opened his car door against the flow of traffic
‘Thanks for the commendation, Officer, it just won me 1st Place at Pitch In, Pick Up Day at Central Park.”
I am the road side assistance."
He tried to run me down in a '73 Lancer.
I plead the second, officer.
Not my fault—I was doored.
Officer, I was just trying to make a U turn.
It’s all fun and games until someone loses a car door.
Can you please send me the ticket by raven?
It's an expressionist piece. How do you not see that?
Well you’ve made your POINT, but it’s gonna cost you.
I needed a taxi.
I was just trying to help mute the TV in the back of the taxi.
Lucky he wasn't wearing a seat belt.
But Elon Musk promised it wouldn't go through.
I don’t understand why I’m the one getting the ticket when he was the one illegally parked.
Your horse and I would both like to know what the hell your doing?
That was clearly a Mustang, officer.
But officer, they were parked in the jousting lane!
And what if I don't put down the car door? Do you really think you're in any position to defy me?
These things can happen when you don't use your turn signals.
Yes officer, unfortunately I’ve impaled my foes mustang.
He shall 'door' no more
It was from a Pierce Arrow that challenged me.
It's not my fault my opponent didn't think to bring a lance.
Question me not jester! It's my spoils of victory!!
Officer, I was in a clearly marked joust lane.
When I carry my lance, I always have the right of way.
He lost the joust.
Sorry officer, I got carried away. The man in the iron horse stole my parking space.
I was just helping Mr Musk testing the new Tesla model
'Tis not a violation good sir, I've merely redefined what '92 Ford Probe means.
But Sir, 'twas you opened the door afore looking...
No my good man, it's Preuilly with two l's"..
They just don’t think to check the bike lane.
It's self defense.  It's a Jaguar!
Prithee sir, where ist thy city’s e-recycling center?
But officer, I can explain. I just came from a  new Tesla truck bulletproof test.
Officer, that metal dragon was attacking me"
Lane splitting.
I hope that's a ticket to ride.
Will the rest of the car be at the impound lot or must I travel across the Hudson?
'Twas the strangest Charger that e'er have I seen!
It was an Uber and my horse was jealous.
Not another jousting ticket, if you please, Sire!
Could you also include in your report that now I have more horsepower?
But officer, it's a Mitsubishi Lancer.
One step towards the crucial defense of the bike lane!
I am not your knight in shining armor!
Don’t joust and drive. It’s the law.
So this was the door to the future!
I looked at the window and thought I saw a horse charging at me.
I couldn't help it. It was a Dodge Charger!
It is within my rights to not roll down the window, officer.
It's a pennant from the Fair Lady of Double Park.
It seems that on my perilous quest to saving a princess, traffic laws and policemen are the greatest danger
I locked my keys in my car and this was the closest thing to a coat hanger I could find.
Is attempted car-door yakitori a crime?
I'm tired of jostling for space in the bike lane.
This is what I think of modern life. Ticket or no ticket, my horse and I stand by our principles.
My liege I do swear it hath power of 120 steed.
I was in the right lane, not going too fast, and she just opened the door.
My quest was to defeat a Challenger.
No, no, good Sir. Thou art the nuisance.
Yeah right! I suppose the Yankees play in Connecticut also.
Me and Sally here have defeated 27 mustangs now.
He turned left in front of me.
Well, it charged me, then I responded.
no harm came to the knave behind this shield, sire
You mean this isn't how one gets into these new horseless carriages?
He'll say he had the right of way, but the Knights Templar do not recognize Toyota swine.
Elon Musk said it was bulletproof.
Sorry, Officer. I thought I was tilting at a windmill.
Sir, you are under arrest for DWL — driving while lancing.
I thought we were all supposed to work together to create a more walkable city.
It was a Conquistador.
Well it was a Charger, but that’s still not fighting fair.
Good thing I left my bike home
I believe it was a 1523 Dragonmaster Sire.
So, you thought his car was a transformer?
His gate was opened amidst the jousting lane
It was a ye Oldesmobile.
In my humble defense squire, t'was parked like an absolute arse!
Hey, I was in the Joust Lane...!
We we both going for the same parking spot.
No offense here. Simple, at the Renaissance Fair you learn that if something comes at you with great speed, you lance it.
Watch yourself good squire, even the dragons wear armor now.
The knight is fine, but the horse wasn't so lucky!"
The sworn enemy of all things Tudor--since you ask.
Is it not a 'bicycle, etc.' lane?
Provides better wind protection than the visor...
The keys were locked in the car, so I gallantry offered my assistance..
That Autonomous Vehicle did not recognize me!
Normally we don’t  respond to taunting.
He cut me off so I Quixoted him!
It was a hit and gallop.
Who brings a car to a Jousting fight?
They just don’t make them like they used to
The Renaissance Festival does not allow double parking.
I beg your pardon, constable, but I was familiar only with the prohibition of tilting at windmills.
It wasn't my fault..I told him to get off his phone, but he didn't listen.
Well sorry, but the car was parked in the jousting lane.
jil
Sir, I'm a licensed troopadoor
Hey, if this town had a windmill or two, things like this woudn't happen!
What?! It was just a Kia Soul!
You gotta tell me where to get one of those swords.
Does this mean a point on my license?
Fair fight. Your police car was a Mustang, right?
You may call me Sir Mayhem.
Humorously enough, it's from a 2017 Mitsubishi Lancer.
It was self-defense, officer. I thought he was going to "door me".
No, you can’t finish your shish kabob.
No contest, sir: it was a driverless car.
I checked and it was speeding
When is door, not a door?" you might ask
He was in the wrong lane.
I thought it was a Nerf lance.
Shiska-door!
Yes, that's correct, officer.  My last name is Petard.
Hold still, mate!
Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
He tried to take my parking spot...
It was a Dodge charger.
I think you should write the driver of the car a ticket for Failure to Observe an Active Jousting Lane.”
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to book a good joust in Manhattan?
I thought it was a pitard.
I dunno, I was in my lane minding my own business when ...
Then he said he had more horsepower.
I swear it was self-defense!
I suppose I should have let him door me?
Forsooth, I am but avenging the grievous injury inflicted upon my faithful knave, Squire Raleigh Trek of Schwinn.
It all started when he bragged about his car having much more horsepower...
It was a Mustang,sir. I promise.
Not my fault,officer, he was double parked!
My key is in my other cloak
It's my heritage -- I'm an Impala-er!
Well, back home we drive on the left.
I am enforcing a restraining order from Lady Dulcinea,
sorry...
Where’s your license?
What was she thinking opening her door into the jousting lane without looking?
Back seat driver, Officer.
Officer, I saw a Mustang coming toward me...
It was self-defense.  It was a Lancer.
Since when is it a crime for a knight to disable a dragon's wing?
I honestly didn't think this prop lance would go through your door officer.
Yes, officer, the sign said "No mustangs, only javelins"
Who told him to bring a Volkswagon to a jousting match?
I got a little carried away testing the airbags.
He was coming right at me, Officer. What else could I do?
That’s not what I meant when I said I was tilting at the time of the accident.
Officer, I think you'll find that this is covered under the Lemon Law.
The last name is spelled L-A-N-C-A-S-T-E-R and yes, I have slain the filthy Tudor
It was self defense constable.  The door swung into my path and I had but a moment to react.
But officer, I thought it was a windmill.
By my troth, I smell bacon.
I lance...a lot.
You said everybody HAS to pitch in to cut down on speeders.
Joust a mistake, officer.
Then my wife said it was time to leave the Renaissance Faire, so I did what any good knight would do - I jousted her for it.
My toughest competitor was  a Checker cab -- but when he got pushy, I showed him the door!
Sorry, Sancho lied and said it was a possible dream.
It was clearly in the No Joisting lane.
It was a Ford Varlet.
My dad told me to "wing it"!
Twas a varlet in the non-automobile lane.
The peppers and onions fell off.
Alright, Lance, what's your last name?
Finally, that creature, the Tesla Cybertruck, in no more.
Stop and joust?
The guy said corporations paid for catalytic converters, and I just snapped.
I think the bar wench put something in my goblet. I don't usually tilt at windshields.
Please, try not to speed next time.
Whoops....sorry...
What can I tell you, my ride is self driving.
The idiot met a left turn right into my lance
"Officer is there any way you could roll the window down this suit is getting hot?''
You should see the OTHER guy's door!
I yield for no man or machine!
Fear not, good sir, for I have slain the metal beast!
I wasn’t even going that fast. This ride is only one horsepower.
He didn't signal.
Officer, I was not drinking underaged, just Middle-Aged.
Well they said it was a lancer. Shouldn't it have dodged?
It was a duel to the death. Unfortunately,my spear caught the wing of his stupid creature as he was escaping,
I'm not the one who parked his car in a jousting zone.
I have slain the smoke belching Hyundai.
I think the scofflaw will be easy to apprehend.
I believe it was a Dodge Challenger.
This is strictly between Uber and me, Officer
How long is this gonna take? Are you entering a caption for the New Yorker too?
You say it was a Pierce Arrow?
See, those taxi drivers are trying to block our new business model
We're knights of the round table, we'll drink whenever we're able.
Classic hit and run...I hit, he ran!
I found it at the prick n pull.
I'm hardly worthy of a citation, m'Lord.  The brute was parked.
This is what happens when cars go into the jousting lane.
Well, I guess the Knight Rider was doomed to lose eventually
Let me guess, dinner at Mid Evil Times again last night.
I was just driving through.
Illegal use of the bus lane?  That's all you've got?
See?  Not everything from my past is checkered.
I think it's probably best that I missed the target."
Honestly, I didn't think that a horse could get up to 88 miles per hour, especially with one horsepower.
I didn’t have time to react.  He opened it right onto the bike lane.
I think it’s a 1978 Lancer.
A New Choice of Armor
I see a car below 72nd St, it's fair game!
Listen, the guy just came out of nowhere. I turned to joust, and ... bam!
I won
But I did signal before I turned...
It's not illegal where I come from, my dear Constable.
I am just so tired of being doored!
I fight at behest of the LeBaron
He boasted it had 350 horse power
Pray thee, kind sheriff, leniency, for ‘twas only a much-used Ford Fiesta.
Not another one of these climate crusaders.
But Officer, Mr. Musk insisted it was “medieval proof”!
I was acting under orders from the king - honest!
I thought alternate side jousting was still in effect.
He said he was the knight rider and his steed was named Kitt
As a Knight of the Checkered Order I am duty bound to fight all Uber's and Share-rides.
I thought I'd gotten to the heart of the problem.
But he doth merged sans signal.
I guess now they have really seen a thing or two!
The varlet opened into moving traffic.
Oh Impala...I though you said Impaler
I'm afraid Knight takes Door just isn't in the rules.
I don’t share the road!
I've been having trouble with time travel, lately.
The front door sticks.
I just got sick and tired of getting 'doored' on my bike.
If it moves, It dies" ... "I see
Officer, I took care of the driver's road rage!
Surely you’re jousting.
It was a paid demo for the Cybertruck to show that the doors couldn't be breached.
I didn't realize police bias now extends to neo-Luddites.
'Twas a fair fight-The steel steed flapped his wing and paid the price.
What is this no-fault of which you speak?
I am on a noble mission to chastise an errant Uber Driver
Officer,a just society cannot tolerate double parking.
There you have it, my recipe for driving-jerk-kebab.
Had I'd known it was not a joust then I would have pulled over!
‘Twas she who ran the light!
‘Lead the way to the barbecue pit, knave.’
Sir Lancador, is it?
The Medieval Times are to your right.
Then you tell me what the Joust Lane is for.
He was in the horse lane, officer!
I thought it was a Dodge,
but apparently not.
whatever it is, I'm sure it's illegal
I really didn't expect them to open the door that wide.
R.I.P., chivalry.
This is what happens when you take a 25mph off ramp at 50.
'Knight of the road you say?'
I rushed over as soon as I heard the Amber alert.
I was aiming for a scooter and missed.
It was an accident.
This jerk was double-parked!
They play a strange game, but I won!
I was Hail Hail Hailing a taxi
It's our version of the Boot.
Sir, this brief case is full of pens, hence I have proven that the pen is not mightier than the sword!
But he charged thee first!
Zounds, and they said the age of Chevrolet was dead!
They didn’t use their turn signal.
I know I come from a checkered past,but he was asking for it.
This is the passenger side door.  The driver got away.
It's Knight time!
The Horsepower on this thing is insane.
I’m afraid failure to yield is not a defense in this case.
Road rage meets Renaissance Fair, I guess.
They don't make cars like they used to.
They locked their keys in the car?—surely you jest!
He said it was the only doorway to heaven so I bought it
My autopilot stopped working.
Just what year did you say your Checker cab is?
Sir Pierce-a-door, I presume.
Surely, thou knowest,  I had the right of way.
I'm trying to make a point about bike lanes.
Impaling Traffic?" Since when has that been a violation?
I joust you not!
This is called a partial "HANGING CHASSIS."
Officer, he opened the door into the chariot lane.
He said Charger.
I believe I had the right of way, officer!
Where's the Crusade?
All I know is it had a lot of horse power.
That's a 10 shilling fine for not using a tourney lance.
You can't mechanize the past.
It's Sunday.
I needed to defend the honor of my lane
Drop your weapon, get off your horse, and show me your drivers license.
they don't call me Sir Lancecarlot for nothing!
Excuse me sir, I believe this is 2019!
Can we just say I slew a gas guzzler and let me off with a warning?
But officer, I was clearly in the jousting lane!
"It's his fault for using a shield made of fiberglass."







It's hi
The jousting keeps me from texting.
It had to be vanquished.
He started it---he was mouthing off, said he had 300 horses!
It's because of drivers like these that I gave up on riding my bike to work, officer. Nobody bothers to look before opening their door!
But Elon said it was lanceproof.
I apologize, officer. The metal horse was charging at me. I thought its rider wanted to joust.
I'm sure it was a Charge.
Verily,I did not yield
But officer, they told me it was a Lancer.
Nobody mocks my horsepower!
I'm sorry but . . . he was parked in the jousting lane.
Talk to the stable.  They said he comes with fully autonomous self-driving mode.
It’s only legal if you impale an electric scooter.
Behold! Uber-Justice has been served! The Medallions have been defeated! May side streets once again flow unabated and all that is right and good return to Midtown.
The wind caught it first.
YOINKS
Rush hour gets me every time!
It was a Mitsubishi Lancer with the visor down that cut the light.
This is what I caught spearfishing in the Hudson at knight.
Battle of the ages? I call it destruction of property and theft.
Victory is my insurance!
He was about to make an illegal turn, sire, so I pursued. Sadly, the rest of him got away.
It was a citizen’s arrest.
Hang on a sec, officer. Let me roll down my window.
Don't tell Elon
I think you shall find me a more worthy opponent than an unarmed black teenager.
Well, officer, at least chivalry isn't dead.
His lights were not on.
It won't get very far, Sir Coppe -- I took one of its wings.
I just found this thing in the alley, officer.
Hey, I had the right of way!
I'll need to see your knighthood registration and insurance card, Sir.
Look, I don’t care if you signaled or not. Road rage is still road rage, no matter the century.
The Tesla charged first.
I have slain the beast...it's a chevy!
This is all that was left of the self-driving horse.
I'll have to write you up for riding in the bike lane.
In my defense, he was driving a Mustang.
You should see the windmill
Officer, I admit I was mad when the Uber driver said he would meet me at the moat and then was late.
They really have to remake Monty Python and the Holy Grale too, huh?
Methinks it's plastic.
Sorry officer - I have no idea what I've got on my sword - it's definitely not a steak but maybe cartoonist can give us a hint!
Officer, I have a PBA card.
Uber schmoober
'In my defense officer, this talking car also claimed to be a Knight Rider'
They don’t make armored cars like they used to.
Sorry,Officer.  I saw the word Rogue on the back and I guess I just saw red there for a moment.
Thou hast attempted to door me and now this?
I was only signaling a ..”Right Turn.”
Doored
You are right, there is no parking in the jousting lane.
Pokémon, rides again❗️
You see officer, Back in my day...
I couldn't take the greenwashing of Toyota, GM, and Fiat Chrysler anymore. 

They pretend to care about climate change, and then support removing California’s legal authority to set tougher greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars.
I was at full speed when the traffic light turned red.
I don't know how it got there Officer".
Forthwith I have come from the 12th century to champion Kings, Maidens and Checkered Cabs, good sir.
No sir, I do not have insurance
I was playing with the driver of a Mustang.
I swear I had green light
Hey Quixote -  We don't spear Mazdas in this town..... Now get off your ass and step away from the lance!
Just a Tesla...I am for true horse power!
Scout gets cocky when she sees a Dodge Charger.
'It was an unprovoked parking lot thwacking"
Offîcer, I believe this door is from an AMC. javelin!
We were going through the drive thru for a burger and the guy in front of us wanted to know if we had a tooth pick.
Sir, you can’t joust in a fire lane
Me and my buddy Chad are LARPers, see, and we just took up jousting 'cuz its so therapeutic, but one thing led to another and now I'm here.
I'm just looking for the rest of the car.
Driver's side front door, yep, that"s a $250 ticket
In my defense, he had a really weird-looking horse."
'Yon varlot tethered his steed in a bike lane'
Will this ticket affect my Uber application?
Someone said, Hail a cab.  So I did.  And after I yelled Hail!,  it came right towards me, and then, well, this.
Do you realize how hard it is to take this out of the car?
To be doored, or not to be doored
I say I point them out and you give them a ticket now ...
I'm sorry, Officer, but they just don't make gauntlet-friendly car doors these days.
I'm sorry officer, but he kept saying his mustang was better than mine.
Hey, he opened his door right into the horse lane.
Now I understand why cyclists are so nervous around parked cars.
The king’s new valet ? I see your point.
You’re being charged with jousting on the wrong side of the road, freelancing without a license, horseback riding under the influence, not wearing a seatbelt and possibly grand theft auto.... for taking the door
you are hereby summoned to King Arthur's traffic court tomorrow a.m.
Well, he charged me on his Mustang...
I was only defending myself from the other knight and his mighty Mustang.
It was a Charger officer.
It was a Lancer...
The other guy said he was going to blow my doors off.
But officer, the damsel locked her keys in her car.
I don’t know about that whirling vortex thing but I’ll let you off with a warning this time.
Next time just book a taxi online.
Skewer you too copper.
They were bragging about having more horsepower than I.
‘Tis a fair joust, he charge at me on the FDR
These damn drive less cars. It was coming right at me!
On the weekends , I'm a cyclist .
I guess it would be futile to try to convince you that I was not involved in a 'hit and run'?
My wife asked me to pick something up on my way home.
I’m your medieval 10th cousin! I’ve been looking for you!
I think that you were supposed to conquer..not car door
No, how fast was I going, Officer Krumpke?
Today is Black Friday doorbuster"
He was speeding
Looks like a slam dunk for a 'dooring' incident. The bloke in the parked car just opened his door as I galloped past.
And a very Good Morrow to you sirrah!
Sir, this Door is your Holy Grail, although not that holieth and not that graileth.
Medieval Road Rage

The cab ran a red light....surely you joust I suggested.
Chevy really is not dead.
He made a right turn in front of me.
Elon Musk told me to do it..
I'll return with driver soon.
The monster that openeth into the jousting lane without looking hath not been vanquished, but merely wounded. The VIN is there.
That shall show him who has the most horsepower.
I was barely trotting and it came out of nowhere.
Forsooth Sheriff, after defeating Lord "Checker-Cab" as he traveled by himself alone, in the HOV lane, he finally yielded, and thus my family's honor was restored.  Huzzah!
where shall i returneth this medieval door?
They should know not to park in the jousting lane.
Even if it was a windmill I would still be booking you
Jot this down rook. A car door won’t stop a lance it won’t stop any hot lead flying at your dome piece. That’s how you get your vibe checked. Yeet!
Why am I getting a ticket if they were parked in the joust lane?
Officer, he did take my spot.
Is there indeed a law against jousting in the bike lane?
You're still not allowed to park here.
He was going forty in a 25-mile zone.
Did you the get a nice sketch of us?
But Officer, you should've seen the way he was looking at me when he got out of the car.
I’m ready for whatever comes down the pike.
At least he won't forget to buckle now.
I’m protesting the ending of Game of Thrones.
The last time we raced he blew my doors off.
And your home address?
I saved a dog in an overheated car while strictly observing the speed limit.
It was joust a little misunderstanding, officer.
I thought that I was in the wrong century.
He said it was a vintage Javelin.  I said a vintage Lancer could beat that.
I have an obsession with tilting at Windstars.
Haven’t seen you around town before, you new on the ‘knight’ shift? Ha ha, get it? But seriously, my probation officer said one more strike and I’m going to jail. Please bro, have a fucking heart, I’m begging you.
I missed him by THAT much.
Violets are blue.
It's not my fault that he opened his door just as I was passing!
I wasn't jousting.  It really did happen the way I said it did.
The Jester almost “footed”me steed.  A mounted cop would understand.
Just say "1hp, 1 door Mustang" and let me be on my way.
Adoorable!
It's not my fault, officer. The human was horsing around.
I don't know what that is, I stepped into a time machine.
But officer it was a case of self-defense. It was a Dodge Charger.
Epstein didn't kill himself.
I lost my keys.
Well Sir, from your description it sounds like you got stuck in a DeLorean.
That's right. My name is Lance.
I couldn't find a windmill to tilt with
Sir Insurance
But officer, it's only the door ... not a full kebab offense."
The Christmas Parade went off the rails.
Thou hath the right to remain silent
Is this what your generation calls door busters?
The rest of it turned into a pumpkin.
Can I keep what I catch?
What--you've never been invited to a car-B-que before?
But there was no one riding this strange horse which charged me."
This was the Raptor, you should have seen what I did to the Ram.
To be fair, there is no jousting lane.
Verily, just a scoundrel who labeled himself "Regal."
Does your horse have insurance?
Yes officer...but when the door opened it was partly on 14th street"
Yes sir, I ran headlong into an open UFO
Quixote now supports renewable energy.
I took care of charging the other driver, officer.
That Mustang was coming right at me.  I swear!
Thee shall suffer dearly whence double parked fore Round Table Pizza.
Ye are charging me with “lance and gallop”?
It was the only rental with no airbags, so I had to improvise.
I am a knight of the roundabout. You may call me Mitsubishi Lancer.
Before you charge me, please explain how my steed mounted a charge from inside the vehicle.
No, my name is not Don Quixote."  Michael Sivak, Ann Arbor, M
As promised, no fingerprints.
Sir knight, they don't make armor now like they used to.
So when the Charger refused to give way...
Columbus Circle was supposed to be conflict-free.
Your shield was very ineffective, sir.
I had to, officer, he was in my lane.
They should have parked inside the moat!
He tried to dodge cause he was a challenger !
That was no Dodge
In my defense it was a Lancia
He cheats! His Charger is armored and weareth a seatbelt!
So much for Sir Dodge Dart.
It’s not my fault! He opened his directly into the jousting lane without even looking!
When I raised my visor you were supposed to open your window.
Blame the driver, not the lance!
She had the right of way? But women have no rights!
Well Mr Knight we can write this up as a violation of chess rules, It’s a sure Touch Move
My steed wins every race, but that blockhead refused to decrease his horsepower and let us pass."
It's not our fault.  We were in the crosswalk
Chevrolet is dead.
Suddenly the other steed's armour just opened up!
Verily, sirrah, the scoundrel would not yield.
It’s Tesla’s Cybertruck.
Listen, you really gotta talk to Elon.
The car was blocking the crosswalk
He was the one who side-lanced me.
Trust me, I'm never doing popcorn for dinner again.
An oxymoron 
if I ever saw one.
Did you get the license plate number?
It was just in joust, officer.
He challenged my honor, officer.
I had no choice.  It was a '66 Dodge Charger!
i lost my car keys
He said his name was Michael Knight.
I've got a 681: A hit and gallop.
But Officer, I was in the Pike Lane
To be fair... Lancer does sound a lot like Lancelot.
He deserved it officer, he stole my parking spot!
My apologies. In my haste to procure the parking space, I mistook my apparent foe to be an armored car.
Your right officer but he challenged me to a joust.
That'll teach them to call me 'Lance in his Pants!'
Strayed into the jousting lane.
Moving violation?!
Officer, I pledge that I had the right-of-way.
Don't worry, officer, it's just a hunk of middle-aged whimsy.
But officer, the fair lass asked me to close the door."
Just as I thought. It should've been recalled.
That's one Transformer who won't open his door in traffic again
Joust getting the door for Milady, Sir!
I thought for a second it was a windmill!
Do you want a ticket back to your time?
I thought they discontinued the Lancer.
They said you can't dent a Saturn
Are you stopping me because I was going to fax?
Verily sir, ‘tis a far greater sin to open thine door into oncoming traffic.
Second time I'm doored by an Uber parked in the protected jousting lane.
But I'm a Dodge Charger!  We own the fast lane
But the beast was running a red knight!
But officer, chivalry matters!”
I do freelance work for the NHTSA.
It's a MULE!  What did you expect?
He had a vanity plate
I looked it up: " No person shall open the door of a vehicle on the side available to moving traffic unless it is reasonably safe to do so" Doesn't say anything about daytime or at knight.
When I saw the checker barding on the other fellow, I knew I had to challenge him.
Please let me explain;. this is not your typical hit and run, officer.
Knight of the Checker Cab, I believe you skewered a Pinto.
But Officer, It was strictly self defense.
There is not enough parking at the Medieval Fair!
Because 'Parking Space Reserved for Medieval Times' means exactly that, that's why.
Thy New York armour is no match for me and my charge.
This is broken windows policing gone mad.
He doored me. Couldn’t get his license plate, but got this.
What do you mean,the wrong door?
Ride by jousting... it just so happens I have a listing for that.
Insurance information?  He just kept babbling about 88 miles per hour....
If I was a real knight I would have made you eat a football.
I was proving it was unbreakable!
I've never heard of a DeLorean!
We were trapped inside.  Honest!
Really officer, it’s not what you think....
The caitiff knave fled!
Well, a REAL Mustang could have handled it!
Your right Officer...it does make for a lousy Shield!
Officer, I had the right of way.
He didn't even look before opening the door into the jousting lane.
That's right. 3 points- for I hath unseated my opponent!
Think of it like a narwhal horn.
Well, when it gets too hot I roll down the window.
It was a Charger, but it couldn’t dodge my lance!
A citation for a fair fight for her Majesty? 
Dear Sire, surely you joust.
Have you been eating any comically oversized turkey legs this evening, sir?

Officer, I have merely delivered it from its vow of service.
He took a selfie with us and wouldn't tip.
It had gobbled up a fair damsel.
Well, he shouldn't have been parking in the spike lane.
My parking assistance computer is down!
Really, I latched onto it at the Brickyard.
It was an old jalopy that tried to run us off the road.  This trophy should help your investigation into this hit and run.
Consider yourself lucky. The Miramar PD would throw you down the river for this.
Windmill or not, I still think its a damned good skewer!
Oh, ha. Yeah, all I heard was "domestic disturbance" and "Lance keeps banging Alexis," I thought it was something totally different.

 I'm so horny. 

Anyway, the Lexus owner is pressing charges, and you're going to jail for meth usage.
Good thing he wasn't on a motorcycle.
I was riding in the bicycle lane.
You should see the other guy.
Oh, I thought it was a jousting match...
Mission Accomplished
It was a one horse open car.
This is much safer than delivering on bicycle!
A Mustang came at us
Sir, where is your seatbelt? Were you speeding? Where the driver if the other vehicle?
A ticket? Constable, may we joust like men. Leave the courts out of this.
You could say I'm a knight 'n shining car door.
We were jousting for a parking spot.
He called himself Chevy Cavalier.  He was fast but I got him on the turns.
I thought road rage only applied to motor vehicles.
You should see what I did to the dump truck.
I just wanted to be gentlemanly with the lady...
Kids these days don’t know anything about defensive driving.
How was I supposed to know it’s an automatic door?!
That’s not a falcon wing.
Insurance is much cheaper this way.
It will kill.
Sir Mitsubishi's Lancer has been discontinued.
I barely touched his car, officer!
No right on red? Go know.
When your opponents have armor like this, it really takes the fun out of dueling.
Well, he heard there were 190 steeds inside - just like him.
What? It was a perfect joust.
Can you roll down the window, its hot in here?
The sign clearly stated, "No parking in the tilt-yard."
He was driving on the wrong side of the road.
Hit and run you say? Hm... haven't seen anything...
I was just trying to be a gentleman by opening the door for her!
It was parked in my spot.
The DOT is testing side airbags due to unexpectedly high rates of failure to deploy.
Don't write ME a ticket!  Sir Uber started it!
I understand Sir, but there are no reserved parking spots for royalty.
Officer, this car door really WAS closer that it looked in my mirror.  Who'd have thought?!
I got tired of people opening doors into the bike lanes.
I think we should go back to using spike strips...
They parked on the wrong side of the road.
No Officer, it's not a spear, it's a Dodge Lancer!
The side-airbag doth not deploy.
I blame Dodge for calling it the Charger.
Romans truly were my ancestors.
Elon's going to be so pissed
I thought it was one of those cancer causing windmills.
Thou shalt issue less parking tickets.
Sorry, officer, but the guy cut right in front of me...
So be it, but it won't deter my quest to protect this fair city's bicycle lanes.
Please stop with “simply adorable”
Sir, step out your vehicle.
It was the Tudor knight Sir Coupe de Buick
No, I am not Lancealot so I do not have any priors.
I don’t know how I got here but when this miserable curr charged me I di
There are no windmills left in Manhattan.
Freeway...the damn driver was in a Charger coming at me at 80 miles per hour...
Just the fax, Sir.
Fewer things in police work are easier than solving a hit and run case at a Renaissance Fair....
I offer you a piece, Sir Piece Officer.
No horse, of course.
Door knobs, schnorr knobs. When you want to get in, you get in.
So you came from the past. That's what everyone says.
Knight-rider: officer I think kits dead
But officer, we weren’t event speeding!
I thought ye a Tudor
But Officer, New York State law says up to 30% tint is legal on a side window."
They call it a Pick Up. So !
It was really more of a hit and ride.
Well, I play chess...
It was a race, and he blinked
I was in the jousting lane, and then this guy just opened his car door without looking for jousters!
You'd be surprised how quickly I navigate the bike lanes now.
I need more coverage"
I  got the license number but he got away and his horse ran into the barn.
Looks like I "Impalad" this '68 Mustang!
They were blocking the crosswalk, what can I say.
Rough knight, huh?
I think I fell asleep in the self-driving time machine.
Just trying to get my share.
I thought it was a battering ram---
Sorry, I thought police cars were bulletproof.
I let him off with a warning. Speaking of which...
No, I’m actually NOT required to show you my ID, and this is really none of your business. Don’t you have some minorities to harass? Some innocent black youths to shoot? POLICE BRUTALITY, POLICE BRUTALITY!
'Just detailing", my *ss. Looks like an inside job to me.
They should get out on the passenger side
He's guilty. He lost the trial by combat.
How much do you know about horsepower?
Constable, this varlet deserved its wounding for violating the sanctity of yon Renaissance fair.
ojfqoiwgrnhqou[ghf
Since when did holding doors open become a crime?
Sorry Officer but I couldn't find a coat hanger.
Sorry, Officer. I've become a bit rusty at parallel parking.
'Twas was a Cavalier that threatened me in the previous cross-walk.  Thous shoulds't not cite me.  After all, I am -- technically -- a pedestrian.
Officer, his heart was on my lance!
Yes, he challenged me in the ‘Forest of I-95’”..
Hey buddy, Mitsubishi discontinued the Lancer in 2017.
Listen.. it's not what it looks like..
Proper documentation - first and foremost!
HE TOOK A WRONG TURN ONTO THE PLAYING FIELD, HE WAS COMING RIGHT AT ME, OFFICER - IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE!
No officer, I wasn’t jousting without a license: he just opened the driver’s side door on to traffic  as I was about to pass him.
It might have been a giant.
The taxi was wearing our colours!
But officer, I am I, Don Quixote, and it was a Nissan Armada!
You're paying for that. It's modern days.
The gentleman would not hold it open for the lady.
Verily officer, it was in fact a Tesla Cybertruck.
He just flung the door open and...
It’s a Chrysler Lancer!
That smug Prius driver told me his mode of transportation was more eco-friendly than mine.  I told him to recycle this!
It proclaimeth itself a Lancer and vouchsafed to Dodge. Neither avowal proved sooth.
You don't even want to know what will happen if you try to give my horse a ticket.
I swear there was another knight in that top section when I stabbed it
I bested Sir AMC and his Javelin.
You should be thanking me for doing you a favor; they were driving 60 in a 35!
Sure, write ME up! Meanwhile, the jousting lane gets no respect!
He called me old fashioned!
Something gets into me, I confess, when uncouth drivers make canned ham jokes.
His name is Bike so he has right of way
No sir, I definitely stayed in the bike lane.
Coulden't find a meter ?
I'm working on a similar model to keep bicyclists from being doored by parked cars.
Red light? I've never seen a light.
The king ordered me to go to White Castle and do a "drive through"
It’s not my fault that I know how to handle a mustang.
I' ve just had enough of people parking in the bike lane...
Officer, you don’t know the difference between a Ford and a chavalier.
In my defense, Officer, it was a Dodge Lancer.
Officer, I just got doored!
It cometh from a fair contest with a Charger of Dodge.
I didn't see the Dodge Charger label.
A white knight...nothing suspicious here.
I'm practicing for Prince Andrew's "Accident" next month!
The royal bike lane shall be honored at all times.
Sir, do you know why I pulled thee over?
Aw, c'mon officer. He was blocking the bicycle lane...
Fodor's Guide gave a can't-resist description of a four-door.
It was my charger against his Charger.
Just a little time travel, Officer.
I like to dispose of my old junk in style.
It was revving loudly like it thinks it’s better than mine.
The good news is, I increased my collision coverage.
I didn't get a look at the driver, but the car was definitely a Lancia.
We should get one of these, Horsey. Much . . . thicker.
My wife moved the seat up this morning
Do you need my plate number?
I was in the joust lane
My opponent often spoke of his gut if steel, but I never took him seriously until now.
Got it in the stands between chukka one and chukka two
One Middle Aged man to another, the mustang didn’t yield.
But Constable, it was a charger as well!
And only, then, I had sex with your wife
Officer, I left my insurance card at home, but if you can wait just a sec I can pull it up on my phone.
But it was just Prince Valiant on aMustang!
Gullwing door... I thought it was a dragons wing... sorry.
Sir, there’s been a complaint from the owner of that Ford Bronco over there.
We BOTH wanted that parking spot by the light pole, Officer. He simply found my argument more compelling.
I accepted his chicken challenge
It's a doored detector.
Cars should not be allowed to joust.
That car was blocking the box
That does it! You're toast!
In my defense, it was a CyberTruck
Windmills - printers, I tilt at everything.
The idiot opened his door without looking.  We were in mid joust!
You can have it. I just hop on.
But, officer, this is what he used as a shield!
Why was he blocking the Medieval lane?," isn't the real question, is it? The question is, why'd he turn his armor into an automobile
You tell me what it is, Officer. And no, I'm not riding a donkey!
Sir, I was in the designated jousting lane when the driver opened his door.
I had the right-a-way; he ran the STOP sign.
He was illegally parked in the war horse lane.
Sorry . . . it sure looked like a unicorn to me . . .
She just pulled right out in front of me.
No, the driver fell off a couple of blocks back.
We all have to do our part to fight climate change.
so much for horsepower, am I right...?
Seabiscuit drinks one too many
Sorry I thought you were a Windmill
What's this? Wait until the Marquis de Mercury hears of this!
I already told you, Officer. The cyclists hired me for protection, I am just doing my job.
...and he sped off, leaving the scene of the accident...
He yieldeth not, sir.
They said czar, not car.
I don’t know which horse it belongs to!
I think it's safe to say we can write this one off as an accident, right?
Can you believe this idiot was driving his car in the horse lane? So I jousted him...what’s the big deal?
Moving the Central Park carriage horses to traffic enforcement is a sweet revenge.
I TOLD him I had more horse power...
He mounted a most unusual steed.
When Speedy saw the checkered flag he ran right into the chase car.
It printeth no moreth, so I sthabbed it.
He wasn't respecting the joust lane
Con permiso, capped man. You can stick with your version of the facts if you choose, but I know a parked car when I see one, and this was no idle Chevy.
I  just didn't see the No Passing Zone sign
What's a stoplight?
Technically, it's not car-jacking, it was more of a car-jousting offense if you ask me.
But Officer, I had the right of way. Knight Rider ran the "Halt" sign.
Sir, I barely saw him in my spear-view mirror.
Yon Cavalier was indeed convertible.
How?” you ask. Why that’s what superior horsepower and thrust can do kind sir
Aye, 'twas a Charger.
I know he ran the light but it’s my job to pull him over
Forsooth officer, HE was the one who agreed he’d bring his mustang, and so...
I 'm sorry officer, I only meant to slash the tires.
Sir, he swore it was armor door!
A Renaissance Festival is no place for a Mustang.
I think your right I do need glasses.
It was an autonomous vehicle.
I thought I was in a joust. I had to defend myself.
But officer, it was disturbing the peace.
Were you looking for a 96 Corolla automatic windows?
Check my ass -- I don't think I was speeding, officer.
I really had no perception
I'm sure Mr. Musk has his reasons.
The driver was a real dork!
I hate Tesla's!
ee ae Lele) (La ag
“= tiktok.__.india
My apologies, officer. I was aiming for the window that is supposed to be lance-proof.
I know my name is Lancealot but it should have been Lanceanything.
I'm working my way up to a town car.
Officer, I swear I was in the bike lane
But officer, he cause the road rage by cutting me off in traffic
Let me guess...a Dodge Charger?
I'm not sure officer. I was in the jousting lane and next thing I know...
But Sir Officer, I loveth a martini up with a side of car!
”The motorist didn’t signal his turn.
Impaled for cause.  It's insignia falsely declared itself to be a Pinto.
I won the joust... I think.... His mount was just a colt... a Dodge Colt... and his insurance agent totaled it.
That war horse has weak shields.
Vision Zero does not apply.
It looks like a car door, but it is just a really big copier. And this guy was duplicating my screenplay."
He opened it in a driving lane.
I was tilting at windshields and missed. Why do you ask?
It was the King's Impala.
Officer, the vehicle was obviously driving on the wrong side of the road.
He got out of his car and yelled “get a horse”
Ok, you say you were playing charades and trying to act out ‘putting the cart before the horse’."
You say your name's Joustin' Bieber?
Officer, this is the Golden Door of Mambrino!
Now that's a horse of another blanket !
Calling one's steed 'Chivalry' is just begging for a joust, officer.
The Valiant badge on the trunk threw me off.
A mighty stallion indeed!
Forget to knock?
Because of cost cuts at the DMV, we’ve had to go low-tech in car inspections.
It's more to the point, than towing.
But  I'm Antifa, and I decided they are a facist, so you're not supposed to stop me from being violent!
I thought it was Sir Guy of Gimgh.
It's the same speed limit for any kind of horse power
But I successfully parallel parked between the two orange cones.
You joust driving a pinto and you lose!
Jousting lane or not, Sir Volvo had it coming.
The insurance companies can sort out fault.
If you gave us a protected lane we wouldn't have to fend for ourselves in the door zone.
Sorry officer, Elon Musk promised me this would never happen
To be honest I think it was a Mustang
Well sir, you see I was going along this narrow road to the deep north...when a cricket began to chirp inside my helmet
Well yes, I had three libations but that was at lunch.
He opened his door into the jousting lane
It had the power of a hundred and fifty horses.
He was on the  wrong side of  the list.
Saved from that beast upholstered in Corinthian leather!
Oh! I'm so sorry officer, I didn't know I wasn't allowed to have a bumper shorter than 22 inches.
The protective shield with glass does not meet street jousting safety laws.
I was riding in the knight lane when it flew open in front of me.
This is 'cause he forgot to fasten his seatbelt.
Please note the window was bulletproof, it was my only option.
But Nf3 was double parked!
Well, there was a car double-parked in the horse-lane!
Who sayest it's geometrically impossible!
Well, at least I wasn't riding my bicycle.
All hail to me, thane of car door!
I was just on my way to work when this car ran a red light.
‘hit and run’
I had to. The guys doubled dog dared me.
What is the best way to contact you e-mail or runner.
The Dutch Reach? Never heard of it.
Is that a door from a Plymouth Valiant?
So, about the registration...
Would you please take this car door off my lance.  It.1.1575680860.1575680770.edaa3584-18a1-4122-9b06-7a54ea741094
I captured his Knight Rider with my move to E3 on that giant chess board
I’m sorry officer, I think my brakes failed
HA! I have stabbed thy 'car door'!"
"Sir, I need you to get off the horse please.
Insurance for what?
Sorry that my lance is too short.
What can I say... Roan rage just took me over I guess!
'Pray thy pardon officer. I was going 15 miles an hour and this strange shield attacketh me"
It’s a funny story I’m planning to submit to the New Yorker when it’s done.
Yeah, but if I hadn't been speeding, I'd have skewered the idiot who threw this door open right in front of me!
I'm bringing the king his shish cabob.
He drove a made-for-America MG.Otherwise I would have murdered the driver.
But he was in the gore, not in the carriageway a'tall.
Never open your car door in the middle of a joust!
Look.  Can I help it if the guy opened his door in the middle of our joust?
But he thrust first, with Le Sabre.
Officer, sorry for the disturbance. We're just trying new things in the bedroom.
I was just trying to indicate.
I got sick and tired of those Back Seat Boys.
But officer, I thought the no-spearing rules weren't in effect on Sundays!
It only received Fox News.
He was clearly in the jousting lane.
He didn't Bow.
Let me be brief in your case.
But can you “prove” I made an illegal left turn?
I think the cannonball put a crack in it.
Officer, I thought it was a windmill.
Methinks I will ticket you for the offense of car door piercing, not-so-kind sir.
I'm guessing .... 1954 Studebaker.  Left front.  What's it look like to you?
But officer, he was stopped in the middle of the intersection.
Your taxi-meter setting does not comply with the latest regulations. . ."
I was only inquiring after the latest in horse shield.
Elon's orders, officer, I'm telling you!
It was only practice, officer.  No offense intended.
Officer, the horsepower was misleading.
My checkered donkey’s a unicorn.
Nothing to see here, Constable. Just a little get-tough trade policy.
Not everybody likes their martinis with olives.
It was an Dodge Lancer, not a cavalryman lancer. Who knew?
I thought his ancestral crest looked really plain, but it's OK, it turned out he was a Cadillac.
JOUST CHARGER ILL WRITE DOWN THE KINGS CROSSWORD
Is this an armored car?
When ink prices seem lunatic, who knows where madness lies
They told me he'd be riding a mustang.
You lose 10% as soon as you drive it to your first tournament.
I was sent by the king.
Jousting is a felony offence in this state plus you have damaged property while riding an unregistered vehicle
Is this Siena?
The idiot artist has no idea how hard this is
Someone called a cabriolet?
So,as I pierce the competitor's door with my lance,subtly referencing the antiquated,medieval design,you come out with a flourish - flames leaping and lasers flying,dressed like you're from the future- and throw steel balls at ours....
Sorry, sir. Just wondering if  it had any spare change. You know, for the world.
I was just riding along minding my own business and the car door opened without the driver looking.
I was told there was a "recall"  on the other knight's Armor.
It's my tug of war trophy.
My horse charged when I told him the car was a Mustang.
And I'm using the old "light" style....
This must be a Medieval 
happening
Please move aside kind Sir, the hand-to-hand combat must commence forthwith!
It’s possible I overreacted.  In my defense, he failed to yield.
Cant you see the irony, 300 hp and he loses
Ride share passengers never look when opening the door...
Just testing this new-fangled shield.
It said on the back, "Dodge Demon." I did and it swerved back towards me.
I was going against traffic.
He turned in front of me , I swear.
Vandalism? What about the damage to my lance?
The passenger side door is even worse...
Prince Harry XL, I caughteth thee traveling with the upmost renouncement of bravery in my hood.
I had to fight traffic, but I did get the checkered flag
YOU know––jousting n traffic."
An Amazon drone must have dropped it
The varlet shall make no further illegal lefts.
Thee killed thy steed, now step aside.
Perhaps we’re following different codes.
I honestly thought it was a giant
Giddyap, horsey!!
I’ll put out an all points bulletin to be on the lookout for a one door car.
The maniac didn't even bother to use his turn signal.
I saw this attacking a dancer so I lanced it.
Officer, It’s not my fault.... they blocked the box
It refused to grant my right of way.”
Don Dechman, Austin, T
That's nothing. He ran through a red light.
I was expecting the Dutch Reach.
No hit and runneth was I party to
They paid the list price.  They should have known better.
When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car.
Why are you busting my chops? It was parked in the jousting lane.
We ran a light.
He wouldn’t take me to Brooklyn.
I'm just as surprised as you are.
THEN our checker board became a horse...
Why would you do that.
One-door, one-horsepower vehicles still need to indicate off a roundabout.
I don't care how sharp that thing appears, I'm still giving you a ticket.
I'd say it's from a 1985 Dodge Lancer.
But, I've qualified for the semi-finals!
No one asked me about 'stop and lance' before I was running.
Officer Sir, amid the thicket;  after charge, all I heard was stick it
Officer, I'm not to blame if  Tesla doesn't know the difference between an open lane and my dear Butterscotch.
I told the damn fool to bring his jousting steed, not the Mustang!
This is the foul weaponry of the four-wheeled warrior against the two-wheeled warrior and those walking.
I told him it was my parking space.
So its my fault he chose to parallel park along the jousting lane.
I’d say our horsepower was just about even.
Gimme a break Officer, this knight driving is like a stab in the dark!
I saw an attacker in, I guess, the car window. How can you ticket me for defending myself!
At least Don Quijote had home insurance.
You call this a moving violation?? Surely you joust, sir! I'm merely scrapping this for replacement armor!
There's no parking at knight.
I could not help myself! He was riding a Mustang.
You may address me as RFRD2017Volvo.
‘I do it to reassure Blaze. She has anxiety issues
Sorry. Did I just vandalize your car?" "No, I'm just looking for ideas."
I have a profound passion for my work, officer.
My charger bested his charger.
It’s not my fault officer, I got doored.
The car driver is receiving a ticket for opening the door without looking in the rear mirror first.
Just think I could have gotten my finger caught in  the door instead of my thingie
He opened his door and I was in the bike lane.
But officer, i was expecting someone from your mounted patrol when instead this patrol car came charging at me
C'mmon, wake up, it's the 15th century...have you heard of emails?
It was "Blocking the Box", Officer.
Tell it to the judge, Sir Lance a Fiat.
I proclaim thee Sir Jack Mehoff, and I present you with your very own Glory Hole.
I know it is a moving violation but it just presented itself.
Ofcourse he crashed. I attacked from the backside.
Where I. One from, shields are a lot tougher
I offer this crown of roses, my fair maiden.  Will you favor me as your betrothed?
It was a simple fender bender until..." --Gerard Black Laurelton,        NY
I'm going to have to charge you with possession of an unregistered automatic.
Just testing Tesla's new product
I was in the bike lane when he opened his door, officer.
I Triumphed over the Stag.
He didn't signal before making a right turn in front of the jousting lane. What was I supposed to do?
So I told him, "It's not my fault this armor plating is not original manufacturer's equipment."
Can I park in a Compact Car Only parking space, Now!
I thought the price was just too good.
Seriously man? All because I forgot my cooler?
Sir, please stop horsing around.
If you really wanted dead all I'd have to do is stop patrolling your neighbors
No, this is not my first head-on collision.
Yes, "Tilting at Toyotas" is a catchy name for it but it's still illegal.
I'm sorry sir, but this constitutes joust cause.
Officer what can I say, the other guy didn’t have enough horse power”
Why should I get the ticket? He's the one who lost the joust!
Jouster: Tis but a scratch
Officer: A Scratch?! The door is off
Jouster: No it isn't
I'm from the Grand Dutchy of Fenwick, and claim knightly immunity.
I'm just trying to find Baby Yoda
First, he was driving in the Knight Lane, and second, he wouldn’t let me pass him.
Officer, the car model was a Lancer. Appropriate don't you think: "a lance for a Lancer!"
It's just a little token for Dulcinea.
Well, he was talking on his cell phone while driving.
Lancing and Registration, please.
The other Knight charged me on a steel horse, Officer!
In my defense, he was blocking the box.
No Constable, I do not have insurance.
Officer,I was going to the Medieval Fair but ended up at Nascar.
The label said it was a Charger.
So what if its the door from Knight Rider.
He aimed first!
David Hyde who?
It's not my fault, officer. The car thought it could fly like Dumbo.
Officer, I've got a costume party next Friday. There's been a promise of  fondu. How else can I practice?
Because that chariot most foule
wast made by the Chinee!
I thought having a door would make it easier to get on the horse.
'Twas a fair fight, sir. My steed against his Mustang!
In the olden days we would burn women like you at the stake, you should be happy with a fine that will put you and your kids out of your home, that what you get for not conforming.
He was parked in the bike lane.
So, you said  it was dark when the accident happened? Okay, knight rider.
I was hungry.  I thought it was a hot dog vendor.
I forgot my keys in there, sire
He was double-parked and opened it right in front of me. How is that my fault?
It was spinning like a windmill!
But I didn't know it was on the endangered species list.
By natural law I shouldn't be able to hold this with one arm. The driver was honking at my pet aardvark and I wasn't having it! Have you seen my horse? Oh, wait, she's under me. So, how long have you worked at the mall?  Burp! I'm a knight!
He came in sideways ... Not legal.
He was in the horse lane.
OK. I won't ride on the sidewalk again.
I never get these New Yorker cartoons either.
There's no way this was a moving violation!
There,  The printer is not mightier than the lance.
With all due respect constable, this is how we signal a right hand turn where I come from
Musk told me to.
It was not 'road rage,' officer--It was Honor Rage!
Officer please don't ticket -we were so close to finding the golden car grille
That's what I get for jousting with a Honda.
Darn this early onset Dimentia, I was sure it was another guy on a horse!
...But my opponent spruiked thine horse's power!
Do you know how fast you were galloping?
I was in the bike lane, officer.
From a distance it looked like a windmill. Sue me.
He pulled right in front of me, and I couldn't stop!
It was supposed to be stainless!
Tilt at windmills, not windows next time
Officer, taxi travel was just simply too slow in this holiday traffic, traveling by horse is much quicker. The taxi drove away and my foil foiled the driver's day for sure.
Never joust with an Uber driver?
You're giving me a ticket just for jousting with cars? It's not like anyone actually got hurt.
Soldier: I have to report this situation officer. These shields are penetrable in one go. Would you mind changing them? Are we not living in modern world, better solution?
Officer (Thinking): Oh Tesla! Not in front of the medieval soldier.
This shield  was proved weak a long time ago
To be fair, my liege, it WAS a Cybertruck.
Okay, Sarge, maybe I should’ve just written him a ticket.
Some guy said, “ Hey Armor All guy, do my Charger.”
Constable, tell Hizzoner I caught the rascal on 14th Street."
Excuse me officer, I don't know what the issue is here, but this is my dinner, and I have a deadline to meet
No, it's just a visual reminder to stay out of my lane..
You said, "Give me the fax - just the fax"
I swear, we were only practicing our Terre à Terre!
These jousting lanes just aren't safe.
But he waved me through.
I swear he came out of nowhere.
You see, my spouse ousted me for a faustian bargain made jousting with Justin Bieber, which roust my wife, doused my marriage, arousing my ire. So, I tried to joust with my wife's tires to demount her, but I missed, causing this rout... simply put.
A very unusual shield, don't you think?
Well, officer, I know you have heard of road rage, now this is an example of joust rage, as this vehicle clearly does not fit in with the Renaissance Fair "Middle Ages" theme.
A Knight’s Fee for travel on such dangerous trails.
But we were challenged by some guy 
in a motorized Mustang
I don't take checks, but you can Venmo me for "slaying the beast."
A clear case of dooring, officer.
Slow down — and start with the century.
Behold...a horse without blinders.
Things were going swimmingly until about 9 o'clock this morning.
Perhaps, I  mistook the parking lot for a jousting course.
Now when dispatch said there'd been an accident involving a Mitsubishi Lancer....

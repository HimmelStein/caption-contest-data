Meet Trump's nominee for the Centers for Disease Control.
Mike, Barbara--I'd like to introduce you to President Trump's new pick to head the Centers for Disease Control.
So are you are just in town for the summer?
Oh, perfect - we're WASPs!
So you're the bug that's been going around.
I told you I was dating a blood sucking parasite.  You just assumed it was a lawyer.
Where we disagree is that exposed skin implies consent.
We met camping
Tell them what happened in the lab, Harry.
The females bite. The males drink.
"Hope you don't mind my crashing the party, I saw the porch light on."
So, long story short, one night I left the porch light on and we’ve been in love ever since.
He wasn’t invited, but I left the light on.
Bob identifies as a mosquito.
Thanks to Bob, the only thing my husband got in the divorce was malaria."
Let me introduce you to a host
Crazy story - we met when Steve hit my windshield.
Can I get you a glass of standing water?
Bill, please explain to the Dorfmans why you find that blue light they put up so offensive.
I'm sorry. I ordered a mojito, not a mosquito.
A couple of these and he’ll be flying into light bulbs.
There’s a hole in your screen door
He just was so persistent. The first night, I couldn't keep him off me!
Paula and Jim are work friends, and Dave here just came through the hole in the screen door.
And I'm sure you remember Joe from our camping trip last summer.
Excuse me while I go and shut the screen door.
No, I asked for a Large Mojito.
Poor thing's homeless now that Trump's draining the swamp
Are you just here for the summer?
What a coincidence—Bob and Mary summer upstate, too!
I'm sorry, but I can never remember which disease it is that you transmit.
He says he likes wine but prefers standing water.
I'm sorry!  I just have an inexplicable urge to slap you.
And Henry here is a real parasite. I’m kidding — he's an attorney.
And this is Fred; he’s renting our pond for the summer.
So, are you here just for the season?
I was walking through the park and he just wouldn’t leave me alone...anyway it’ll be three years in March.
And one of his latest projects just completely went viral.
Allow me to introduce you to my divorce attorney.
I guess we're all hosts at this party.
So what are your plans now that they've drained the swamp?
Devin and I went to the same summer camp.
Who are you drinking?
Who would have thought an 8th grade science fair project could go so wrong?
Honey, you remember Mary and Neil from the barbecue last summer.
The Nussbaums?  O negative and AB positive.  Why do you ask?
I brushed him off for most of the summer but then,one day,I just gave in.
He says you're both excellent hosts.
You have a lot in common. John and Kate are tax attorneys.
Well, just who IS your type, Roger?
And of course you know Bill and Amy from their work at the CDC.
And you both remember Melvin, from when Bob left the screen door open.
Bob has a different view on draining the swamp.
Apologies again about the citronella candle.
Yes dear, I realize you’re trapped in a grotesque Kafkaesque nightmare that’s oppressing you with a profound dread of the utter meaninglessness of human existence--but you’re still our designated driver.
Since Harold and I met,
I'm feeling loved, cherished, and slightly anemic.
Yes, Frank does have a tendency to suck the life out of a party.
Lawyer? No, I meant I'm literally a bloodsucker.
Nonsense! You two have a lot in common; you're a lawyer and she's a blood-sucking parasite.
Allow me to introduce my husband and his girlfriend —
Bob, Sheila: my attorney.
Yes, I suppose we do all suck in our own way.
First he stole my blood, then he stole my heart.
And Bob has kindly volunteered to run the blood drive this year.
So it's fair to say I'm not the only host here tonight.
Now I remember! We were at summer camp together.
Won't you stay for a bite?
For tonight’s tasting we have Josh and Emily from the Bronx, a delightful pairing of AB- and O+ with just a hint of anti-depressants.”
This is Doug. He’s from that old tire in your yard.
Our chemistry is good, but he does get under my skin.
and then I said,Kafka,schmafka...
Personally, I'm glad he didn't drain the swamp.
And this is Bob, my divorce lawyer.
That’s why Zika, here, is against draining the swamp.
Will you be staying for a bite?
This is Victor. He's a vector.
I’m sorry to dissappoint you but I asked for a mojito, not mosquito.
And then we realized that I was his type!
Meet Bob and Jen, the two AB positives I was raving about earlier.
Meet Buzz. His family has been coming to the Hamptons every summer for two centuries.
I do hope you'll interpret my role as 'host' figuratively.
Carl, I’d like you to meet Henry and Tina; they’re the 0-positives I was telling you about.
The swamp has been very good to him during this administration.
Oh, no, I said "mojito."
I'd like you two to meet Harry. He's way better than that leech I was dating last year.
He is sort of a pest, but I love him.
Everyone, this is Herb.  Our kids attended summer camp together.
So apparently the swamp isn't drained.
So, I picked up this bug while traveling...
I think we can all agree that politics and rolled-up newspapers are off limits tonight.
He has a way of getting under your skin.
Can I get you something more stagnant?
No matter what, do not let his glass go empty.
I'd like to introduce you to my emotional support animal.
Bob and Linda, I'd like you to meet my divorce attorney.
I told them I really don't like mojitos. What did you think I said?
At first I thought he was a prick.
I believe you've met the Jensens, didn't you give them malaria last summer?
Congratulations on your appointment as head of the President's Special Commission on Draining the Swamp
I’m B negative. Why?
We met while camping.
So, Dale, Sandy tells me you grew up in a stagnant pond.
I think you'll like Keith and Sheila, they're both O Positive.
We met in the Peace Corps.
And how long did you work for Monsanto?
Jim, these are the anti-vaxers I told you about.
I believe you’ve bit the Murphys...
We locked eyes through the screen door and I just knew I had to let him in.
O-negative.  Why?
Now tell us why you prefer some of us over others.
Of course you can join us. We won't bite.
This is Harry, but talk fast. His life expectancy won’t make it past dessert.
I’m AB Negative. Why do you ask?
No, I said large Mojito.
Single donor, O-neg, recent vintage -- I think you'll like it.
I'd like to introduce you to your hosts.
Guys, he’s kidding. It’s just Merlot.
Margaret, here, had 92 children yesterday.
We first met at summer camp.
We were on an African safari and Harry here tells the witch doctor that he thinks he’s a fraud.
Joe is a lawyer, so you two probably have a lot in common.
He's more outgoing around standing water.
Meet my emotional support animal.
Niles, these are my friends from the World Health Organization I told you about.
Yes, I'm a mosquito and I 'll have a Bloody Mary. By the way, which one of you is Mary?
Burt and Isabel work for the IRS. You should have a lot in common.
Arnold, show them the mating dance that won me over.
Small world. Brent and Rachel here just recovered from malaria.
M’lady? M’lord? M’laria.
...mostly sting operations
Well, I typed "stinger" when I meant to type "swinger" and the rest is history.
Gee, we didn’t think you were coming.  I just sprayed the yard.
It was a beautiful summer day, and we just connected.
Paul and Betty, this is my emotional support insect, Dwight.
We're all lawyers here, right?
He's Amazon's biggest carrier.
So, where does everyone summer?
Frank is very active in the anti-pesticide movement.
I said, “bring me a big mojito, not mosquito”
You remember the Johnsons, dear--you bit them last summer.
Interesting red! Anyone I know?
He’s lobbying the President not to drain the swamp.
An old hubcap full of stale rainwater, but we usually just tell people Charleston, South Carolina to keep it regional, right honey?
He won't admit it,but when we first met I could tell right away that he was attracted to me.
We met through the net.
He was just saying there’s never any new blood at these parties.
He's fine until he's had a few, then he might get a bit tsetse.
I'm getting hints of iron, hemoglobin and nitrogen...
We met at a Kafka reading
Only the females suck blood. Trevor sucks Pinot Noir, don’t you Trev?
I met him on the web.
....and the Burkharts are the anti-vaxers I was telling you about!
Here are the hosts.
Let me introduce you to the Bermans, who already gave at the Red Cross.
Joe, I'd like you to meet Tom and Sharon.  He's O-positive and she's A-negative.
You should meet my ex-husband. He's a prick too.
When you said your husband was a bloodsucker I thought you meant he was a lawyer,
I've tried them all, but Type O goes with everything!
I saved him from a bug zapper and one thing led to another.
Well...let's just agree to disagree about DEET, shall we?
He becomes such a pest when he drinks.
Yes, I think it's fair to say Kafka had an influence on my life.
Yes, yes it is definitely type O.  Now drink it before it clots.
Sarah and Allan, this is my divorce lawyer.
And what are your summer plans?
We actually met at a backyard patio party
I'm O positive, why do you ask?
I suck at cocktail parties
Tom really knows how to suck the life out of the party.
I believe you met last year at the lake.
Managing the work/life balance with 5,000 kids sounds like a challenge.
I forgot that “repellent” is a trigger word.  I should've said “unpleasant.”
We met last summer in Florida.
John tells me you're into camping.
You're right, a proboscis is more eco-friendly than a plastic drinking straw.
This is the couple I was telling you about. You’re going to absolutely love them. Tom is AB and Cassandra is type O.
I traded one bloodsucker for another, but at least this one is honest about it.
Thanks again for getting that stubborn cork out of the bottle.
Why don't you tell them about your trip to the west nile, dear?
I assumed you were making a joke about being in high finance when you said blood sucking parasite.
Actually,it’s Moscato.
We met through our DNA match.
You should have met my first husband, he was a bloodsucking lawyer.
No, I haven’t read Kafka. Why do you ask?
I  think we can all agree that Rob has a point.
Mike is originally from the stagnant pond out back.
We're really looking forward to seeing you in Minnesota this summer.
What drew you to the neighborhood?
She’s bleeding me dry, but she’s the best divorce lawyer in town.
I'd like you to meet Peter and Susan.  They are B positive and O negative .
Tell them, dear, how you got involved in the anti-pesticide movement.
We met at a picnic.
We've made it work through years of therapy and a vat of calamine lotion.
When I eventually get sick of him, I'll just smack him with a magazine.
Our ancestors worked on the Panama Canal too.
I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for a bite.
We're so grateful that you're willing to help out with the blood drive!
I can honestly say that there is a sucker born every minute.
These are my good friends Bill and Laura.
They are also lawyers.
'Type A, why do you ask?'
Unbelievable! She tried to slap you for just showing up??
This is my husband, Greg. He works with infectious diseases.
If ypu don’t mind me asking... what’s your stance on immunization?
Tom here works on our viral marketing team.
George, this is Dan and Liz with the standing water problem I was telling you about.
Mike and I met on my African cruise
You know my last marriage to a whiny, blood-sucking parasite didn’t end well, so I figured this time, I’d go for the real thing.
You both have something in common. Jill here is a phlebotomist.
Are we all having the same inebriated illusion or is it my unemployed bloodsucking ex-husband Bob?
What I said was, "I have no tolerance for MOJITOS."
What are the odds? They're also lawyers.
The Millers are bloodsuckers too: leveraged buyouts.
What a coincidence - you're a blood-sucking parasite, and Mr. Cohen here, used to be an attorney
This is my husband. He can be quite a prick.
No, I'm from Southampton, but I have a winter home in West Nile.
Small world! Bob and Nancy's foundation works with malaria victims too!
'This is Dave, he's with us for the summer.'
Babe, tell them about that time with the light bulb.
Until that ancestry test I had no idea we were all related.
Try not to suck the life out of the party.
He prefers ‘hemoglobin connoisseur’ to ‘dirty, stinking bloodsucker’.
These are the other pests I was telling you about.
And Larry here does something or other at BuzzFeed.
Todd is a lawyer too.
Tell them your dengue fever story, dear.
I’d like to introduce you to Mia. She’d be glad to check your blood alcohol level before you drive home tonight.
There are those who claim to understand Kafka ... and then there’s my friend here, Gregor.
Speaking of the West Side, Ed here is from the West Nile.
Tomato, tomahto, mosquito, moscato.
Or I have a nice O negative if you prefer.
It's an O positive, 1984.
We ordered a Mojito not a mosquito.
That whole Lyme disease thing?  Fake news.
I was just telling them about the night you first bit me.
Yes, I am the host.  Why do you ask?
Yes, I'd love to go out for a bite.
I met him at a Kafka reading.
If you want to find the best pools of standing water, Jenna here is the one to ask.
What do you mean your job sucks, Steve?
Speaking of bloodsucking lawyers, have you met my divorce attorney?
Here's to a good buzz.
What a coincidence!  Bob's also in the business of sucking blood from innocent victims.
George, the Harrisons want to apologize for spraying you with DEET yesterday.
This is awkward. The Johnsons just bought an Orkin franchise...”
Type O. But, why do you ask?
That whole “Drain the swamp” thing” never came true, so Bob and I will be moving back to D.C. soon.
We met on a camping trip ...
He didn't start drinking til the neighbors got a bug zapper.
A positive. Why?
They've been itching to meet you.
Let me guess, you're a lawyer.
That proboscis must come in handy, now that they've outlawed plastic straws.
These are my ex-husband and his new wife. They are also blood-suckers.
Well, we are going to have just agree to disagree on the scourge of Citronella.
He says he believes he met you at a barbeque last summer.
And this is Tom and Jane. They are both Type O.
A life span of 10 days? And I would have sworn we met at the Hamptons last summer.
Oh, Martin. Stop being such a pest!
Actually, the first time we met was when I spotted him in the corner of my shower, wasn't it honey?
You just have to suck it up, am I right?
They think they met you last summer in Maine.
Harold, Lisa, meet Brad, our new temp employee. Such a shame he’ll be with us only 76 hours.
My apologies, but our invitation actually said we were having a big MESQUITE  barbecue party.
Actually, we met at the Blood Drive.
Well now, THAT'S a stinger!
Yes, most people guess lawyer, but I'm actually a phlebotomist.
It's a 2017 AB-Negative. Quite rare, actually.
We met at a flea market in Chernobyl.
We met on the web.
I asked for a Mojito, not a mosquito.
But we're ALL lawyers, you fit right in.
This is my husband. He’s a bit of a pest.
Buzz works in infectious diseases.
And Dan is a divorce lawyer, so really you’re both giant, blood-sucking parasites!
Oh, he's harmless - only the females bite.
We actually met at the company picnic last year.
We hear that the buzz about your West Nile trip just went viral.
A phlebotomist! How interesting!
Is somebody wearing DEET?
And after drinks, we'll have a little bite.
Now, I think we can agree to disagree on draining the swamp.
Larry here loves a warm, full-bodied red.
Robert, tell the Johnsons about your recent trip to Chernobyl.
What a small world, the Joneses are also from Florida.
... and I thought “Why not?” and swiped right. So meet Lawrence.
Phil, I’d like you to meet the rest of the swat team.
No, I distinctly remember ordering a grasshopper!
And she has hundreds of sons about the same age as your daughter.
And so I said, 'that's not a parasite, that's my husband!'
...and this is my parasite of an ex-husband who just decided to show up uninvited, as usual.
And this is Kevin. He sucks.
No, we were talking about Melania, not malaria.
Wow, the three of you really do have something in common...Marci's a phlebotomist and Dave's an attorney....
Your stories about traveling abroad are infectious.
Cheryl, I'd like you to meet the new donors.
Joe here was just telling me about his work with the Gates Foundation's malaria project.
The Connors are going camping next week, I thought you should meet first.
So I said, “Bartender, I need a giant mojito!”
Roger and Linda here work in debugging software. No offense.”
Once you get to know him, he's not such a pest.
I heard you were back in town for the summer.
So I hear you come from the West Nile
Have you met our hosts?
Meet my husband. He is a lawyer, too.
O-positive. Why do you ask?
And if it doesn’t work out, he’ll be dead in three weeks anyway.
These two are bloodsucking lawyers, so you'll get along just fine.
Oh my gosh, small world!  I swatted your cousin!
We met in Florida.
Oh yeah? And what makes you such an expert on Kafka?
I meant bloodsucking liberal as a term of endearment
I'm so sorry. I don't know why I slapped you.
Have you met the Orkins?
We met at camp.
Let me introduce Bob and Shelly.  He's an O-positive, but she's one of those rare AB-negatives.
Meet tonight's protagonist, he got in through a hole in the screening process.
I'm so pleased that Fox News gave you the evening off
Tell us about the West Nile.
That's so interesting! Mark here was also just in Africa.
And this is my cousin Malaria.
How much do we have to drink for this to feel normal?
May I present your hosts?
And this is our new neighbor,Ted. He just moved here from the West Nile.
How terribly dreadful...only seven days?
So, Frank tells me you studied hematology?
So now you've tried the blood sample, can you guess which one of us it is?
Of course,  we'll be using a surrogate.
...and he's a brilliant fundraiser. He could get blood from a stone!
These are the Wagners. They will be your dinner tonight.
I'll just let you anti-vaxers get to know eachother!
I met him at the IRS office
We met on an Amazon cruise.
I'm afraid Bob here is a bit of a snob when it comes to reds.
Actually, we met on the net.
We first met at our daughter's outdoor wedding last summer.
The Zika virus? Really, that was you?!
He's more exotic and certainly more social than my first husband.
He visited our campsite in Maine.  We adopted him.
Tim, meet Harry and Julia— they’ll be your hosts next week.
He’s great company as long as he doesn’t get too attached
Yes, John, we all know how strongly you feel about pesticides.
Why as a matter of fact, I do know Jeff Goldblum
So do you all have malaria? Or is that just a stereotype?
Oh that?, it's just some bug going around.
"Skeeter was telling me about his party trick, determining your blood type for free."
I think we can all agree with the PC crowd that “pesticide” is a pretty insensitive term and that “insecticide” is preferable.
He does have a point.
We actually ordered a giant Moscato.
You might be interested to know that the Jones' are both universal donors.
Meet the new head of our malaria lab.
So, Professor.  What other effects of global warming have you studied?
You got through screening.
You'll love this one - What is the last thing to go through a bug's mind when it hits your windshield?
Congrats! We heard you went viral.
We didn't meet on the Net. We met in the net.
Why must you always B-Negative?
We just found out we're related by blood.
You look like you’re about to get smashed.
Is there a reason you all are wearing long sleeves on this hot day?
We met that summer I spent in Minnesota.
The Smiths here say they’re related to you by blood.
He’s less a global warming denier and more of a global warming advocate.
We discovered a taste for each other last summer.
And this is my divorce lawyer...
"Well, look on the bright side. At least they didn't drain the swamp."
I brought him so people wouldn't bring up the elephant in the room.
She's just here for the season.
Frank and Rachel are lobbyists, so you all have a lot in common.
Cheer up, there's never been a better time to be a blood sucking parasite.
I just assumed you'd want something red.
I'd say he's more of a gadfly
I'm sorry -- I just assumed you would want red.
I’m really sorry about the patio, I distinctly told George not to spray.
Why yes, he is the host.
Oh calm down, Murray, he calls all attorneys blood suckers.
She just flew in from South America for that Zika conference.
Mojito!  I asked for a mojito!
Drain the swamp? Who’s kidding whom?
So how are the larvae?
This is my husband and the children are buzzing around here somewhere.
Speaking of trips, tell them all about your love for the West Nile.
We both like the outdoors, and we both HATE spiders.
Well, actually, Ted and I met at an entomology seminar at Yale.
He was looking for a mate before he dies tomorrow, and I was looking for some quick rebound sex.
My last boyfriend was a lawyer too!
Peter, Linda, I'd like you to meet our most annoying guest.
He was appointed as acting Secretary of the Interior to drain the swamp.
These are the O'Negatives. I heard the were just your type."
Have you guys met my Lawyer?
Would you rather have a Stinger?
Bill and Erika also summer in Montauk!
Skeeter..That's your last one..You're flying home tonight''
And this is Janet... We met on a cruise up the Amazon last year!
Why, yes, we all work at the blood bank. Are you also in the industry?
So Dan, I hear you were a bloodsucking pest before you even joined us here at the I.R.S.
'Oliver was just telling me about his 30 000 lovely children.'
He had me at "you're my type".
Have you met Joyce? She's malarious.
Frank was just explaining how he eradicated an entire African village with yellow fever.
I mean,once you start with genetic modifications,it's so hard to know where to stop. Am I right,Edward?
Thank god for Stu. My last boyfriend was a leach.
Larry and I used to date, but I just wasn't his blood type.
He's a rescue.
Preston's organized our community blood drive.
Randy, dear. Have you met the Citronellas yet?
He's attracted to Type A people.
And Mos, you remember the Campbell's? The B - / AB + couple?
And what law firm do you work for?
Dear thing, if your lifespan ends in two hours we can certainly bring out the appetizers now.
That's so funny, the Johnsons just got back from the West Nile.
Jeffrey says that it was my skin that first attracted him, wasn't it darling?
Let me introduce you to our bartender. In addition to serving drinks, he'll be monitoring everyone's blood alcohol level.
I finally said to myself: Don't I deserve someone like Bill here who would appreciate every square inch of me?
He was so attracted to me
Can I get you someone else to drink?
We met on my trip to the West Nile and have been together since.
Why are you three dressed as humans?
I'd like you to meet your host.
Where do we summer?  Why do you ask?
So, you detect notes of blood group O, Rh positive.
If only he sucked fat.
No, no.  I asked for a moJito!
I said mojito, not mosquito!
Now that metamorphosis is complete, he is allowed to drink.
Ha-ha, I get it, not into small talk- 26 hour lifespan and all.
Is there a particular vintage you prefer? Perhaps a nice Millennial?
And Fred is a phlebotomist. You two should talk.
Meet the cause of my seven-year itch.
I’d like you to meet my comfort mosquito
Seriously. Bite me.
Oh, I'm a sucker for a Bloody Mary, too.
He says I'm exactly his type. O positive.
Lovely name, Anopheles. Is is Greek?
I'd like you both to meet Ted. He's also a bloodsucking lawyer.
I hope you like it. It’s a rare 2017 AB negative.
And then I just slapped him. Needless to say, that was the end of our relationship.
I usually like a red with more body.
I don't care if you are picking up subtle notes of Deet, just drink the damn wine.
Nobody ever "invites" me to a party.  They just assume I'll show up.
This is Bernie. He is from the Upper West Nile.
The Franklins have been itching to meet you.
Some of my best friends are parasitic blood-suckers.
I hope you're not flying tonight.
And here's Bob from Goldman Sachs.
...and, as the new Director, you're uniquely qualified to bring some new blood into the CDC.
Honey, these are the wasps I’ve been telling you all about
He doesn't bark or shed, but he really scares the hell out of the mail man.
O negative 2003? Excellent choice!
How long have you been a lawyer?
Buzz, here, is an admitted social parasite.
Sorry, I just assumed you’d want the red.
No more dear, your’re buzzed!
Fred works undercover for the EPA.
We met under the porch light.
George and I met at the malaria conference, what about you two?
Personally I can’t stand B+ - give me a nice glass of O- on a muggy summer night and I’m set.
So then I said, 'bite me,' ... Oh, wait.
I'm doing better than ever, It wouldn't be the same in D.C. if he actually drained the swamp
Don’t be ridiculous, Sidney. Of course the Petersons don’t smell like DEET.
Bert has always been quite the Kafka fan.
You have a lot in common—the Johnsons are both lawyers.
No, I ordered a MOJITO!
I asked for a Large Mojito, not a Large Mosquito!
Well at least you’re not a lawyer!
So the Witch Doctor got angry.  What happened next?
These parties always suck the life out of me
May I offer you a bite?
No, I am NOT your type!
Can I get you more stagnant water?"
Yes, everyone thinks when I talk about 'my husband the bloodsucker' I'm speaking metaphorically, but as you can see...
None of the repellents were working, he kept on hanging around and the rest is history."
I thought I ordered a grasshopper.
Well, I was tired of always having an elephant in the room...
Would you prefer a Scotch with standing water?
So I said, "Mosquito, Moscato. Tomato, tomatoe".
It's called a grasshopper. I bet you'd like it.
Moss, you remember Bill? You bit him at our Fourth of July barbecue last summer.
I think Harold here has some thoughts on the benefits of climate change.
Dr. Zika has come to speak about West Nile virus
Anna, this is Bill and Mel. They’ll be your hosts for this evening.
I believe you both have some Irish blood in you.
You sure you're okay to fly?  You seem buzzed.
Having your own reusable straw is so "in".
And then I said, "Swatter? I barely knew her!"
It's a 1993 O positive
And Bob here is literally a blood sucking lawyer.
We met last summer in Alaska.
They remember you from their Peace Corps days
Gary's head of Infectious Diseases at the CDC, aren't you Gar?
Thanks, but I'll just stick with the O Positive.
And this is my husband, Herb.  He's a lobbyist.
John’s taken his love of Kafka too far this time.
We met a blood bank. I was giving, he was taking.
You look like you're ready for a bite.
He just kind of got under my skin.
You know Jeff Goldblum, don't you?
We were just talking about how big the mosquitoes were in the Hamptons this year.
How long have you worked at the IRS?
I Don’t know about you guys but I already feel a buzz!
They’re just wondering who left the screen open.
Pay no attention to Herb.  One glass of wine and he bugs everybody.
I'm partial to full-bodied reds.
What a coincidence. Anopheles was my maiden name.
Whereas Jeremy prefers a full-bodied red...
Oh, it’s AB-negative. 
Hard to find. 
I’m glad you like it.
I’m all out of  B positive but this is a very rare AB negative , enjoy!
It’s actually my favorite, an O-negative from 2012
Personally, I think Kafka ment it as metaphor, but I can see where you're coming from.
We met on safari.
So you keep your blood alcohol level in check by drinking blood and alcohol at the same time!  Genius!
Frankly, I don’t think anyone should be defined by the number of their legs.
Unfortunately, his friendship is only skin deep.
And that's when he said, 'malaria? I  hardly know her!'
Don’t be alarmed.  Only females need blood.  Males prefer a nice Cab.
Well, he was a little prick when he was younger, but we've all evolved…
He likes his a little more full bodied.
No.  He's from the EAST Nile.
And of course you know Bob and Betty from last summer in the Hamptons.
Don’t mind Martin.  He gets a little annoying when he’s buzzed.
And there's a whole magnum of A negative where that came from.

I always feel drained after these events.
I hear you created quite a buzz over by the pool.

Have you read Metamorphosis?
To be honest, the job sucks.
Mom, Dad, I'd like to introduce my new boyfriend, Malcolm. Most people call him Skeeter.
Well, yes, climate change might actually be beneficial for some species.
Life was good before he drained the swamp
Bloody Mary for you?
You all met last summer, I believe.
We've been itching to see you!
This is the bloodsucker I was telling you about.

He was a baby when we found him in an amber necklace.
This is Wes, Wes Nile.  He just flew into town.
This is Gly. He did top-secret research for Monsanto.
Ever since that report on pesticides, I only drink organic wines.

Jerome just flew in from the tropics.
Excellent point.
Bill just isn’t himself when he drinks.
Apparently since biting a few drinkers, I’m now an alcoholic.
I see you're drinking B negative..that's hard to find!
O negative. Why do you ask?
No,you can't have a sip of my drink. Because it's never just a "sip".

Corporate Lobbyist.

Must you always be such a pest?
Harold bit on me at the company picnic.
We used to have an elephant in this room
Barney here is the new head of the phlebotomy department.

Your from West Nile ?

The O positive has a very nice floral bouquet.

Are you sure this is wine?"
"Oh, positive.

That's an excellent point.
Dev and Reyna are just itching to meet you!
Don't be silly! Why would someone spike your drink with DDT?

We met while I was serving in the Peace Corps, and we've been together ever since!
And how is the West Nile this season?
Certainly we were shocked when the accident at the lab turned Scott into a 6-foot blood-sucking freak.  On the plus side, the neighborhood seems so much quieter after dusk.
I think it's far more important that we can have a respectful conversation than worrying about whose blood is in the glass and how it got there.
The hostess with the "mostess", meet the mosquito with the mojito.
What do you mean it's in your nature to stick your nose in other peoples' business?

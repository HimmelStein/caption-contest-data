I know, but unfortunately we are still required to have one human on the board.
First things first:  you can’t eat Joe, our new diversity hire.
I'm all for diversity in the boardroom, but bringing in a middle-aged white guy is a bit over the top...
We 're calling it the "corporate lobbyist". Sure, it's not as flashy and instantaneous as the gamma pulse death ray, but the R&D guys downstairs assure us it will be far more destructive.
I know it looks uncomfortable, but it's just for the congressional hearing.
Our new intern Bob is a "vegetarian."  
That means that he doesn't taste like meat.

Yes, he's scary-looking. But let's not prejudge.

Nice costume, Fred. Where'd you find the tie?
You'll trust me when I say he's loathsome where it counts.
The winner of this years "Scariest Costume" contest is Bill, who came cleverly disguised as a staunch Republican!

We had a good run, Ted, but I simply don’t have the counter space.
You're really nice; I just don't have the counter space.
Remember when your rubber seal broke? I'm pregnant.
What turns you off?
Just so you know, I’m also dating Mr. Coffee.
Why do you have to process everything little thing I say?
So where exactly is Hamilton Beach?
Mother says I'd date anyone with a pulse.
Just give me a minute to process this.
George, I have something to tell you.  I've met a toaster.
So, how long have you identified as transblender?
Actually, I have a very good reason for thinking the baby's yours."
It's my own fault. I did say I'd date anyone with a pulse.
I'll wait a moment while you process that.
Why do you have to process everything?
Please do not use that speed with me, Wendell.
Must we process everything, Doug?
You have some spinach stuck in your blades.
Honey, use your indoor speed
Don’t look at me.  I told you to save the instructions.
Well, I did say I'd go for any man with a pulse...
So... no attachments?
So glad they had a table by the outlet.
The last guy I dated was a pot head.
Is that a no, or are you still processing?
It's very hard for me to avoid pushing your buttons.
I'm at the point where I'll date anyone with a pulse.
I don’t think anyone will notice you’re not wearing a tie.
Please tell me you still have your third wish left.
I can see you need a minute to process that.
Well, it's just really hard not to push your buttons.
I’ve done speed dating, but this is my first mixer.
I can't believe your ancestors were Shakers.
Oh, when you said you lived in Hamilton Beach, I thought you meant in Queens.
I'm sorry I don't turn you on anymore, John.
At this point I am just looking for a man with a pulse
I'm leaving, John. I realize it may take you some time to process this.
I'm sorry, this is just a lot to process.
For goodness sake, Marvin, must you always mince my words?
I saw the way you looked at that pepper mill.
This is just a lot to process.
Before we eat, let us puree.
The guy you were expecting will be along in a minute. I'm just here to break the ice.
It's ok, it's nice to finally meet a man with a pulse
So, what’s spinning around in that head of yours?
It's just that in your photos you looked more like a Cuisinart.
Sometimes I wish I couldn't see everything that is going on in your head.
I thought you said "slender".
Are you going to answer my question or are you still processing?
To be honest, when I heard this was a mixer, I was expecting something else.
Well I don't like when you push my buttons either.
So,"Oster," is that a family name?
You've given me a lot to process.
Chop, blend, liquify, purée - how about “think?” Do you have a “think” button?
Take your time. I know it's a lot to process.
So...what turns you on?
I’ve never met someone transblender before.
Truthfully John, you’re not my first appliance.
I just think I should be seeing other appliances.
I'll give you a minute to process that.
I see you're still processing everything.
Must you over-process Everything?
Did it ever occur to you, Phil, that I might need an outlet too?
It's just a lot to process, you know?
Stop mincing your words, Harold.
How long have you lived in Hamilton Beach?
I like you, but we both know you'll just end up sitting on my kitchen counter gathering dust.
It’s over, Steven. I’ve fallen in love with the toaster.
I don't think you're processing what I'm saying.
Fred, you're mincing your words again.
Ordinarily I don't date guys I meet at mixers.
I just got out of a long-term warranty.
I thought "impressive equipment" was a little forward on your dating profile.
I ask for blend, I get chop. I ask for puree, I get shred. I'm sorry, Carl. It's over.
I feel like you're not processing what I'm saying.
Well you seem to be processing it well.
I'm leaving you for a Cuisinart.
I am having a hard time processing all this.
Are there any other unusual body parts I should know about?
So, I understand you work in the White House Communications Office?
Next time, we'll call ahead and ask to be seated next to an outlet.
You don't look at all like your pitcher.
Do small appliances run in your family?
At this point, I've dated everything but the kitchen sink"
Would you lower your setting. People are staring.
You're mincing your words.
I realize it will take you a while to process this.
Take your time. It’s a lot to process.
Do you have to process everything I say?
So how long have you been in the Trump administration?
That’s a Sunbeam. Your photo showed a Vitamix.”
Bob, mincing your words will only make this conversation harder.
This is just a lot for me to process right now.
Well, I did want a man with a pulse.
No, I don’t think my dress is the reason people are staring.
My profile does say I'd consider anyone with a pulse, but it was just a figure of speech.
I don’t think I have the counter space for this relationship.
My last date didn't have a pulse.
Sorry, but I wanted to meet a man who could blend in, not a man I could actually blend in.
Stop mincing words.
You looked more like a food processor in your picture.
Thats funny, my name is Brenda
You seem agitated
In your photo, it was a Cuisinart.
Honestly, you should come out as transblender in your profile
It's  kale, goddammit. Just chew it like a normal human person.
I'm afraid to ask, but where is your off button?
I'll give you some time to process this.
I see you’re still processing this.
Do you come with attachments?
On the other hand, it's nice to meet a man who doesn't chew with his mouth open.
Are there any other small appliances I need to know about?
Not your fault......I never should have checked the " Anything with a pulse" box.
At this point, I'll date any guy with a pulse setting
I know it's a lot to process ...
I want to warn you — things always get messy when I open up.
At least I still turn you on.
I've never seen you this agitated
Your bio didn't mention you're cordless.
I think I'll eat it whole, but thank you.
Too much to Process?
You don't mince words, do you?
I'm sorry Frank, but I need more than a 90-day limited warranty.
Your photo was of a newer model
When you mentioned you worked in food processing I had no idea you meant this.
I'm sorry but I can never love you the way I love the Roomba.
"Honestly, at this stage i'll date anyone with a pulse."
Finally I'm dating someone with a pulse.
Thank you for putting away your cell phone, I find it very distracting.
I thought you were kidding when you said your name was 'Hamilton Beach'".
I’ll date anyone with a pulse.
I can see you're still processing this.
I'm glad they had a table with an outlet.
This is my first mixer.
Honey, you're slurrying your words again.
I'm sick and tired of how you process things.
When you mentioned on the phone you're from Hamilton Beach, this isn't what I pictured.
Cuisinart. So you must be French.
I’m turned on very easily.
We all need an outlet.
You take me out and all you do is whine.
Carl, not here. I'll turn you on when we get home.
Sean really? That blender with that shirt ?
To be honest, your profile pic looked like a newer model...
I told Cynthia I'd take any date with a pulse.
So tell me, what is spinning around in that head of yours?
No, I've never met a transblender person before...
I’m sorry, but he just has more settings than you.
Sure.  It’s all fun and games until somebody’s warranty expires.
I wish I knew what was in that crazy, mixed-up head of yours.
I can't lie anymore -- I've been seeing the toaster.
I'm afraid you're not processing what I'm saying
I don't know why my mother says I'd date anyone with a pulse.
At this point I'll take anyone with a pulse.
Tell me again what happened to your last girlfriend?
I prefer a man who doesn't mince words.
A relief, actually. My last match was with a pothead.
You're making that noise again!
Stop mincing your words and tell me what's on your mind.
I can see you're still processing.
Obviously, you need time to process things.
I know that I've given you a lot to process tonight.
That's a lot to process on the first date.
Harold, PLEASE, Stop mincing my words!
Can’t you just unplug and enjoy a nice meal?
Could you please lower your voice to chop?
You can't leave me now - you came with a three year warranty!
I'm thinking you're not a good kisser.
At this point I’m willing to go out with anybody who has a pulse.
So you started out in infomercials...
I thought you meant I was going to see Hamilton the MUSICAL.
You spin every thing I say!
I traditionally only date major appliances.
Besides margaritas, what else do you like?
I'm trying to process this too.
Take all the time you need - I’m still processing my thoughts too ...
You have some lettuce stuck between your blades.
I’ve tried dating apps before, but you’re my first appliance.
No, I don't mind...the last person I dated was an attorney.
Is this what they meant when they said "Adult Mixer
I have to tell you that I’m leaving you for the microwave.
You're not processing what I'm saying.
I have to admit I'm disappointed. You looked like a Vitamix in your profile picture.
When Angela said you were a real smoothie, I imagined something a bit different.
Joe, I hate that I have to push your buttons to get a pulse out of you.
It only happens when someone pushes my buttons.
I’m leaving you, I need a man who doesn’t mince words.
Don't worry. No one looks like their profile photo.
You don’t need to be “on” all the time.
I'm leaving you for a toaster.
My first Grindr date too
Looks like that's the only Hamilton you're going to see tonight.
When I said anyone with a pulse...
Thanks for the offer, but I really don’t mind chewing.
Do you have to make so much noise when you chew?
I was a little teapot, short and stout, but then I transitioned.
Just once I'd like to know what's going on inside that head of yours.
I love you, but I hate the noises you make when you eat.
Let me get this straight: it turns you on when I push your buttons?
I really think chewing 32 times would be sufficient.
Could you perhaps chew on "low"?
Honestly, you're all Braun and no brains.
Why does it take you so long to process everything I say?
First time on Grindr?
I wish you would stop mincing your words.
Sometimes I feel like you don't even have a pulse.
I've got to stop dating just anything with a pulse.
I just feel like you’re giving me mixed messages.
I still think you would have been happier with the dental implants.
There's no easy way to say this but... I'm leaving you for the toaster.
I think I'll have that drink after all.
Do you even hear yourself?
Are you even processing what I'm saying to you?
There's no need to apologize. I'm all waffle iron from the waist down.
You know, Jim, sometimes you push my buttons, too.
Stop mincing your words—who is she?
You’re just not my speed.
So do you attend many mixers?
I need time to process.
Your profile said you were a major appliance
What do you mean, you’re turned on?
I’m having an affair with the washing machine.
I push YOUR buttons? Really?
This is not what I expected when I signed up for the mixer
Sorry, I'm still processing what you just said.
For God’s sake, Henry, just go ahead and get the dentures.
Wow! My ex only had two settings.
I do feel you've gotten better at processing your emotions.
You looked more like a KitchenAid in your profile pictures...
When I saw a flyer for a 'Single Mixer', I assumed it was an event of some sort.
So... You're from Hamilton Beach...
You want to push MY buttons?
I need time to process things, too, John.
Somehow you manage to twist everything I say!
The 'B' in BYOB stands for 'beverage,' Tom.
You think you’re a real smoothie, don’t you?!
Don't mince words with me, Bob...
I see your wife finally found out about us.
I said "Big spender!" not "Big blender!"
When your profile mentioned you were a food processor, I thought it was your employment information.
I'd invite you back to my place, but it's a cupboard.
You're going to need time to process this.
Unlike my last date, at least you have a pulse.
It's a good ice-breaker
I don't know why you let other people push your buttons
I wish you could just tell me how you feel without processing everything
It's Margaret, not Margarita.
Waring Blender darling, not Wearing blender!!!
The least you could do is turn it off when I am talking to you.
I love you I do ...but I need something more solid from our relationship.
After dinner, I'm taking you to Goodwill.
You promised me you would get off the juice.
I'm sorry,Glen. I've fallen in love with my Instant Pot.
Are you going to break the ice or shall I?
We prefer the term "Appliance American"
Your profile said you came from a blended family.  I guess I misunderstood.
Well, don't mince words.
And you say I don't turn you on any more?
Perhaps we should find a quieter setting.
Nice ice breaker.
Could you use a lower setting?  People are beginning to stare.
Blend? Grate? Liquefy? Chop?
 I feel as if I don't know who you are any more
I fully regret turning you on.
So fascinating. Do you write all the president's speeches?
Drinks are on me.
You look a little different from your pitcher...
Could you stop staring at the bartender?
No Roger, I won't turn you on.
It's just that I can't process these things as fast as you can.
I thought I was going to meet someone "at" a mixer.
Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite movies, too.
You photoshopped your profile picture.
Eric, do you always have to put your spin on everything?
In my defense, your profile pic was a KitchenAid.
I'm giving YOU mixed messages?
I told the agency I was hoping to meet a gentleman whose intentions were pure......not puréed.
Please say there's a margarita in there.
Hold on, let me process what you've just said!
And I thought my date with Mr. Coffee was bad.
When I said I’d date anyone with a pulse, I didn’t mean the setting.
Just try to blend in.
In your Tinder picture, you were a cappuccino maker.
Why must you alway Osterize me when we're out in public
Still not the worst first date I've had.
So... is this your first singles mixer?
If I wanted to go on a date with someone who vibrates, I would have stayed home.
I can see your food when you chew.
At least now I know you have a pulse, Henry.
What are the odds that I'd meet a mixer at a mixer?
I thought you had a pulse.
MUST you put a spin on everything I say!
So what exactly do you do at Shake Shack?
What exactly do you mean by 'Let's give it a whirl'?
It’s more of a pulsing headache.
Well, process this. I met someone.
I just don't think you are processing what I'm saying.
It's so great to meet a man with a pulse.
Perhaps if you weren't trying so hard to blend in?
I can see your blades turning, tell me what you're thinking.
Tim, I am leaving you for the juicer.
I didn't mean to push your buttons.
Do any of your other parts also vibrate?
I wish you wouldn't try so hard to blend in.
You don’t always have to break everything down for me.
Okay, you got into the molecular transporter, and decided you wanted a mai tai? So, then what happened?
You know people are just using you, right?
I think I want to see otber appliances
I am not ignoring you. I am just processing things before responding
Honey, I told you to close your lid when you chew.
You're profile said can whip, chop, mix. I just thought you liked to cook.
We can go see “Hamilton” or go to the beach. Whatever turns you on.
I feel like when I turn you on you don't hear a word that I say.
I know it's a lot, take your time to process it all
This is the last time I agree to a singles mixer.
... and of course, we'll have to have a safe word.
I’m sorry, but when you texted about a ‘blend date’ I assumed it was a typo.
I know this may be a lot to process.
So, your brother is Mr. Coffee?
So the Genie thought you said, 'Smoothie operator'?
Annie told me you were a real smoothie.
No, it’s fine—my first husband was in Radiohead.
Is that a yes or a no?
I'm worried that you've been overprocessing things lately.
It's so hard to know what's going on on your head, but I hope it's a margarita.
Why can’t you just chew your ice like everyone else?
My friends will never believe we met on Grinder!
I appreciate that you don't mince your words
What else did you forget to tell me?
I agree,it is an excellent ice breaker.
I've had it with your mixed messages.
I should let you know, I'm seeing other appliances.
Must you process every single thing I say?
That's just purée nonsense.
You seem to be having trouble processing that.
You certainly know how to break the ice.
I know I said I’d date anyone with a pulse, but ....
When you said you "like to mix it up", I assumed you meant in the bedroom.
So, what do you do to escape the daily grind?
Do you have to always make that noise when you eat?
I have to admit, I thought 'five-minute mixers" referred to something else.
First time at a mixer ?
Sometimes,I just don't know what goes on in that head of yours.
Can we enjoy one meal without you getting turned on?
Before you I've never met anyone from Margaritaville.
When you've finished your pesto , would you mind topping off my Margarita?
No, it's ok. Honestly, at my age I just need a man with a pulse.
Where is your biggest turn-off?
Am I turning you on?"
If you wanted the soup, you should have just ordered it.
When your profile mentioned coming from a blended family, I was picturing something different.
That's a coincidence - my name's Brenda..
I wish you'd stop mincing words.
I am tired of you putting a spin on everything I say
I'm getting mixed messages here.
Would you mind if I chew?
I'm a little annoyed by your constant whining.
What pronoun do you prefer?
Ever think about turning me on?
I didn't know who I would meet on Blendr.
I shouldn't have asked for a date with a pulse.
Honey, everyone is staring at us. I told you that dress was too revealing.
I've had it with always needing to sit near an outlet.
There wasn't a table by the window with an outlet.
Must you get juiced every night?
You’re an upgrade.  Most my blind dates don’t even have a pulse.
Are you processing this?
First mixer?
''My ex pushed all my buttons at once."
I thought my friend was setting me up with her Cousin Art.
Well, I guess you DO mince your words after all.
I regret the transplant but I love the smoothies.
You still have a bit of spinach stuck top left.
No thanks, I'll just chew mine.
So your profile said you make great cocktails?
I assumed your profile pic was just a metaphor...
You probably should have used Grinder instead of Tinder.
Lately you go from chop to liquify without any warning. I didn’t think that I was pressing your buttons.
Yes, but I want more than just free margaritas, Jerry.
Don't be so hard on yourself. At least you have a pulse.
Sure, I like a man who likes to work in the kitchen, but I also like a man with a good head on his shoulders.
I never know the right button's to push on you...
I thought "blend date" was a typographical error.
Look,  just whir once for ‘yes’ and twice for ‘no’.
Sorry, I can be a real motor mouth.  Tell me about you.
When she said it was a mixer, I thought she meant the event.
It's cuisine, Art.
Stop mincing your words!
So are we splitting the bill or shredding it?
I wish you wouldn’t mince words.
Yeah, my job's also a grind sometimes, but I don't let it get into my head.
It seems like you're having trouble processing this.
I can't stand the sounds you make when you eat.
I'm leaving you for a wine opener.
Oh no, did I push a button?
Why can’t you just chew your food like other people?
So you're from Margaritaville?
Too much ice gives me a headache, too.
Your sending me mixed messages.
Well, I assume everyone would know how to push your buttons.
Well I'm sorry. I didn't even know Trans-Blender was a thing...
Well, at least you told the truth about being a good mixer.
I almost didn't recognize you without your glasses.
No Dale, things can't to go back to the way they whir.
Is this your first mixer?
Um, what are your hands doing right now?"
Must you always mince your words?
Wouldn't it be easier to chew each mouthful 32 times?
I thought you said you were just coming off a bender.
Most guys won't help in the kitchen.
First dates are usually so awkward, at least you know how to break the ice.
What's so hard to process?
Did I turn you on?
I hope you're not just another smoothie.
Do I still turn you on?
When your profile mentioned you were comfortable in the kitchen, I had no idea...
You're much more interesting than my last date.  He didn't have a pulse mode.
I'm really not trying to push your buttons!
I actually prefer chewing my own food, but thanks for offering.
So what does a mixologist actually do?
My husband is starting to wonder why his son is a toaster.
Your first mixer?
I can see you have mixed feelings about me...
Have they said what’s taking so long with your dentures?
Do you identify as a trans-blender?
I know this is hard to process
Would you even have married me if my name wasn't Margarita?
Why can't you just chew your food like everyone else?
For once I'd just like to blend in.
So you work with ICE?
Why can't you just use a knife?
I thought the dating service said you were a lender.
With apologies to Shakespeare, 'Neither a borrower nor blender be'...
Well aren’t you a smoothie.
I see they pushed your buttons at work again, dear.
I hope you know you're causing quite a stir!
I mean really George, it's embarrassing!  Can't you just chew your damn food like the rest of us?
You had more time for me when you were a slow cooker.
It’s not you, it’s me and it's nothing to do with your small appliance.
When the invitation said "mixer", I didn't take it literally.
Thanks for doing this. A lot of women freak out when they learn I have no pulse.
I see you're upset. Just keep your lid on.
So what pushes your buttons?
I SAID I’M FROM MINNEAPOLIS. MY PARENTS STILL LIVE THERE.
Isn't it great to get out of the kitchen for a change?
Please don't mince words.
I met my first husband at a mixer.
We can kiss but no tongue, okay?
Look, it's not going to work out with us.  I'm the Hamptons and you're Hamilton Beach.
Wait till you see my hands.
Oh John, lets not mince words!
Well, how does anyone end up in small appliances?
Cuisinart? Is that French?
Could you process your thoughts a little less visibly?
Yes, a daiquiri would be fine.
You can spin all you want, Roger, but I'm still raising them Jewish.
I can't do this anymore. You keep sending me mixed signals.
What do you think of my new dress? And don't mince your words.
Why do you always have to put a different spin on what I have to say?
I said, let us pray. Not puree.
It’s my first time on Grindr.
I hear what you're saying, but it's not processing.
Could you please switch to a lower setting? People are staring.
I can dress you up, I can take you out, but you'll never blend in.
I feel like you're always giving me mixed signals.
Well, well, aren't you the smoothie...
So, how was your spin class?
Just so you know, I won't go to 10 on the first date.
As my profile said, I process things quickly.
Honey, I still think false teeth would have been a better option"
You're a real smooth operator, aren't you?
You were more fun without the lid.
And the telemarketer told you that Medicare is going to pay for it?
True, you don't blend in. But you make a great margarita.
I'm cheating on you... yes, it's the washing machine.
I guess I was wrong, you do have a pulse.
Sorry, I'm a little nervous. This is my first speed date.
I guess the craziest place I've ever done it was on the kitchen counter.
Can we talk about something else? I didn't mean to push your buttons.
In your Tinder pic, you looked more like a toaster.
I hate myself for always pushing your buttons.
That's exactly the problem, Frank, you escalate to puree before I even get stirred.
You don't have to mince your words with me.
For once, can't we just have a quiet conversation?
Must you mix your metaphors?
Can’t you just chew like a normal person?
You're actually the first person I've dated that looked exactly like your profile picture.
Why don’t you just get dentures?
That's quite an icebreaker.
It was a simple comment. I wasn't making fun of your small appliance.
Actually, "stop" is a speed.
I thought I was done with mixers after college
I'm just processing what you're saying, Edith.
Is this your first time at 12-speed dating?
I see you have mixed emotions
Was there anything else you replaced with an appliance?
Would it kill ya to just pulse for a while?
In your picture you looked like the newer model.
Does it hurt if I turn you on?
When you called yourself a mixologist, I had no idea.
For once, Charlie, could you simply chew your food?
Wearing blender, I hate visual puns.
Speak up! You know I can't hear you when you're on Puree
Do you mind eating on "pulse"?Everyone is looking at us.
You're mixing up everything I say!
Must you chew everything 32,000 times?
So, what do you do at the White House?
Honey, please set yourself to 'low'... People are beginning to stare.
You always said I make your head spin.
You’re not very social for a mixer.
It's not true, John. Margaritas are not the only reason I'm attracted to you.
Well, you certainly know how to break the ice.
You're right. I think we did meet at a college mixer.
Honey, you're at a 10 right now and I need you at a 1.
I’d like to bring you to my friend’s bridal shower.
I don’t think that buzzing in your head is tinnitus
You can't just start to emulsify whenever the conversation gets hard.
Besides puree, chop, and whip, what do you do?
Actually, dear, the Keurig looks much better on you.
Was it hard growing up in a blended family?
When did your doctor say you could start eating solid food again?
Still processing?
I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.
So,you’re a transblender .
I assure you, madam, my intentions are puree.
So other than the photo, was the rest of your dating profile accurate?
Please stop sending me mixed messages.
I must have misunderstood when they invited me to a mixer.
When I said 'let's give it a whirl' I meant let's go on a second date.
So on your dating profile you said you’re from a blended family.
Head turner?  Yeh, I get that a lot.
For once, couldn’t you just chew your food like a normal person?
Ironically, it's that you don't blend in.
Don't be ridiculous, you'll blend right in.
So, how do you feel about mixed marriage?
I should have listened when she told me you were a smoothie.
So your profile says you are a good processor.
Put a lid on it Jerry"
"Forget everything you've heard about small appliances."
Well, I could go for a nice strawberry daiquiri--if it's not too much of a problem.
I assure you, my intentions are purée.
I just feel that everything is mixed up in that little head of yours.
The last guy I dated didn't even have a pulse button.
They told me you were a smoothie.
We never really talk any more.
But enough about me...
Are you even listening to me? You know, I honestly wonder sometimes where your head even is.
I thought they said you were a smooth operator, not a smoothie operator.
I have mixed feelings about us too.
I thought your profile said pushing your buttons was a turn on.
I guess I should warn you. I just took six hits of mescaline.
I think we should see other appliances.
I'm sure it is healthy, but that was the centerpiece.
Whirrr, whirrr, whirrr" is not a commitment, Leonard
At least you still have a pulse.
Is it a common dental procedure in Britain?
I thought 'blend date' was a typo.
And you say that you have had no digestion problems since the transplant?
I'm still processing what you just said.
Could you chew on low?
Is everything O.K.? You’ve hardly pulverized your dinner.
It's my fault, I thought you said trans gender.
You seem agitated. Was it something I said?
This is my first single's mixer.
I love what you’re Waring!
Sometimes I just want to know what’s spinning around in that puréed little head of yours.
I like you, too... I'm just not sure I'm ready to emulsify.
I think you could have been more forthcoming in your dating profile than 'serious foodie.'
Let me get this straight: You gave her a blender for Valentine’s Day?
There's no good way to tell you this, but I've decided I'd like a food processor.
Of course they liked you at the party.  You’ve always been a good mixer.
When you told me you were from  a blended family..
Years later, this would be Susan's only memory of their honeymoon in Margaritaville.
It's just when you get going I just can't hear myself think!
No offense Larry, but you are seriously mixed up.
On our speed date you were smooth and I was stirred but what was once a crush is now a grind and frankly...it’s Waring thin.”
So when you wrote in your profile that you were from a 'blender family'  it wasn't a typo.
I just don't see a future for us. Why is this so hard to process?
Let’s not mince words
You've been listening to Trump again, haven't you.
You're lying, John. You purée when you lie.
I'm guessing you were the life of the party back at Dartmouth.
I just need some counter space right now.
I can't talk to you when you're on purée.
I can definitely go slower if you like.
Please don't pulse while I tell you about my day.
And you think I’m mixed up?
Yeah, my job's also a grind sometimes, but I don't let it go to my head.
So, is there a setting on there for “stimulating conversation” or... ?
I misunderstood when you said you wear out kitchen appliances.
Ron, that's disgusting! I wish you would chew with your lid on.
I'm so turned on right now.
I'm sorry , Eddie, this isn't going to work. I'm in love with a toaster.
Blend. James Blend.
Puree, that's an interesting name. Is it French?
I don’t care if it has six speeds - it’s still a one-track mind.
Let me get you up to speed . . .
"You keep sending me mixed messages."
So your mother’s name was Margarita?
Must you put your spin on EVERYTHING I say?!!
Tell me more about your time in the Trump cabinet
So, mixologist. Is that like a degree or a condition?
All I said was, “Alexa, get me one of those smart blenders.”
You don't want to get mixed up with a guy like me, Dottie.
There you go again, Ostercising everything I say
Wouldn't it be simpler just to chew your food?
Pulse once for yes, pulse twice for no and pulverize for angry.
. . . No Harold, it's your obsession with homogeneity that I find most troubling.
Try a different setting. You keep chopping off your words.
I was picturing more of a whirlwind romance.
Sorry, I thought you said your mother's name was Brenda.
That's better.  For a while, I didn't think you had a pulse.
Disappointed?  A bit. Your profile said you were a Hamilton Beach.
Honey, I'm seeing another kitchen appliance.
You need to unplug.
How are are you related to Edward Scissorhands exactly?
This pot is SO much stronger than when I was in college!
I've never know anyone who chews their food 3,200 times before swallowing.
And this particular superpower is useful how?
I think I've changed my mind about a first kiss
You might try simply chewing.
Actually, you blend right in
Don't be silly. You blend right in.
While you're processing that, I'll take the opportunity to visit the ladies'.
No, Richard. You’re the one sending mixed messages.
Give me a minute to process that thought.
Unlike you, I've never been much of a mixer.
Please don't chew with your lid unlocked.
It feels like our lives are moving at different speeds.
Ironically, Lucy found it hard to process
Wow, you're a real smoothie.
No judgement. It's just that in your profile photo, you had a head.
What serious thoughts are whirling around that powerful little brain of yours?
Dear, I believe your liquid diet has finally gone to your head!
It's just that I'd had something quite different in mind when you said you came from a blended family...
Pulse or no pulse, it’s time to pull the cord.
Oh please, let's not mince words again tonight.
You had me at margarita.
I know the feeling, I work in the Trump administration.
I'll admit, when you profile said "mixed" I thought it meant biracial.
I'm sorry; I just don't need another small appliance in my life.
Really, Gerald! Must you set yourself to ‘frappe’ while I’m speaking?
I thought you were kidding when you said you come from a blended family.
But Charlie, I'm looking for pure love, not puree love.
I think I misunderstood what they meant by social mixer.
I get that you need to process.
I suppose cutlery is out of the question?
Are you going to shake your head at me all night?
To think we first met at a high school mixer.
Give me a minute to process what you said.
In your Tinder photo you looked more like a coffee pot.
I swear it's like your head is somewhere else...
I don't care Fred, you still need to use a knife and fork when we are out.
To be honest, if I wanted another small appliance I would just look in my bedside table.
We'll always have Margaritaville.
For a first date this is going pretty smoothly.
I’m afraid there’s some mix up here.
I misunderstood your online profile when it said you come from a blended family.
``I still think dentures would've been better.''
Let me bring you up to speed...
you're still processing that e-mail from my mother, aren't you?
Why must you find everything I say so hard to swallow?
Sorry, I just can't get past your other attachments.
Was it difficult growing up in a blended family?
I thought your bio said 'blended family', not 'blender family'.
I don’t think that’s what they meant by BYOB!
I must say, I had a whole different picture in mind when I accepted the invite to a mixer.
I didn't recognize you at first. In your profile picture you looked more like a coffee maker.
But you never want to mix things up in the bedroom...
Don’t worry. You’ll blend right in.
You are a really smoothie, aren’t you?
This isn't exactly what I thought you meant when you told me you blend in anywhere
I'm open to blended family, but keep a lid on it for now.
It's not you, Jim. It's my kitchen decor.
Can't wait for you to meet my brother Edward. Just don't shake his hand.
I didn’t catch that...you’re slurring.
Don't mince words with me.
I think I'm in love. You said your mind was literally in a whirl...that's the first correct use of 'literally' I've ever heard.
I just wish you could unplug sometimes.
I liked you better when you were a toaster.
I've been having mixed feelings too.
No, I think you're the one who's mixed up.
Honey, you’re grating - please try to blend.
They said you were smooth. I just thought...
Ah now I get what “High speed blender dating” is.
My last boyfriend was a toaster, so this is totally normal.
Oh, none for me, Linda. Daiquiris go straight to my head
I'm seeing someone with less attachment issues.
I don't know what spinning around in that head of yours but I don't see great consistency.
I’m afraid I misunderstood  your Tinder  job profile thinking that  “Food Processor “ meant you are a chef.
I feel like you’re giving me mixed signals.
That's not what I meant when I said "Let's give this thing a whirl."
So what do you do when you're not making Margaritas?
Honey, I think your margarita is done.
What I wouldn't give to know what goes on in that mixed-up head of yours.
I suppose in your profession you must be ‘on’ all the time?
You seem a little mixed up.
I still think that a good pair of false teeth would work just as well.
Please tell me how you feel, and don't mince your words!
Honey, you can't just switch to "agitate"  every time I mention the White House.
You don’t look like your photo on Tinder either.
I feel as if you’re giving me mixed messages.
I'm not sure my kids would be comfortable living in a blended family.
You're sending mix signals
I'm leaving you for a man with a better warranty, Carl.
Here, let me get you up to speed.
Must you always hum when you eat
For this one night, can't I get you to unplug?
Is it that hard to just turn that thing off when I’m talking to you?
Am I going on too long? I swear sometimes I have no off switch.
I AM trying to blend in, Janice!
We’re in public, keep a lid on it!
At this point in my life I'm just looking for a man with a PULSE.
Well, at least you've got a pulse.
What are your gender pronouns?
In your Tinder photo you looked like a Vitamix.
When my friends recommended a mixer, this wasn't quite what I was expecting...
For once would you stop mincing words and tell me how you feel?
So that's why you asked the waiter for an extension cord.
Honey, you forgot your tie.
This was not exactly what I had in mind when I said you needed to blend in.
Really, George, I can just ask the waiter for a smoothie.
YOU ALWAYS PUT A DIFFERENT SPIN  ON EVERYTHING I SAY.
I imagined something different when you said you were from a blended family.
The invitation said a date AT a mixer.
Please don't mince your words with me!
I'm bisexual so I'm on both Grindr and Pulse.
My...aren't you quite the smoothie?
Ok, you got me.  What's green and goes 170 miles an hour?
When you said you were a mixer, I thought you were just a really social, uh, human.
What the hell did you put in those brownies, Travis?
It's impossible to talk to you. You're always on.
You know, in my twenties I don't think I'd even have considered dating a blender.
Still trying to process Mr. Mueller's report, dear?
Have you always been this mixed up?
You're not the only one with mixed emotions, you know.
I know which buttons to push to turn you on.
I'm sorry. I've fallen in love with the Instant Pot.
I take it you're still on a liquid diet?
I'm sorry I said  my daily grind is worse than yours.
How long have you had the tinnitus?
Honestly, Jill left out a few key details when telling me she was setting me up with Hamilton Beach.
It's not you. It's me who's all mixed up.
My friends warned me you were a smoothie operator.
This really isn't the type of attachment I was looking for.
When you said you had mixed emotions, I really had no idea.
I thought Mr. Smoothie was just a name you used on match.com.
I get it - breaking up's hard. It takes time to process.
I'll date almost anything with a pulse button.
When your post said you were a real smoothie.....
Do you have any other small kitchen appliances I should know about?
I've never dated a mover and shaker before.
Well, aren't you the smoothie!
You need to take that down to about frappe' mister.
So how long have you worked in Washington?
Every time I bring up marriage, you switch to "Puree."
Arnold, you're mixing up everything I say.
Does every meal have to be a production?
I don’t want you blowing your top at another fancy restaurant.
I hate going to these mixers. How about you?
Well, I have mixed feelings about you, too!
My ex had a 5 speed motor and a stay-put lid.
They said the first date was a mixer, but I didn’t expect this.
Really, it's not you. It's that unbearable noise.
I've been looking for someone with a pulse.
Maybe I don’t need to say this, but I don’t kiss on the first date.
Tell me more about your job as a floor model.
You're spinning everything I say.
I really like you Roger, but I feel like you're sending mixed messages.
I thought when I connected with you I was on Tinder, not Grindr.
I think I know what's been triggering your migraines.
I’ve moved on, but I do miss the daiquiris.
I sense you may be finding our breakup talk hard to process.
‘´Do I turn you on?’
So you grew up in a blended family?
It started with a root canal...
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving you for a Veg-O-Matic.
I've asked you before not to purée in public.
So, when exactly did you realize you were Transblender?
It's ok as long as you don't eat with your lid open.
Will you please keep a lid on it?
There you go, twisting my words again.
I thought Ingrid said you were Mr. Smooth, not Mr. Smoothie.
Can’t we just spend one evening unplugged?
We should take our relationship to the next level; chop/dice.
Blendr is the first dating app I've used.
Don't worry darling, nobody has noticed at all.  In fact, you're blending in very well.
Just HOW did we meet again?  Was it Tumblr, Grindr or Blendr?
Why didn't you just get implants?
There seems to be some kind of mix up.
You know, your bio on the dating site WAS misleading. I thought you just meant you mixed well with people.
I don't really know what I expected from a dating app called 'Blendr'
Please just this once try the knife and fork, people are staring!
I have to say, you don't look much like your profile picture.
Fred, what are you Waring?
Wait slow down, give me a second. I need to process all of this.
You know you could just try taking smaller forkfuls.
Honey, it doesn’t matter what we wear. The reality is, we will never blend in.
Yes it's very flattering, but are you sure it's me that's made your head spin?
What are your thoughts on blended families?
I've dated an egghead and a meathead but this is a first.
You really are a smoothy.
You never hear a word I say.
I can see what you are thinking and it's not pretty.
My mother warned me of getting into another mixed up relationship.
Oh, you vibrate.  Well, that’s a plus.
I was afraid you'd be a toaster
In my profile I did mention I like a guy who helps in the kitchen.
Oh, Hamilton, I can't marry you.  I don't want a blended family.
«I have a much harder time processing my emotions».
I was worried you wouldn't look like your profile picture.
When you told me you were a mover and a shaker, I didn’t realize you were an actual mixer.
Looks like you’ve spoken to your mother today.
It's more intimate when you're on low.
I think we need to put our relationship on pulse.
Actually, I prefer men either shaken or stirred.
sorry we couldn't get the booth, i need a 220 volt outlet
You could just ask the waiter for a knife and fork.
You're so much better than the last guy I dated - always eating with his lid open.
It's not that 1200 watts of puree power isn't impressive...you just seemed taller in your photo.
No, you don't have anything on your face.
Stop pushing my buttons!
I need to know where I stand, and please, don’t mince words.
I think it's cute the way you mix your metaphors.
I'm not sure you're in any position to lecture me about using an old profile picture
You know I can't understand you when you pulse.
So it’s osterperosis?
So... how was therapy?
For the last time, yes, I thought ‘turn-ons include my power switch’ was a joke.
I'm just afraid that if we go too fast things will get messy.
Honestly. Sometimes I think you don't have a pulse.
We'll always have the daiquiris, John.
Did I push a wrong button again?
I find you extremely sexy when you are on Pulse mode.
This isn’t what I meant when I asked you to blend in more.
Every time I start a sentence with “I think,” you hit the pulse button.
I just think we're running at different speeds.
So what’s it like coming from a blended family?
Fred Waring. That'll be easy to remember.
Perhaps we should have tried a different setting.
My mother is a Vitamix and my father is a Hamilton Beach, so I come from a blended family.
Can’t you just chew your food like the rest of us?
Yes, I like pina coladas,
I'm sorry. This isn't my speed.
Well I don't think you're a tool.
I can’t help thinking that you are having mixed feelings about this relationship.
Sue said she met you at a mixer... she could've mentioned...
Relax. You blend in.
I sense you have mixed feelings for me?
I feel like you never really hear me.
How much longer on that milkshake?
Is this your idea of blending in?
I pour my heart out to you and all you can hear is your own spin on it.
How do I know that your intentions are purée?
I hate it when you give me mixed messages.
When you said you were a part of a blender family, I assumed it was  a typo.
Is it really necessary to chew each bite 5,400 times?
Don’t you dare mince words with me!
So how long have you been on a liquid diet?
So you're saying that with just four easy payments, a long-term relationship can be mine?
You take everything I say and mix it up!
Why can't you chew your food like everybody else?
Be honest, don't mince words with me!
Yes, I'm aware your profile described you as a shaker and a mover...
You don't have to process. Just agree
It's a simple yes or no question.
I knew this would make your head spin.
Hey Oster Boy.  Eyes are up HERE
I warned you not to let that liquid diet go to your head.
When your profile said you like to mix things up, I had something else in mind.
Oh stop it. You’re mixing apples and oranges again.
I think this would be a more fruitful conversation if you took yourself off “puree”.
You haven't touched anything but your banana and a little yogurt.
I'm getting mixed signals here...
You're lucky, I have to chew.
I’m finding this hard to process.
Why can't you just chew like everyone else.
Could you at least try to blend in?
And here I thought Blender was just another dating app.
I didn't intend to push your buttons.
Could you please unplug for a second?
Couldn't you just cut your food with a fork and knife?
I hope you don't expect a kiss.
Diane said you were a smoothie.
I don't know why I went on this date. Brenda said you were a tool.
Are you dishwasher safe?
You keep mixing metaphors
I have to admit, when I read “ninja” on your profile I was really picturing something else.
Sorry...it takes me a while to process some things.
Please, Dudley, when we mix with the other guests, try to blend in.
You're the only one who doesn't push my buttons.
Frankly, I'm shaken--not stirred.
Can you just set it to low until we get home.
I thought you said you don’t mince words.
Stop playing with your food.
Don’t mince words, Charlie, tell me how you really feel.
You always are giving me mixed messages!
Maybe you're trying too hard to blend in.
But everything ELSE is completely normal, right?
It doesn't take much to turn you on.
You've giving me mixed signals all night
Geez, you look like I feel.
I thought you said you had been on a bender.
Just keep quiet and try to blend in.
Don't talk with your mouth full, dear.
It's just that you looked taller in your profile picture
You made more sense on liquefy.
Oh. I'm SO sorry. I'm looking for more of a mixer than a blender.
I'm sensing you have mixed feelings about this.
As a college D.J., I went by 'MixMaster.'
All I said was maybe we should go visit my mother.
God, I should never have signed up on Grindr.
When you told me you were transitioning I never expected this.
Slow down Harold. I hate it when you try to mix business with pleasure.
So I said to my friend Emily, yes I’d love to go to a mixer.
My first husband was a terrible mixer.
Wouldn't it be easier just to chew your food?
Dear, if you'd just get your damn teeth fixed, you wouldn't have to turn every dinner into a smoothie...
I thought you knew when you said "What, are you Waring?"
I mean, it literally makes my head spin. Literally.
The toaster oven didn't behave like this when I took him out.
I thought blend date was just a typo...
I said I am in favor of world peace, not whirled peas
No, I don't like pina coladas or getting caught in the rain.
Can't you see I'm trying to process?
Blender/Tinder...Darn you, auto-correct!
Don’t try to understand, darling, I can see I’m making your head spin.
Your profile said you were a Vitamix.
I didn’t say purée; I said let us pray.
You look nothing like your profile picture.
You're quiet tonight.
We should have sat at the countertop.
So, are you free tomorrow for drinks?
Yes, EVERYONE hears the buzzing in your head.
When you said online that you blend well with others, this is not quite what I expected.
Can you take it down to a pulse Jeremy, people are staring
You seem increasingly mixed up.
Pretty sure it was a juicer in your profile pic.
Don't twist my words, George.
This isn't what I expected when I signed up for the singles mixer.
That's really loud. Can you set it back to "mumble"?
Just this once - for me - could you just chew the meal?
You can’t smoothie-talk yourself out of this one, mister.
This isn't going to work. I can't take any more of your mixed messages."
Do you like piña coladas?
Dammit John, you know Margaritas go straight to your head.
Does that work in bed too?
Of course your pulse is irregular. It’s your best feature.
So, you're in politics?
Shall I assume your day was worse than mine?
Dear, please try to eat with your lid closed.
The ad must’ve read, ‘Single Mixers’.
You ARE a smoothie.
You always twist around everything I say
I suppose this is another one of your metaphors.
I need a man who isn’t restricted to three settings.
Your thoughts are such an interesting blend of  ideas and vegetables.
From your pictures, I thought you were a newer model.
So, what's your spin on things?
You're from a blended family?
Stop grinding your teeth
'Would you blend with your lid closed please?'
Is that a no?
It's not you, it's me. I'm just all mixed up.
So you say you come from a blended family?
Just so you know, I don't kiss on the first date.
You don't purée like this when we are at home.
Bob, I'm pregnant.
You know you tend to slur your words.
You know there's a guy in the kitchen who'll do that for you.
Dear, the better choice would have been dentures.
I must have spelled ‘Grindr’ wrong.
If you're trying to blend in, 
it's not working.
So you Juice?
Everyone lies a little bit on their dating page
At least that horrible comb over is a thing of the past.
I’ve tried a few dating apps, but you were my first match on Blendr.
You know margaritas make your head spin, dear.
Would you like me to cut up your food?
I'm surprised--you don't mince words.
You're trying way too hard to blend in.
Still on a liquid diet, I take it?
I'll admit, I had mixed feelings about this second date.
Couldn't you have dressed up with the Vitamix instead of that old Oster for our anniversary dinner, Dear.
‘I’ll be honest. Processed food is not my thing.’
When your profile said you had mush for brains I thought you were just being cute.
Just how long do you plan to stick to this liquid diet?
No, you look better with your hat on.
Is this your first time speed dating?
Your profile mentioned your last relationship didn't go smoothly...
I told the waiter you didn't need a knife
Oh! I think you have something in your teeth.
Have you checked your pulse lately?
Stop going around and around. Just out with it!
Next time tip the bartender”
I believe this juicing diet has gone to your head.
And I understand you met the donor's family at Williams Sonoma?
The current administration makes my head spin too.
My girlfriends were right...you are a smoothie.
To be honest, I’m not used to this kind of speed dating.
I think our relationship is ready for the next level.  Is that puree?
Do you think the kids would be open to a blended family?
Now I get how that man mistook his wife for a hat.
I'll be honest. It's because of the way you kiss.
I know. I know. Your goal this year is to get a head.
Perhaps I'm expecting too much from a smart appliance.
Your Blendr profile said you could crush ice, but I thought you just played hockey.
Don't talk with your container full!
I understand.  I grew up in a blended family, too.
You looked like a sippy cup in your profile picture.
And that's when Karen decided to deactivate all her dating apps, including BLNDR.
I just can't do this any more. The way you operate, I can never tell exactly what's inside your head.
Should I assume you're having mixed feelings?
I still think the Instant Pot would have been a trendier choice.
Could you dial it down a notch?
So you’re having mixed feelings?
Don’t be embarrassed. I come from a blended family too.
I fail to see how "variable speeds" can be your answer for literally every problem.
You looked more like a food processor in you profile picture.
I feel like I'm getting mixed signals.
I understand, I’m from a blended family too.
I just got out of a useless warranty, but I don't want to be single forever.
Mine, too. But figuratively.
I have to be honest. You don't look anything like your profile picture.
Slow down. I can't understand a word you're saying.
I thought I would be attending a mixer, not attending with one.
Okay, you clearly need some time to process that don’t you darling?
Oh Dear,  I can always tell something's wrong when you puree.
Having mixed feelings?
Oh, don't worry about the party. You'll blend right in.
Okay, now  you're giving me mixed messages.
I miss the quiet of your Darth Vader period.
Oh Gilbert, when you kiss me I just turn to mush.
Did I say something to agitate you.
Today was a blur.
Turn it off, Fred, that’s not what liquidate means.
It's difficult to talk to you when you puree.
And yet this is still the best Tinder date I've had this year.
Sorry, but my soulmate will have more than twelve speeds and six designer colors.
Give me a second. I'm still processing that thought.
I don't know if we'll hit it off, but I'm willing to give it a whirl.
I'm no doctor but I'm pretty sure that ringing in your ears isn't tinnitus.
I think this whole liquid diet thing has gone to your head !
Well, you’re quite the smoothie, aren’t you?
So, you think you're some kind of smoothie, eh?
Maybe we should have sat at the bar.
You could've just sent it back to the kitchen.
I feel like this should have been mentioned on your Tinder profile
Honey, you’re all mixed up.
When you said you were from a blended family, I pictured something else.
I suppose it does all go to the same place...
I'm sorry, darling, I didn't mean to push your buttons.
It's so refreshing to finally meet someone who actually looks like their dating profile picture!
Sorry if I seem distracted.  My head's going a mile a minute.
When your profile said you were a good blender, I thought that meant we would get along!
So, your profile says you blend well with others.
Is this your first Meet and Mix?
What I have planned for you after dinner will make _your_ head spin!
Are you always this turned on?
For heaven's sake, Brian, it's our anniversary. Could you please stop pulverizing for five minutes and have a conversation with me?
I think the meal would be more enjoyable at a slower speed.
I know your profile said you like to mix it up. I didn't know you meant literally
So Linda told me you work in a kitchen...
I'm not going out with you anymore if you insist on mincing my words.
Well, for starters, you’re nothing like your picture.
I just don't see the difference between pulse and chop
You never hear anything but your own spin.
Dentures would have been so much simpler.
So, what's shakin'?
I really wish you opted for the feeding tube.
This isn't the type of mixer I was expecting.
Brenda warned me that you were a real smoothie, but...
I SAID, OBVIOUSLY I’M STILL PROCESSING!
My friends warned me you were a smooth talker!
I just can't talk to you when you're set on puree.
Blender?  I thought I was on Tinder.
I only have two speeds: infatuation and undying love.
Do you have to carry the weight of the whirled on your shoulders?
‘Right...and I suppose you come with lifetime warranty as well?’
I love the way you blend right in whenever we go out.
So, how long have you been doing speed dating?
I'm so tired of your circular reasoning.
Based on your online dating profile, I was expecting a gourmet food processor.
I could have sworn that you were a newer model in your profile picture.
I'll give you this: you're a smooth talker.
It's just not the setting I was expecting.
Harold, I think you're taking this 'liquid diet' thing too far.
I'm looking for someone whose head is screwed on tight—but not too tight.
How do I know you're not just some smoothie?
You're moving way too fast, Mister."
I said "dress to blend in - you're so literal."
Can't you set it to "nibble"?
We're having a nice meal for once, Arthur. Try not to cram it in.
I just wish we could have a nice, quiet meal together.
When I was invited to a 'mixer'. This is not what I expected.
Sometimes I wonder if you have a pulse.
When your profile said you liked "mixing things up," I guess I didn't quite understand...
I worry that you are waring yourself out.
I know the flyer said a "blind date mixer" but this is not what I had in mind.
You know, I'm finding your attitude a little Waring
But if your juice cleanse is ending, what happens to... us?
Darling, look at you!  Do you have to over process everything I say? You're losing face value.
I’ve actually never been on a blend date before.
When you said your head was spinning....well, I just didn’t get it....
One drink and my head's spinning
Worry all you want. What I asked is that you stop whirring.
It's my first time at a mixer.
Everyone's looking. You'd promised we'd blend in...
You're sending mixed messages.
Why does every conversation have to turn into a process session with you?
I  sense you’re having mixed emotions Ted.
I met someone else at a mixer.
Hmmm, she did say that you were a real smoothie...
It goes in cycles. One day it’s all grate and grind and the next you’re praying for a pulse.
Liquidation may be your only option now.
What do you mean you have mixed feelings?
Yes,​ you are different however, this is New York City you will blend right​ in!"
You weren’t exaggerating when you said that buying a Vitamix really changed your life.
Unlike you, I only have one speed.
I liked you better on frappe.
Well, at least I know you have a pulse.
So how was it growing up in a blended family?
I need someone who has more than just a pulse.
So you're a mover and a shaker?
You say "I'M mixed up in the head"?
It's no more annoying than regular man sounds.
Can’t you at least unplug while we’re out on a date?
My ex constantly pushed my buttons.
I’m sorry Oster, but I’m leaving you for a Vitamix.
My ex was a hand beater.
I'm just having trouble processing all these emotions.
Honey, you know I can't understand you when you puree
Oh Bob, the margarita accident is in the past, you need to let it go.
When you said I made your head spin, I thought you meant something else.
I liked you better as a cockroach.
Interesting. I'm from a blended family, too.
I think you should have gone with the feeding tube, dear.
Is that a Waring you're wearing?
I presume you don't have a problem with a blended family.
Why is it that you always twist my words?
I'm sorry, but I think it's time to hit the 'pause button' in our relationship.
This is the last time I date off of QVC
I’m not breaking up with you, Mitch. I just want to put us on Pulse for a while.
Well if you ask me, that new shrink is really messing with your head.
I just thought your NAME was Hamilton. I didn't realize you WERE one.
How was Margaritaville?
I said yes to dinner with a mind bender; not a mindless blender.
It's only until my dentures are ready.
It's changed my life. I haven't seen a gastroenterologist in years!
You promised me you weren't going to puree in public.
Could you just take it off puree and listen to me for a change?
Oh, I misunderstood, I thought it said you were a smooth operator.
I’m sorry, but I don’t think a blended family will work.
You couldn’t tell by looking at me but I really am not comfortable at mixers.
Holly didn't mind, but she would've appreciated knowing Barry was transblender before the date.
So you're from a blended family, then?
Let's face it. You'll never blend in.
I'm just afraid our kids will be mixed up.
Maybe you still need to process it?
You don't really look like the picture on the box
I don't think I'm ready for a mixed marriage.
You know I can’t understand you when you’re on purée.
What do you mean I make your head spin?
Pulse two times if you're as hungry as I am
Oh Honey, your pulse is racing!
Your Mother was a Waring, and your Father?
What do you mean I'm always messing with your head?
Must you play with your food?
But why is it that every time we get close, you emulsify?
So... do you swallow?
I thought this was a BLIND date.
When I asked you to blend in tonight, you didn’t have to take it so literally.
My friends warned me you were a smoothie."
Are you breaking up with me? Pulse once for "yes," twice for "no."
Well, I came from a blended family too but I tried to not let it get to my head!
I just thought "smoothie operator" in your profile was a typo.
I'm sorry if I made you agitated."
So Reggie Matic isn’t your real name?
Yes, your profile DID say you are a mover and shaker, but . . .
The dating site was right. You’re certainly practical and transparent.
Why do you always mix up everything I say?
You're clearly agitated. Let me check your pulse.
Gee, you're a real smoothie aren't you.
I can’t help thinking you have mixed feelings about our relationship.
I think we should take things at a low speed.
First you shred my heart to pieces, and now this?
You're such a gentleman. My last date chewed with his lid open.
Give me a minute—I’m trying to process what you’re saying.
I’m sorry, I thought Blendr was just a regular dating app.
Hey, Mister Smoothie, my eyes are up here.
"Honestly, that head of yours is filled with mush.
My feelings for you are thoroughly mixed.
Don't chew with your lid open
Must you do that while we’re eating?
Your mother really did tell you to chew your food thirty-two thousand times?
I should have known you were a smoothie.
What's next, thought processing?
He answered "blender" to online dating question "gender?". She assumed it was a typo.
I never would have guesed. What was it like growing up in a blended family?
After five margaritas, I’m amazed you even got here
Try not to blow you lid Tom.  I don't want this to get messy.
I'm good in the kitchen.
It was either this, or dentures.
I just never imagined you'd be quite like this when they said you were a real smoothie.
I hope this is going smoothly
Gesundheit!
Well, as you probably guessed, I come from a blended family.
I don’t understand you when you slur your words.
Well, at least I don't chew with my mouth open, Cindy.
I just don’t think we blend well.
But what if our first child is a coffee maker?
When will you stop trying to blend in?
When you said you came from a blended family....this is not what I expected.
I'm getting a mixed message.
Really Claude, I’m certain that chewing each mouthful  thirty-two times would be sufficient.
You looked different in your profile picture.
I want you to open up, but you keep going around in circles.
Is your pulse racing, too?
Well, on the plus side, I have excellent digestion.
Vita, should I ask the waiter to bring you an extension cord.?
Kid, why would a starlet like you want an old juicer like me?
So you want a blended family.
Harold, what are you Waring?
When I read your profile, I assumed you meant to say you were from a "blended" family.
To be honest your profile picture was a bit deceiving.
I confess I'm shaken-- but not stirred.
I won't mince words. We're over.
I'm glad to see the algorithm matched me with someone who could help in the kitchen!
Interesting! I’m also from a blended family!
When they advertised this dinner as a mixer, I guess I didn’t consider all the possibilities.
Please keep your voice down.  I'm trying to blend in.
Dear, try to focus, I understand it is a lot to process.
Spare me the chop, dice and purée treatment and tell me the truth....do I look fat in this outfit?
Before surgery, I was hideous Nancy. People would stare. All my life I just wanted to blend in.
Yes, I come from a blended family also.
When you say "We are a good Mix", it kind of scares me.
So, Oster, tell me about your family. Where did you say your parents were from?
Perhaps you’re trying a little too hard to blend in
This explains why you didn't ask for utensils.
You mix up everything I say.
Guess how I like my martinis.
I can’t understand you when you’re on purée.
Suddenly, I'm craving a Margarita.
I am not sure speaking blend, mix, purée, and chop makes you multilingual
That would explain the vertigo.
I guess when my girlfriend warned me that you were a real smoothie, I should have listened a little more carefully.
Purée if you must, but no masticating with your lid open
Yes, I think you and I should give it a whirl.
I don’t think I should get mixed up in this.
Can you please not puree with your lid open?
Yes, Carl...I’ve met someone. He’s an Immersion Blender, Carl.  I’m sorry
Barry, you’re sending me mixed messages again.
No, I don't want to see what's in your pants."
OK, I'm getting the sense that you have mixed feelings about us.
I know your profile said you are a man who likes to "mix it up", but I assumed you were speaking figuratively.
Ralph, you try too hard to blend in.
If I'm being honest, you look nothing like your profile picture.
"A blend of mixed, crushed, and frapped. How do you expect me to feel?"
I thought your profile pic meant you liked to eat healthy.
I don’t care if your last date enjoyed it. I’m not letting you do that.
Dad was a lawnmower and mom was a whisk.
You are always mixing up what I'm trying to say.
Sorry.  The last  girl I went on a date with really messed with my head.
Harold, I don’t like when you get juiced up.
You get agitated over the silliness things.
What a coincidence. My name is Brenda too!"
Thank you for not chewing with your lid open.
I, too, just want to blend in.  But I don't let it go to my head.
This is the last time on go on a blind date with someone from the Rotary club.
What do you mean by "mixed feelings"?
I guess I have mixed emotions.
I prefer stirred.
Frappe? On a first date?
Shall we send back our dishes and request the fruit platter and a bucket of ice?
Sorry babe... you just turn me on."
This isn’t working out, your head’s just not in the right place.
Is that yes or no?
When will your new teeth be ready?
I'm afraid you have me mixed up with someone else.
I know we’re at the table but trust me, you don’t want me to take my hat off.
I’ve been getting a lot of mixed messages...
You think this is cool, you should see my showerhead.
When did you first realize you were mixed up?
You're going too fast for me.
I'm not superficial. You just look very different from your profile picture.
Oh honey, you look great! No one will notice that your tie is a clip-on.
I thought you said you had a 'blend' of sophistication and humor.
Honestly, I had no idea that this is what you meant when you said we were going to get juiced tonight!
Don't you think you are taking the liquid diet concept a bit too seriously?
I thought your profile read head of compliance, but I see now your head of appliance.
my friend told me when she arranged this date that you were a good mixer
You might have better luck on Grindr.
I know your profile said that you were a "real smoothie", but...
So you're a vegan?
Whirr, whirr is your response to everything.  It's like you're not even listening.
Dear, it's so much more than a diet. It's a lifestyle.
Would you mind closing your lid when you juice?
I often have mixed emotions, too. Like now, for example.
Don’t turn around, but Insant Pot just walked in.
The worst part is I lost both my hands in a flossing accident.
They told me you were Mr. Smoothie, but I had no idea!
Let me push your buttons.
Your mind seems to be someplace else.
So, when you said I really make your head spin, that's not a good thing?
My friends said you were a smoothie but this is ridiculous!
I won't settle for just a pulse.
You really are an old smoothie!
You're such an extremist. New dentures would have been perfectly fine.
You push my buttons too.
Don't worry, you'll blend in" you said.
I shouldn't HAVE to ask for a knife and fork Susan.
Take off your lid, for God's sake, Jack...people are starting to stare!
I’m from a blended family, too.
All that just to avoid a straw.
It said ‘blind’ date not ‘blend’ date.
You can pulse, you can puree, but can you really listen?
I think I will have a drink after all.
Well your online ad did say you were a great mixer.
I 'm flattered my new sleeveless dress turn's you on
You know I can't hear you when your on Puree!
I knew Sir Mix-a-Lot. I rapped with Sir Mix-a-Lot. You sir, are no Sir Mix-a-Lot.
Darling, I think I know the source of your frequent headaches.
I don't want to be noticed, I just want to blend in.
When you said you were a Ninja, this is not what I expected.
What are you whirring about this time?
Could you chew more softly dear?
You seem to have quite a bit of energy this evening."
Well just don't let them ostracize you.
I wouldn't date just anyone with a pulse
Well, it would simplify the Wedding registry
Tim, please. Every time I bring up wanting kids, you go straight to frappé.
You're such a smoothie
I can see the ideas whirling in your head.
You know, Harold, there are more subtle ways to tune me out during dinner.
OK, OK, so you're really processing my ideas now."
You're Waring me out.
So, do you like to relax on the counter or in the cupboard?
Your profile said you were "Mr. Smooth," not "Mr. Smoothie."
I do not appreciate your mixed messages.
Honey, that's not what I meant when I said, "Try to blend in."
So, are Thursdays always mixer nights?
Well then Walter, why don’t YOU explain what’s wrong in our relationship?
In your profile picture you were a vita-mix....
Having trouble blending in?
Is it my imagination or are you sending me mixed messages?
Whenever I try to talk about my food issues, people say it's all in my head.
I know, my head is spinning, too.
Look, Karen. It’s over. I don’t mince words.
Can you please chew with your lid closed?
I get it. I get it. You just want to blend in.
My last boyfriend was an Oster.
Thank you, I'd love a Mojito.
I've met someone, his name is Oster.
You can't even process why I'm breaking up with you!
'I'm leaving you for a Magic Bullet'.
I get it. You’re a smoothie operator.
I was looking to stir up the conversation, not puree it.
Can you chew a little more quietly,
 please?
Oh honey, I know you are mixed up but just pause for a minute..
So . . . what's your crazy?
No, I don't find your voice grating at all.
You just seem too mixed up for me.
I don't fool around on the first date.  But you're saying if we act now, I get the Salad Spinner AND  the Grab-it?
I’m beginning to think you might be a little mixed up.
Honey, can you at least turn it down from 'puree' to 'stir'
How can you say that I push your buttons?
If I'm completely honest, I hate seeing you chew your food.
'Don't feel bad. Everyone does it. I used a picture from college on my profile.'
So - if I let you spend the night will you make me a smoothie in the morning ?
Do you ever unplug?
I was expecting a totally different type of mixer.
Is it soup yet?
You looked more like a Vitamix online.
You're mixing your metaphors again, Bob.
You took me too seriously when I said we should shake things up a bit.
I'm sorry that was a typo. It was 'blind date.'
I meant a different kind of “blend in”.
It's starting to sound like you think EVERY meal should be paired with a thick and creamy beverage....
You could have worn a tie.
What on earth are you Waring?
So what doesn’t make your head spin?
You upped your Adderall again, didn’t you?
You do make an incredible frozen daquiri, Hamilton, but I'm just not comfortable with a blended family.
Just tell me. Stop mincing your words!
Why do you always try to smooth over everything?
No, that’s not what I said.  You’re always mixing it up.
I know that your head is spinning, maybe you'll feel better if you eat something.
Are you identify as a trans~blender?
Are you sure you want a blended family?
I thought you were grinding just your teeth.
This isn’t quite what I pictured when Carol said you came from a blended family.
Are you working on the soup or dessert?
Well, Mary did say you made a great daiquiri.
I had no idea you were from a blended family.
My last serious relationship was with Mr. Coffee, but he just didn’t blend in with my  friends .
That’s not what I meant when I said I wanted to mix things up.
I get a little stir crazy too.
Where I’m from, men chew their steaks.
I guess I didn't know what the dating site meant by 'foodie'.
Normally I won't go on blind dates, but you were so highly reviewed.
I didn't want to tell you like this, but I've been cheating on you with a cappuccino machine.
Nonsense! Don't worry about how you look.  You blend in very well.
No one can say you don't mince your  words .
I thought you were just being clever with your photo when you described yourself as a "smoothie".
Jeez, Howard, you never turn it off!
Your ad promised 'a blend of attractive qualities' but perhaps you could have been more specific.
Okay, when I said 'try to blend in...'
Are you going to eat that?
You're sending me mixed signals.
This isn’t what I expected at a mixer
Do I blend in?
Try "Pulse."
Right. Purée. That's your answer for everything.
Now I really do feel ostracized.
No, I don't juice.
Can we talk about just "unplugging" for a bit?
It's funny. I came from a blended family, too.
We  need to talk. Can you slow down to puree for a minute?
I am leaving you Phil.  You were the one that wanted to mix things up so please stop trying to spin this into something else.
I knew making a dating profile on Blendr was a bad idea...
I'm flattered you ask, but no, I don't think I want to give it a whirl.
I know!  It makes my head spin !
Why are you sending me mixed signals?
Sheila said you were a real smoothie.
Your profile did say you were raised in a blended family, but I wasn’t expecting this.
What do you mean you're having impuree thoughts?
If you're not going to use silverware, could you at least set that to low?
As long as I don't drop the fork inside, it's quite convenient
So, what is working at Fox News really like?
So your Tinder profile mentioned that you're on a juice cleanse?
Oh, you smoothy you.
Am I chewing too loud?
You come across as so smooth, Mr. Oster, but inside you're really mixed up.
It was cheaper than dental insurance.
That's not what I meant when I said, "Just try to blend in".
I told you it would make your head spin.
Why couldn't you have worn that nice Vitamix I got you?"
I’m feeling a lot of mixed emotions
Truth time: I really have only 23 settings.
I usually avoid coming to these types of mixers.
Why must you always twist everything I say?
I didn't know blending in was so important to you.
James, I thought you'd be stirred, not shaken.
I still can’t believe that I met you at a mixer.
I get names and faces mixed up sometimes too!
Common mistake, I get his mail all the time. But I'm Edward Blenderface.
You thought I was kidding when I said that seeing food always turns me on.
I know you’re supposed to chew your food 32 times before swallowing, but this is ridiculous.
So, your digestion has been better since the transplant?
Yes, Nancy did mention you were from a blended family
This is not what I was expecting when I signed up for the company mixer.
Could you slow down, dear? This isn't fast food.
I was hoping you’d try solid food this evening.
I know on your profile you said you blend in well with others but....
My late husband was an old smoothie.
I think the dating site misunderstood my desire to blend with someone.
You're an idiot.  It's on backwards.
I think dental implants would have been more aesthetically pleasing.
This conversation just keeps going in circles!
And they said you can’t find love on Grindr.
I’m getting mixed messages.
You are related to Edward Scissorhands?
Are you having mixed feelings about our relationship?
Were you as surprised as I was by your DNA results?
That’s a stirring story. But you’ve whipped yourself up into purée.
Good God, I can't wait to get you into bed and set you at puree.
It was so much easier talking to you when your eyes just glazed over.
I know I said in my profile I wanted to mix things up, but I didn't think anyone would take it literally.
I guess your dental plan wouldn't cover the implants.
I sense you're having mixed emotions about our relationship.
So when you shared in your profile that you were a little mixed up you weren't speaking metaphorically?
I totally thought you meant something else by blended family.
Where do you get your energy?
That's funny, I grew up in a blended family too
Most people would have gone with false teeth.
It's so embarrassing.  I wish you had worn your other jacket.
I don't want to get mixed up in this.
A penny for what's going around in that head of yours.
In your profile you looked more like a Vitamix...
I’m sorry Dorothy, but the Mueller report just makes my head spin.
No, to be frank Frank, you don’t blend in like you think.
Frankly, I preferred your dentures.
I hardly know what to say.  My head is spinning.  Not like yours though.
I must admit I wasn’t sure what to expect when I got the email about the faculty mixer.
I thought I'd give Tinder a try, but in reality, I'm more of a Grindr kind of guy.
I think it really only makes it harder for you to blend in.
I think you're trying too hard to blend in.
So try chewing slowly and savoring for once.
Do you have a pause button?
I thought your profile said 'mixed race,' not 'mixed face.'
You can take it off now - they've gone.
Look, I'm not ostracizing you. I just can't get mixed up with you right now.
I still find your story hard to swallow.
No problem. My ex-husband was part lawnmower."
This is the last time I get a date from Blendr.
I'll grant you this--you're a smoothie.
Any relation, Brian, to Edward Scissorhands?
I don't think we're a good blend.
Yeah, I have mixed feelings.
I am not sure I am ready for a blended family.
Your Blendr profile was so accurate."
Maybe you should cut back on watching cable news.
I meant to try Grindr, not Mixr.
Stop looking so nervous. Just try to blend in.
I'm getting mixed signals.
Would you please turn it to vibrate
I'm really growing tired of your mixed messages.
So this is your favorite setting...
Digestive enzymes would have been an easier solution, Harold.
So, how long have you been on grinder?
Your profile indicated that you were blender neutral and I'm okay with that.
I love how ideas just pour out of you.
You're not blending in, here.
Can you at least try chewing?
I guess I thought “Blender” was an actual dating site
John, I can't take your mixed signals any longer.
Haha yeah, all I’m saying is that if you’ve got a type b electrical outlet under that dress than we might be able to make this work
Do you remember your setting the night we met?
Well yes, you DO blend right in, but...
When I said I wanted to mix things up, this isn't what I had in mind.
I'm looking for Mr. Right not Mr. Coffee.
So how many speeds do you have?
My last boyfriend was a toaster oven. He was a real hothead.
I’m sorry, did you say “three speeds” or “special needs?”
So what exactly is the difference between "whip" and "liquefy"
Why do you always twist my words?
Still  processing your work day?
I want you to know that my intentions are puree.
Is it too soon to ask what our kids will look like?
I'm not the one who's mixed up, dear.
You're just an old smoothy, aren't you.
I can never tell what's going round in your head.
Actually, you're starting to grate on me.
Harold, you've taken your need to blend in a little too far.
Have you tried meditation?
Why don't you switch off the smooth talk and give it to me raw.
It looks like you have mixed feelings about me.
I picked this quiet setting so we could talk
Can't you go anywhere without getting juiced?
You're just not up to speed, Albert.
You look shaken.
But I bought the Cuisinart long before I met you.”
True, your profile did say you blend in well.
Don't get so dramatic... I just want you to chew your food properly.
I'm ready to take this relationship from "chop" to "puree"
I'm done mixing. I'm leaving you for a slow cooker.
You were wrong. You don't blend in at all.
Pass it to me under the table so that we don't draw attention!
Can't you just blend in for once?
You're a smoothie,I'll give you that.
I find that mixing it up on a first date keeps things interesting.
You’re not blending in.
Look  , I don't want to mince words or anything else with you.
So, was it rough growing up in a blended family?
So how did you end up becoming a bartender?
its obvious that you view me with mixed emotions
Not exactly what I meant, when I said to try and blend in.
I guess I’m one of those gentlemen who prefer blends.
Well, I interpreted it differently when you said on the dating site that my picture made your head spin.
It’s obvious your mind is somewhere else.
Okay, so your profile did say you were into juicing...
You plan on getting juiced tonight?
Frank, I think your winning the Appliance Salesperson of the Year Award has gone to your head.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little different than your profile picture.
So, your mother was the toaster?
I wish you would try harder to blend in.
It must be tough to blend in.
So your mother was a dish washer or dishwasher?
Why yes, I would love a margarita.
What do you mean you did your own circumcision?
I'm afraid I'm just not ready to be in a blended family.
I can hear what you’re thinking.
You whir saying...?
I'm looking for someone who isn't afraid to unplug.
Really?  THAT makes your head spin?
No, I won't take your lid off!
Would you mind turning that off; I can't understand a word you're saying!
No, thanks. I prefer to chew and swallow.
I'm sorry, you just remind me too much of my mother.
Tom, you old smoothie.
Your  profile , touting your ability to blend in, is a bit misleading.
Ok, so you're a little mixed up.
I hate it when you  make noise when you chew.
No, I would not like another margarita
Yeah, so I think it's perfect that you put your own spin on everything....really.
On the rocks would have been fine.
Oh, listen to me go on and on.
I’m just trying to blend in.
I still think implants would have been the better choice.
So, your ad mentioned you like Pina Coladas?”
You're quite the smoothie talker.
No, the constant whirring doesn’t bother me at all. It’s the lying that I can’t stand.
No. I'm not really surprised. I read on your profile that you work as a spin doctor.
I can see you have mixed feelings
Well, I'm not surprised. They did warn me that you were a real smoothie.
No, it's not me who's mixed up.  It's definitely you.
Are you sure you don't need utensils?
I don’t know that I can ignore the problems of a blended family!
How was the salad?
Is that REALLY the only way you can eat your vegetables?
I’ve told you before, I can’t understand you on purée.
I'm getting a mixed message from you.
Honestly, Frank, blending in with the crowd doesn't have to be so difficult.
I’m nervous to tell my parents we met on Blendr.
Well, at least you don't have to floss.
This was not what I expected when you called yourself a "Sunbeam" in your profile.
I can tell your agitated.
You look more like a food processor in your photo.
I did say I like pina coladas  and getting caught in the rain.
On second thought, I'd prefer watching you chew with your mouth open.
I can’t get a whirred in edgewise.
Aren’t you tired of the same old grind ?
You're too mixed up. I'm leaving you for the toaster
I said I wanted to date a smooth operator, not a smoothie operator.
Oh dear, it sounds like you chipped a blade on an olive pit.
So, how long have you been a blender?
Well what did you expect when we met on blndr
It's the straw, isn't it?
Don't be so upset . . . I didn't say "foreplay"! I said "frappe" . . .
Just eat the burger, Frank. All this juicing is really going to your head.
I prefer to chew my food.
You look so different from your profile picture.
Sorry.  Lately I feel very mixed up.
Darth Vader could breathe and talk at the same time.
It’s over. I’m dating an InstaPot
I've never dated a Ninja before.
I'm sorry there must have been a mix-up.
So you say you’re from a blendered  family?
Why do you always have to stir things up?
Don’t blame the waiter, Jay. You’re the one who mixed up the order.
You're not as smooth as you think.
I thought you were a different kind of ninja.
I'm having mixed feelings about where this is going
It's nice that I make your head spin, but then, so does fruit and yogurt
You really have a knack for putting a spin on everything I say
It was bad enough when you parsed everything I said, but pureeing is too much.
Why do you have to be "on" all the time?
You ever go to sleep at night and feel like your head is just spinning?
This is the problem right here, you keep sending mixed signals.
Mother thinks you spend too much time in the kitchen"
You really know how to put your own 'spin' on things !
Well - it's difficult, but I have to tell you: I've been seeing a lot of the InstaPot, and I think I'm falling in love...
Make up your mind, John.
Ed ‘you are what you eat!!’ Seriously. ..Lay off the processed food !
You look exactly how I feel.
I've never dated a mixologist before.
No matter what spin you put on it, the answer is still no.
I understand. I come from a blended family too.
No, my name is Brenda.
If you could have any superpower, what would it be?
I'm sorry, you must have me mixed up with someone else.
Not what I expected at the blind date mixer
So, do I get the Piña Colada from you or the waiter?
I heard you were a mixer, but didn’t realize you blended so well
Is it that hard to eat your words?
Psst - this may send you haywire
but I was anticipating a mixer, not a blender.
I had a completely different idea when you said you came from a blended family.
It’s not that I mind how you eat, I just don’t like to watch it.
This is not what I meant by writing that I was interested in a whirlwind romance.
Thank you, I can chew my own food.
Monica was right. You’re a real smoothie.
Relax, its not a plastic straw.
By this time of night, my mind also turns to mush.
You meet the most interesting people on Blendr.
I thought she said she met you at a mixer.
Do you snore?
I just thought we could mix things up a little tonight
I like my men shaken, not stirred.
I push your buttons!#/?
Easter. Not Oster.
So you can eat anything as long as it's cut into appropriately sized cubes?
Have you considered a knife and fork?
'"I wish you would try to blend in."
Let me guess. You can't get your head around it?
I can see you've got mixed feelings for me
Jim, I think you're taking this liquid diet a little too far.
I told you not to use the pulse setting in public, Roger.
I'm sorry, Andy. You're just too mixed up for me.
Are you telling me you have mixed feelings?
I can see you have mixed feelings for me, but maybe you could give it a whirl.
When it comes to small talk, you sure are a smoothie.
Can you keep it on low?  You're embarrassing me.
Well, I WAS warned you were a real smoothie!
So you say your parents met at the laundromat?
Are you alright, Greg? You seem a bit shaken up.
I guess I'm just looking for a more solid commitment.
While I appreciate the margarita, I don't think we're a match.
Why can't you just use a straw?
Honey you're embarrassing me, take it down to a puree"
Well t there's no reason to go straight to liquefy.
I'm having second thoughts about a blended family.
My old boyfriend would always chew with his lid open.
Honestly, I thought you said you were going on a 'bender'.
So where are you on the frappé/purée spectrum?
So that was what you meant when your profile said that you were a "a mover and a shaker."
Stop twisting my words.
Would it offend you if I said that I didn't like smoothies?
I love you Don, but do you really think a blended family would work?
I'm sorry - am I giving you too much information for a first date?
I'm sorry Charles, but this relationship isn't going to work. I already have a blender.
Having mixed feelings about our date?
I can't talk to you when you're pulsating.
What is that you are Waring?
What’s wrong honey? Lately I think your head is somewhere else.
You look different in the Infomercial.
You’re mixed up.
I'm sorry if I seem surprised.  I thought my friend told me your ancestors were Shakers.
Why do you mix, puree, or emulsify everything I say?
I'm sorry Becky, my feelings are just all mixed up right now.
You seem a whole lot happier since you cut the cord.
Conversation with you has become such a grind.
I promise you, you are blending in just fine...
Exactly how are you related to Fred Waring?
I didn't think my opinion would make your head spin.
When I said I wanted to take things to the next level, I didn’t mean frappe.
This is moving at too variable a speed for me.
I thought I would be having dinner with the other Wolf Blitzer.
I met my first wife at a mixer.
Do you always have to use "Pulse" in public?
I don't know, Jim.  Becoming a blended family is a big step, and I'll just have to think about it.
We have to talk.
So, you chose this over a feeding tube?
Was the surgery painful?
I didn't know you had mixed feelings about us!
This date is making my head spin too.
I just wish I could unplug more often.
You seem a little shaken up.
It may not be the most attractive solution but it's a lot cheaper than implants and it seems to be improving my sleep apnea as well.
This is not the kind of mixer I had in mind.
I've grown accustomed to your face, but that constant whirring noise is still a relationship breaker for me.
I just  like to make my own Margaritas, that's all.
Maybe you should go back to your dentures.
Honestly, you're Waring me out . . . .
Just makes your head spin, doesn't it?
How could I turn you down? You’re such a smoothie.
Well,okay,your profile did say you were quite the smoothie.
So, what keeps you going?
So...you are still juicing, I see.
Well when you said reconstructive surgery I....
I must have misread your profile. I thought you were from a “blended” family.
You did say you wanted a man who could make margaritas.
The very idea! It just makes your head spin, doesn't it?
Maybe we should ask for the head waiter?
I’m don’t blend well, but I am a good mixer.
Usually they frown upon bringing in outside beverages.
You seem to be mixing your metaphors...
You should have opted for gastric bypass surgery instead.
...it's just I swore your profile said you were from a "mixed" family.
Why are you surprised? My dating profile clearly said my heritage was mixed.
Just how mixed up are your feelings about me?
This guy has one setting.
Honey you look shaken.
I guess you never made a fuss
when your peas touched your
potatoes.
Honestly...everyone is staring! Put it on the 'low' setting...and don't get ice in your drinks from now on!
So what was it like growing up in blended family?
Chew with your mouth closed, Jerry"
So this is what you meant when you said you came from a blended family
I can’t get Margaritaville out of my head.
Don't worry, I get more interesting once I add a little alcohol.
But why don't you just order soup??
I'm sorry Steve, ever since my doctor said no more frozen margaritas, I no longer find you attractive.
Where does it come out?
Nod if I should push the Heimlich button.
You weren't kidding when you wrote "mush for brains" on your dating profile
I didn’t think you’d be so shaken, it was just a fling.
It's not going to work out. You're always mixing things up.
I'm sorry, I just don't think you have your head screwed on straight.
Are you still suffering from those dizzy spells?
I'm not so sure it's an improvement over your dentures.
You seem so mixed up
The last few days were magical, but I’m not ready for a blended family
I shouldn’t say this but you remind me of my ex. You might have heard of him, Mr. Coffee.
You are mixed up. Aren't you?
Blender? I hardly know her.
This isn't working out for me. Talking to you makes my head spin.
It certainly was cheaper than the dental work.
I wanted to blend in.
It's a five star restaurant for heaven's sake, choose blend, not liquify!
Believe me, this is better than dentures.
Whatever is going on inside that head of yours is all mixed up
Your three wishes could have used spellcheck.
Sometimes, I just don’t know what you’re thinking
I feel my life is spinning out of control
You really aren't like the other guys.
When I asked you to blend in, this is not what I had in mind”
How did you get so mixed up?
I'm sorry, I'm just looking for more of an immersion blender kind of guy.
Turn it off now, you're blending in just fine.
You’ve been on Agitate mode ever since I ordered my Margarita on the rocks
I hate these social mixers.
You're not what I expected from a Grindr date.
I see you have MIXED feelings about me"
And why should I believe you're not like the other smoothies I've dated?
You and your damn liquid diet.
Sorry, I just get so spun up when people push my buttons.
I’m not a fan of mixers
I said I was sorry I ordered the milkshake; can't you drop it?
I feel that our conversations just go around and around.
Why can’t you just chew like a normal person?
Steak a little tough?
I'm mixed up, too...
I prefer men with a juicer.
No thanks, I'll cut up my own meat.
That's not what I meant when I told you you should blend in
Blah, blah, blah. You and your mixed feelings.
It might have been better if you just had your teeth fixed.
I thought you were kidding when you said you were worried about blending in.
I can see those wheels turning.
The margaritas are on me!
You're a little mixed up, aren't you?
I don't think it was the waiter who mixed up your order.
I thought your profile said you were from a ‘blended’ family.
I know a little about blended families myself
Can you stop being so "on" all the time?
I thought you'd be on Grindr
So, "blenderhead'" isn't a nickname?
How long have you had mixed feelings about us?
I see you’re still trying to process my pregnancy news.
Oh, so you're a Cuisinartist.
Im sorry, but your friend left out the blender head part.
I thought we met on Tinder, not Blender.
So I chew each mouthful a hundred times.  I don't appreciate sarcasm.
So, I understand you come from a blended family.
Do you have a smoother setting?
"I just want to know if you love me.  How much longer do you need to process?
Let’s break the ice.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to push all our buttons.
Your profile did say that you could get my juice flowing.
I can't understand a word you're saying when you're on puree...
Honestly, sometimes I can't tell if your shredding or pureeing.
Why on earth would you take 'mush for brains' literally, Fred?
I might understand you better if you stay on the chop setting.
Frankly, I was expecting a little more from the A.I. community.
Your dating app profile said you like to mix things up.
It's not you, Lucy, it's me. I just feel so mixed-up inside!
You're giving me a lot of mixed signals.
To be honest l thought your profile said you grew up in a blended family
I guess that I misunderstood when you said that you enjoy blending in.
This wasn't the mixer I had in mind.
Did you consider dental implants?
Sorry dear...
This whole lifetime guarantee thing isn't working out.
You realize that straw will end up in the ocean.
You said you had a blended family?
Can you please chew quietly?
I think you’re processing what I’m saying very well!
My last appliance was a toaster...... he was a real “hot head”.
I feel great, except for the tinnitus.
Open the lid, I can't hear you.
I don't know why it's quite such an obsession to blend in everywhere.
I was hoping for a quiet dinner
To be fair, we've both been sending mixed signals.
John, I'm sensing that you have mixed feelings.
You had me at Puree.
When I asked you to wear something that would blend in, this isn't exactly what I had in mind...
I don’t subscribe to traditional gender roles; I’m very comfortable in the kitchen.
Please stop whining.
All the girls in the office said you were a bit of a smoothie.
I get that question all the time and, honestly, it's not as much of a problem as you might think.
I thought I’d meet more people at a mixer.
This is perfect since I can't stand the sound of chewing
She ended things after our first kiss.
Must you go on?
Sorry if I'm a little awkward. This is my first Blendr date.
Why can's you chew like everyone else?
You've let this health drink thing go to your head.
I really wish you'd just get a set of dentures.
No, I won’t sleep with you - but IF  you really are Donald Trump, it would explain a lot of things!
Well, you also make my head spin !
Once you're done thinking, can you pour us the drinks?
Oh, I misunderstood.  You said MASTICATOR.
All I said was, “Please don’t talk with your mouth full.”
I think there's been a bit of a mix up.
I wish you would just take a laxative like everyone else.
I thought you said you were from a BLENDED family.
That frozen daquiri went straight to my head.
It’s my tie, isn’t it?
Let's go somewhere louder after this.
I understand you come from a blended family?
Could you not pulse during the entree?
Actually, I don’t like pina coladas OR getting caught in the rain.
Well yes your profile did say you were a mixologist but I thought you meant it as more of a profession."
Sorry, I don't swallow on the first date.
I have mixed feelings about you.
...and so after another horrible Tinder date, I thought I'd try Blender.
Actually,  you DON'T blend in.
Burgers for our 10th anniversary? Don’t even try to smooth talk your way out of this one, Max.
Yes Mr. Mixer there is a lot to be said for you.  However, I was hoping the dating agency would match me up with Mr. Vibrator.
"I don't kiss on the first date.
...so,everyone calls you Mr. Smoothie?
Just what did your ad mean by 'blended family'?
Uh, no thanks, I really don't think I'm ready to push your "Liquify" button.
Well, I chew each bite 32 thousand times before swallowing.
I like Sir Mix-a-Lot too!
I told you not to go to Tijuana for your gastro-bypass surgery.
I’m just saying it’s funny that my name is Brenda!
Most just chew their food
You’re soooo mixed up lately!
No wonder you have mixed emotions.
When you said you just wanted to blend in, this isn't what I had in mind.
When they said this was a mixer I didn't expect...
The site of our first date. You old smoothie.
You're mixed up?  What about me?
Do you have to do that in public?
Don’t be so dramatic George, we can just ask for cutlery!
Why wouldn't I assume that the text invitation was an autocorrect error for 'blind date' ?
When I read that you blend in well, I could not have seen this"
Who turned you on?
Stop trying to blend in
I take it you are from a blended family.
I identify more as a bread maker.
Don't worry honey, you're blending right in.
This was your idea of a quiet setting?
Yes, this is my first blend date.
I understood you to say you were from a 'blended'  family!
I want a divorce.  I can no longer stomach your machinations.
It's all been such a whirl
I have to say you use  filters very effectiveley on your tinder picture
I feel like I'm getting mixed messages from you.
Honestly Herb, could you please chew more quietly?
Yeah, watching too much Fox News will do that to you.
You’re constantly mixing up what I say
For once in your life, Jim, just cut the spin.
I misunderstood when you said you had a head for mixed drinks.
Don't worry. You'll blend in just fine.
You're too mixed up for me.
So that's why your personal ad said you like to blend in.
So you were raised in a blended family?
Take a sip of water....it might help.
So you stick to processed foods?
I'd prefer you go back to chewing every mouthful 32 times before swallowing.
How do you like this settting?
Can't you see you're wasting away in Margaritaville?
When you said let's mix it up a bit, I had a different image.
...but the thing is... you can eat whatever you want.
I'm leaving you for a Thermomix.
There you go, mixing metaphors again!
It's great you can blend, grind, mince and chop — but I only wanted a man who can stir fry.
So... what is your mother like?
When you said you were a real smoothie I thought you were joking.
When I wrote in my profile that I was open to a blended family, I had something else in mind.
For starters, I don't do it counter clockwise on the first date.
What are your hobbies, besides juicing?
It sounds like you're saying that you have mixed feelings for me?"
So Oscar, You were from a blended family?
Not to be rude, but you looked way different in your photos on the app.
Could it just be ADHD?
...so they never found your head.
What’s that you’re Waring?
Honey, this is not what I meant by "Try to blend in"!
Your profile didn't mention your blended family.
I thought this app was called Grindr!
Will you stop looking around the room and pay me some attention.
Don't look shocked, everyone says  that I blend in."
Would dentures really have been all that bad?
How long were you on the liquid diet?
When you said you really felt like a Margarita, I thought you either wanted a cocktail, or were coming out as a woman!
I think you'll blend injust fine.
Not exactly what I meant when I said I wanted someone who blends well with others.
Well, they just told me it was a mixer.
A penny for your sauce.
Perhaps you should get those dental implants.
We're just at different settings right now.
It's not so bad. My last boyfriend was a peckerhead.
You're giving me mixed signals.
A blended family is not what I had in mind.
What was it like growing up in a blended family?
Like I said in my profile, I like to mix things up.
I do appreciate a man who's helpful in the kitchen.
I can tell when you're upset, Dan.
Just turn yourself to off and serve me a daiquiri.
This is not what I meant when I said I thought we should mix things up
I've always been a good mixer. How about you?
You're quite the smooth operator
What do you mean you don't vote?
You're making my head spin.
Your dating profile said that you, "like to mix it up".
But Ashley, I recall your profile saying open to a blended family?
I didn't realize you came from a blended family, too.
I know on the dating app I said I wanted a blended family, but maybe I need to rethink this...
I know. I get that feeling too when I forget my meds.
Oh Marty, do you have to put a spin on everything?
I’ll ask for another straw.
I was hoping to smooth things out tonight.
Well, personally, I have very mixed emotions on the issue. But you wouldn't understand that, would you?
I have mixed feeling about that.
I like to mix it up a bit, you know?
I can see why you love dating mixers.
Method acting is fine, Mark, but you don’t have to BE the shake to drink one.
You don’t seem like other men.
As usual, you have everything mixed up.
Blenderhead is Marvel, not DC.
I'm sorry. I assumed this gathering was more of a mixer event.
You are one mixed up dude.
WHAT? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK UP!
Sure you can chop. But I need someone who can frappe and liquify.
I can see you have mixed feelings about this relationship
My head is spinning too.
How would I have known that being invited to a mixer would turn out like this?
I'm more of a single malt girl.
For the hundredth time, no. A frozen margarita would not hit the spot right now.
Answer me! Don't just shake your head.
Would you think it too forward of me if I asked for a picture of your dick?
Why do you have to mix everything up?
So how long have you been on your juice cleanse?
You really are mixed up!
Your profile said you like to mix things up, but I had no idea you were so committed.
Jesus Harry. That's not what I meant when I told you to blend in.
You had me at 'VRVRRVRChzzzz'
You could have just ordered the bisque....
I must have a type. My last boyfriend was Eraserhead.
I think it's inappropriate to ask me to drop the food in your head, particularly on a first date.
Its cheaper than dentures.
Cindy said you were handy in the kitchen.
There must be some kind of mix up
Must you always get a buzz on before dinner?
Slow down, I can’t understand what you’re saying.
John, I love the way you multitask and process at the same time.
Honestly, every time I bring up where our relationship is going you go all frappe on me.
Don´t stir at me like this!
Frankly, you're starting to grate on my nerves.
Must you chew so loudly?
Your profile says you are a mover and shaker.
When they said this was a mixer, I didn’t take it literally
I told you to wear something to blend in!
Oh, I do a mix of things.
Have you tried chewing with your blade on pulse instead of purée?
Honey, no matter how hard you try, you'll never blend in.
' I'm having mixed feelings about our relationship'
After months of internet dating, they all seemed to blend together
I'm sorry, but guys who are too smooth make me suspicious
Honey, it's not polite to speak with your blender full.
Dearest, could you please chew more quietly?
Am I right that you're a foodie?
In the personal ad you said you were a Ninja.
Eating out was more fun before you started juicing...
I have to admit I thought "Blender Head"  meant something like  "Parrot Head" or "Dead Head".
I was hoping you were more of a juicer.
Honey, I think you turn me on.
Does the doctor have any idea what's causing your headaches?
Yes, you really do have Braun eyes, don't you...?
This is what I get for swiping right on Blender.
I wish you wouldn't mix your metaphors
When you said you were a blender on match.com, I had no idea
So every time we kiss, I get a free drink?
I disagree - Your profile photo does do you justice.
Shake? No, I said I wanted a BREAK in our relationship!
When your profile said you were a processor, I envisioned something different...
I don't care how hard you try, you're never going to blend in.
I'm sorry. I can't tell you anything about my childhood; it's all a blur.
Your profile said you were a real smoothie.
Thank you for having lunch with me.  I’ve been feeling ostracized!
Trump has everyone's head spinning, Harry.
Sheila said you were a Smoothie operator.
Smooth, real smooth.
They say the secret of blending in is not trying too hard.
Unfortunately, this is the only relationship I've had that's lived up to its lifetime guarantee.
You're quite the smoothie aren't you!
I cannot wait to see your 23 and me results!
You look like your head is spinning
I had a different kind of whirlwind relationship in mind
I just miss the way you whir.
I just don't think I could deal with a mixed marriage.
I know my story may be hard to digest.
How about using your fork, instead?
I don’t frappé but I do enjoy the occasional pulse.
Your photo on Match.com looked younger.
I know you're mixed up, John, but I can't be the one to fix you.
I'm open to the idea of a blended family.
Oh my God, I thought it said Speed Eating...
will you please stop grinding your teeth?
What's wrong? I thought you said this place was just your speed."
Do you attend many social mixers?
I don't think we should see each other again, Mr. Waring.
I'm not sure I'm ready for a blended family.
When you mentioned a blended family in you profile, I thought...
I'm one less appliance you'll have to put on our wedding registry.
I'm so glad we met at the mixer.
When Betty invited me to a singles mixer, this isn't quite what I had in mind.
This is a fine dining restaurant. Where's your tie?
Calm down - your pulse is going crazy.
First dates usually go pretty smoothly for me.
I just have a lot of mixed emotions right now.
When you said in your dating profile you were looking to start a "blended family", this isn't what I pictured.
I didn't believe them when they said you were a real smoothie.
I told you not to cancel your dental insurance.
‘You didn’t mention this on your Tinder profile.’
Let's mix things up a bit.
I'm fine with a blended family.
Since you seem to like options, here are several to choose from before I walk away: a) I'm not into whirlwind romance.  b) That's not what "blended family" means. c) "you have my head spinning" is the cheesiest line I've ever heard.
I used to date a juicer.
That first sip of wine always gets my head spinning...
I feel like you keep sending me mixed signals.
Do you meet a lot of women on Craigslist
Since when did a smoothie become your answer for everything?
No, that doesn't turn me on.
Do you have to make so much noise chewing?
Thank goodness the daily grind is over
Oh no, that's not why they call me 'Mr. Smoothie'...
I thought you would be stirring, but you're an old smoothie.
Now that we’ve met face-to-face, I understand why you’ve felt mixed up lately.
“Nonsense - lots of couples don’t blend well at first.”
She wasn't kidding. You really are a smoothie.
I can't get mixed up with someone like you.
I’m also from a blended family.
I’ve never met anyone else who really understands what’s going on in my head.
Are you happy with our relationship? You're giving me mixed messages..
This is the last time I get a date from the Shopping Network.
I guess it's my fault for picking a dating app that promised to shake things up
You are such a smooth talker!
That's not what I meant when I said, "blend in".
I admit it was a lot of fun when we met in college, but these days you just don't know when to shut it off.
Must you purée everything I say?
Just once, try chewing your food!
They tell me you are quite the smoothie
I know you said you were mixed up but I never expected this
Don’t deny it... you’ve just come off another weekend blender.
But I do need a straw.
You put your own spin on everything!
Yes, a frozen margarita would be nice.
Do I make your head spin or are you just happy to see me?
How are things going with your new therapist, dear?
You’re the perfect blend of every man I’ve known.
I like your hat.
Want me to check your pulse?
your head looks like a fuckin blender
I just don't think this relationship has a pulse.
You really looked more like a mixer in your profile picture.
Really makes your head spin, right?
Is this your first date on Blender?
I want a divorce.
My ex was a Cuisnart
I’m sorry this blind date isn’t working out. I’m really mixed up at the moment.
When you said you sometimes mix your metaphors, I didn't think you meant literally.
You should lay off the news for a while.
Please stop that: it's quite grating.
Sure, after dinner we can go for a spin.
I don't smoothie until at least the third date.
Blended family background?
You old smoothie you!
Sorry, I don't have a speed date setting.
You look a bit mixed up
You really do blend in!
Exactly what do you mean by blending our families
I just don't think we turn each other on like we used to.
Are you ok? You seem like your head is spinning.
It’s all a blur now.
Puree" means you're angry, right
So coming from a blended family really messed up your mind?
Yes, I did say I wanted to meet someone who’s interests would blend well with mine, but you’re a bit too much!
Your profile did mention a tendency toward racing thoughts
Maybe you should go back on Paxil.
What do you mean there's been a mix up?
Why can't you just blend in?
Well, you're sure equipped to be a spin doctor.
Honey, relax, you blend right in.
I come from a blended family.
You don't look like your photo on the website.
I'm sorry Harold but a blended family isn't an option for me.
... everything must taste the same to you.
“Do you think people know that we met on Blendr?”
I thought this date would have gone smoother.
Sorry -- I keep mixing my metaphors.
I’m not sure a blended family will work out for us.”
Oh Charles, I just can’t help having mixed feelings about you.
My personal add read " I want a mover and shaker."
I think I liked you better on Puree'.
'I prefer my margarita stirred.'
Why is it everywhere we go you insist on blending in?
I see why you talk so much about getting out of the daily grind.
Don't try to lie to me! I can see your thoughts whirling in your head!
No, I don't mind that you leave your hat on.
I could never blend in.
Isn't this taking a liquid diet a little too far?
Do you want to go somewhere quieter?
Be honest with me, Jake. Are you on high tonight ?
And my mom always said my place was in the kitchen!
But what really concerns me is the frog.
But I thought YOU wanted a blended family!
I'm sensing you have mixed feelings about our date.
I'm so confused, Hamilton, by
your constant blending of fact with fiction.
I take it you'll be having the soup
I'm guessing that you might have come from a blended family.
Do you really think this is what our therapist meant when she recommended shaking things up a bit?
Please stop. You're making my head spin.
You would do well to change your setting from agitate to smoothie.
I’ve never seen such a clear demonstration of Hegelian thought!
So you were saying... you needed a change of setting?
I've been told you're a real smoothie.
I usually like to just blend in too.
So how's the juice cleanse going?
I always wanted somebody who could mix things up, but now I’m not really sure.
Honey, the bow tie looks fine.
Shall we tell your mother we met on Blendr?
And this is better than dental implants because . . .
So tell me about your shelf."
so that's how you plan to smooth things over?
Your pulse setting is much more pleasant at dinner.
But your profile said you were a Vitamix.
PLEASE tell me that is not what you thought a blended family is.
So I'm guessing you come from a blended family?
You really needn't try so hard to blend in.
If you don't slow down, your brain is going to go to mush!
I have never been on a blend date before
I’m having a hard time believing your intentions are puree.
Yes, your profile mentioned mixed ethnicity.
What's wrong? It's like your head is in a million places but here.
Blender? I hardly even know her! “

“Jeff, you’ve got to stop making that joke to every waiter we have...
It's over, Tony- I'm not the toaster you want me to be.
I can barely hear myself think around you.
Is that a plastic straw????!!??!
I get it, you were on a blender last night
It's not you, it is me.  Depending on the settings, I get mixed emotions.
I'm sorry; maybe a younger woman could handle your settings.
I need time honey, I just can't whip up everything like you.
You are smooth operator.
Don't say that you're a smoothie  operator.
I don't think we blend well.
Wow, you are one smoothie talker.
I'm having trouble processing this news.
You know I can't hear you when that's running.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you seem a bit mixed-up.
Is it blend or mix during sex?
Honey, you wouldn't need that thing if you chewed your food properly before swallowing.
I’m sorry, I just don’t want to get mixed up in all that.
For the last two years I've been dating small kitchen appliances, so I might be a little nervous
This is all becoming quite Waring for me.
Let me guess, you told the bartender how to make a margarita
I think I’d rather order dessert off the menu.
When your head stops spinning, I'm concerned what will come pouring out.
Bob, I think you've had enough margaritas.
I think there's been a mix-up
You know, it's rude to talk with food in your mouth.
You can't really expect me to cut up your food for you.
Sorry. My mind is awhirl.
No, you’ve got it all mixed up.
I tend to prefer table top mixers."
I’m a little shaken up from my last relationship but ready to move on.
Don't worry, I think you blend right in.
Why yes, I do enjoy a good daiquiri. Why do you ask?
I’m still not sure about blended families.
No wonder your profile on match.com said you blended in well with others.
You don't look anything like your profile picture...
‘You’re not going to like where mine is...’
Quit trying to smoothie this over.
I told you that was the wrong lid.
My gosh Ralph, you’re such a smoothie.
When you said that you could mix your own drinks, this is not what I had in mind.

Honey, you just have one of those faces that just blends into the crowd.
I've never heard of a 'Mixed Masters' degree.
When are you going to tell the children?
I wish you'd stop trying to blend in here, Donald.
I'm very good in the kitchen.
Oh dear, I knew I shouldn't have mentioned Donald Trump!
Wait - was that a No, or are you still chewing?
If you had opted for dentures or implants instead of a blender, you wouldn’t need a power cord right now.
I'm getting a lot of mixed signals right now
Ed, I  just wanted to blend our families.
I'll be honest, this wasn't what I expected when your profile described you as "mixed."

Weren't you listening? Where is your head these days?
I apologize in advance for whatever comes out. I don't have an off switch.
Your pressure to start a blended family  is Waring on me.
i know, my head is spinning too with all the trumpian lies
So...chewing twenty times wasn't enough?

Why are you always so mixed up?
Do I have any corn stuck in my blades?
I guess it is easier than asking the waiter to do it for you.
How's the tinnitus?
I don't think I can handle a blended family.
Nothing personal. I don’t kiss on the first date.

Remember to chew each mouth-full 20 times per second.
No, I'm not going to cut your food for you.
I guess we just see things differently.
So how long have you been coming to this little osteria?
If we get married will you cook the meals?
I think this nutrition obsession has gone to your head.
You're just talking in circles at this point.
Which setting is your favorite?
First you say you want to whisk me away to paradise, then you tell me to beat it? You do realize you’re giving me mixed messages, right?!
You have my head spinning," doesn't sound like much of a compliment coming from you
I know you like Pina Coladas, but do you have half a brain?
We should have met for smoothies.
Mansplaining again? Really?
You know it still counts as meat.
Wow, you’re a real smoothie talker.
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Do you need me to cut your food for you?
I had mixed emotions about this blind date.
So sorry that your potatoes are touching your carrots. It all ends up in the same place, dear.
And yes, I do want you to meet my parents, and you should meet my parents...but...
Omg, I love juicing too!
Do you have to be so loud?
Everything ok on your blend, honey?
Yeah my head was spinning too when I heard about the divorce!
Which pulse would you like me to check?
You know, you never seem to blend in.
The prices these days just make your head spin!
Sometimes, I feel like we don’t talk anymore.
You’re mixing me up with another girl.
Your profile pic was, uh, different.
You seem distracted tonight, darling.
After a 3 month period of dating Mr. Easy going, Daisy has a formal introduction to Mr. Always Agitated!
Say when.
A cocktail? No, I'll just have a protein shake.
You thought we were just having drinks?
Everything seems so mixed up lately.
Just stay quiet and we’ll blend right in.
It seems like you're a little shaken up over this.
You are waring thin!
There’s somebody else. And I’m leaving before you eat that hamburger.
I just don't think blended families work
Not sure this 'blended' family thing is going to work.
We need to slow down - I’m just not ready for purée.
Can we talk about something else? I’m getting tired of you rattling on about your juice cleansing diet.
Agreed... our waiter's tie is very obnoxious
If you weren't so good under the covers I'd have moved on long ago.
That must be waring you down.
so your Tinder profile says you were a deadhead in the 1970s
I can't have a conversation with you when you are spinning out like this.
I used to be 400 pounds
I had no idea they were still using straws here, or I would have booked somewhere else.
I think you have taken the idea of having a blended family to an extreme.
Slow down, George. You're making MY head spin.
You make my head spin
Is it a Game of Thrones thing?
You know, straws are, like, really bad for the environment
I used to have a toaster but I wanted to blend in.
I normally don't do blind dates, but I thought I'd mix it up.
Is this table too close to the kitchen?
Fred, I told you the silverware is not the best way to get your iron.
It’s me, not you.
Trying to blend as many speed dates as I can in one evening.
So this is what it means when you go to a “mixer?
You seem a bit shaken, not stirred.
Really?  You've never heard of Fred Waring and The Pennsylvanians?
I'm sorry but this isn't quite what I expected when your profile said that you came from a blended family.
You’re such a smoothie operator!
Sure, smoothies are great, but not for every meal.
A penny for your thoughts.
I, erm, don’t kiss on first dates.
Wow who did your makeup?
Look, I know it's a lot to take in-I can see your thoughts going a million miles an hour...
Oh, and you blend?
Could you not?
If you say you are feeling Im-PULSE-ive one more time I'm leaving.
Try to cut the spin
Really, if all you're going to do is CHOP and PULSE then I don't see any reason why we should continue this relationship.
Well, now that you mention it, yes, I do think meeting for an ice breaker might not be such a good idea after all .
You seem mixed-up.
You're right, the cost of smoothies in this place really does make your head spin.
I don't think we can make a blended family work.
I knew you should have ordered a smoothie.
You look a little different from your profile picture...
Sorry, I can't control when it turns on.
You seem to be mixed up.
Why does every dinner have to end with 'Let's make a Smoothie?'
I'm not asking for a lot, I'm just saying let's mix it up.
Yes, I said my head was spinning but why do you always try to one-up me?
If this is your idea of blending in, maybe you should go back to showing off.
You’re giving me some very mixed signals right now.
I just wish you wouldn't give me such mixed signals.
Well, I mean, who among us isn’t mixed up in the head?
I’m sorry. You’re right. It was insensitive of me to ask if you come from a blended family when we’re at the faculty mixer.
I thought you said to mix things up for date night.
Forget your games. You got something to say, spit it out.
I'm just a robot trying to blend in.
I hate it when you blend with your mouth open.
It's just that I feel that you're all mixed up...
Oster, darling, I was hoping we could mix things up a bit.
Shaken, not stirred ????
Would you like some juice?
So, your profile says you're good with your hands?
When you said you were from Shaker Heights...
Don’t be so fussy. Just give it a whirl.
I've been dating since my ex put HIS head in an oven.
I love you, but I'm not ready to blend our families.
Whining about everything isn't helping.
My father was a Cuisinart, his father was a Cuisinart, and I am a Cuisinart. And you will follow the rules of this family.
What's keeping those Daiquiris?
Your profile said you were taller.
It’s great being a blended family
Winfred, I worry about our relationship, sometimes you get things all mixed up.
God Harold, what are you Waring?  That's not what I meant about looking forward to a blended family.
My ex wasn't good around the house, but I bet you could come in handy.
Well, the dating app said to look for a guy wearing a Waring.
I don’t know what the problem is...you blend right in.
Couldn’t you just ORDER a tossed salad, dear?
OH... I'M SORRY ... THERE HAS BEEN A MIX UP
But your profile said you were a NutriBullet
So, how do YOU feel about a blended family?
When your match.com profile said you like to make yourself useful, I didn't think that you meant it in a literal sense.
This conversation is just going in circles.
Why yes, I think my diet is giving me food hallucinations.
I find your thinking isn't just scrambled, it's pureed.
There's no need to worry, honey, blendered families are very common nowadays.
I was drawn to you because I really want a blended family...
Well, puree for you.
Should I get you a straw?
Please do not do your Linda Blair impersonation at the table.
I expected you to take my pregnancy better than this.
I don't usually share this on a first date but if you must know, I have sensitive teeth.
Is it me or is the room spinning.
I know you’re mixed up, but I think you will be happier with me than with Ann.
I’m not feeling well, my heads been spinning all day
That's not what I meant by "let's brainstorm".
She had every right to laugh when you asked about the soup.
I told you to stop flicking back and forth between Fox and CNN for hours on end.
It's not what I meant when I said "Let's blend in".
Well Mr. smoothy, you picked this place.
I feel our relationship is stuck on ‘purée’.”
We need to talk about your drinking problem.
Well, it's a mixed feeling!
I'm just looking for that one woman I want to blend the rest of my life with.
Dear, why do you keep mixing up everything I say?
George, you have to stop reading the news so much.
A date with Mr Smooth
Please, Ed, don't stir up any more trouble with the waiter.
Just eat your dinner.
I thought Monica said "blind" date.
Where I come from it's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
I've always been attracted to men of mixed race.
I thought I was on Tinder, not Blender!
If I was a blind date Charles, it wouldn’t be a problem.
Next time, treat the waiter with a bit more respect.
I've felt in a whirl for this whole relationship.
My friends said I should mix things up, so here we are.
I know your head's been in a whirl since we met, but I can't accept your proposal. I just don't want a blended family.
Sorry, just the Adderal kicking in.
When I go to social mixer, I always hope to meet someone from a blended family.
I must say, you don't look like your pictures...
The product of a blended family.
It serves you right for calling the waiter a pot head.
How do you manage to clear your mind?
What do mean it goes to 11?
So, this is your solution to "make everything a smoothie?"
My therapist said I need to mix it up in my personal life.
I am Smoothieman
Whir are we headed?
You’re almost the perfect blend.
I don't care how many times your mother told you to chew each bite of food!  Seven times is more than enough.
You’re too much of a smoothie-operator for me,
I could really go for a martini
I’m not sure I am ready for a blended relationship.
I’m not judging, all I’m saying is that in you’re profile picture the blender was a more modern version.
Your lack of a pulse leaves me feeling crushed.
Well my lips are sealed. Looks like yours are too
This is not what I meant when I said we need to shake things up on our marriage!
So you’re your from a blended family.
So you're a smooth talker who likes to mix things up!
I thought we could finish our meal before we have cocktails.
No thank you my steak is not too chewy
I do love you, it’s just all the stigma of being in a vita mixed race relationship is getting to me. “
Your online profile did say you were from a blended family.
I think we need to talk about your new dentist.
He blends in very well
If you think  waring  a blender is cool, try a Cuisinart.
Believe me! This beats a Vacuum
You really were born to frappe.
Politics makes my head spin.
I don't think your psychiatrist meant 'blend in' literally.
Real smooth....
Not quite what  I  meant on Tinder when I wanted a blended family.
I don't know who I am any more.
Um... you looked a little different in your profile picture.
Oh, so that's what you meant when you said you like to mix it up!
"Well, I had always hoped to have a blended family...
Having mixed thoughts again!!
So you said you know the chef?
Sorry. I should not have assumed you wanted a daiquiri.
yes, more and more Kafkaesque.
My nutritionist didn't trust me to chew my food properly.
Even weirder is that the waiter understood his order.
Frank, your smoothie mode wore off a long time ago.
I don’t think we blend very well.
I know you said you liked to blend in... but this is ridiculous!
When you said you wanted to be a Ninja,  I guess I had something else in mind.
The ad said you like to stir the pot.
I suggest starting with meditation,
I thought when you said I turned your head you were referring to my looks . . .
Yes, Darling, you blend.
You say our relationship is mixed up, but I think it's you.
Why yes, I do come from a blended family. Why do you ask?
We don't blend well in public.
Have you seen my cap? Otherwise, this will be a mess.
Sure, I do smoothies, but milkshakes are my passion.
The Blendr profile question about "speed settings" makes a lot more sense now.
I see you are a shaken, not stirred sort of guy.
I know. Dating these days really  makes your head spin.
If you'd told me you were eating only soft foods, we could have gone somewhere else.
All the Spring vegetable options must make your head spin.
But where is this going?
I don't like what this juice diet is doing to you.
No, Why would I think you were from a blended family?
I think you're mixing things again.
This is not what I meant when I said I wanted a blended family
Honey, if you must puree your food 32 times, please do it quietly!"
Mixed up, yes ... but not in that way.
And I thought Rick's chewing sounded gross.
You should have tipped better last time.
You've got my head spinning.
Brian, what kind of name is Blenderhead?
Well, I have to be honest.  You were more attractive before you went gluten-free, vegan, raw, and juicing.
Could you blend a little quieter? People are starting to notice..
For once could you please just chew your food slowly?
My last husband  wasn’t battery operated and we just couldn’t go anywhere.
That's quite a juicer you have on your shoulders, Ted.
How many speeds does your cock have?
I'm sorry, my mind is ablur.
You're trying to hard to blend in.
I don't think that's what your doctor meant  by a liquid diet.
I know I don't look like the profile picture, but give me a chance.
You can spin it any way you want, but this meal is simply awful.
If I wanted a Smoothie I'd order one.
I agree it's faster than chewing, but does everything always have to be puréed?
When you are on your first date and he says, “I’m not like the other guys.”
Yes, I have a blended family.
They will serve everything puréed, upon request.
I can always tell when you've got crushing news.
You should have been more polite to our waitress.
That is not what he means by shaken not stirred !!
Are you listening to me?
You have kids? David, my profile said I'm not interested in a blended family.
When I said I wanted to 'shake things up in our dating life' this isn't exactly what I meant"
Tonight is going to be rough
Look darling, we all get
mixed up.
No,it's not you,it's ME who's mixed up.
You could at least offer to clean 
your blades first.
well at least you are chewing your food properly
You’re mixed up. And don’t you dare try to spin me.
I hear you're a real smoothie talker
Daiquiri?
I merely had asked if you were a good mixer...
Not everything has to be a smoothie, Howard.
Jeremy, granted you are mixed up; but, you are not a blender.
I thought I'd miss it, but I don't at all.
I can’t hear you.
It comes with two other attachment styles.
I certainly think a restaurant critic should know this isn't what your editor means when she says "Just blend in," Ernest.
Mr. Hamilton, I asked you to STOP not CHOP.
You're thinking of my brother. I'm *Keith* Servo.
How long have you been on this smoothie diet?
I can't handle this anymore. You're just too mixed up.
I'm so sorry, but matter how hard you try, we just don't blend together that well.
I said I wanted a date that was well balance, not blended.
Stop being so dramatic.  I know talking about our renovation budget always makes your
 head spin.
"On that website where we met, you said you 
wanted to meet someone with whom you 'could blend in.' "
I love meeting guys at a mixer.
I guess I just felt like being the top sales rep for blenders wasn't enough.
I thought of going on dates from  Blendr but not quite literally!!
I can't shake this feeling that you want to break up with me..
That’s not what I meant by “enjoying mixers”.
Shaken, not stirred.
Do you have to purée everything?
I'm sorry I ordered the smoothie.
I'm sorry I tend to mix up conversations.
I dont think that's what they mean by a blended family.
I'm sorry I said you weren't much of a blender.
I know your not sure of yourself in this place but couldn't you just try to blend in.
It was a blended marriage, you say?
I think you're taking the liquid diet thing a little too far.
You do seem rather mixed up
Perhaps we should try the pulse setting when we get home?
It might help you digest but it makes me queasy.
At home? I mostly just make smoothies.
You’re getting yourself all worked up again, dear. I don’t think you want to blow your lid again.
I also grew up in a blended family.
Let’s not mix things up
Does your pulse button work?
Your head must be spinning from all of those before dinner pina coladas.
Did you leave the oven on?!
I am not trying to give you mixed signals, but you have my head spinning!
What do you mean by a pulse check?
I know some guys don’t like to go down on women and they have weird excuses that barely veil machismo brought on by the patriarchy, but I have a legit good reason.
You said you’d found an alternative to conventional dentures???
It’s now all very apparent why you are always so mixed up.
We just needed to mix things up!
My dog can do that four times a second and also wag his tail.
You're a real smoothie!
What?  You are the one that suggested that we mix it up!
Wastin' away in where now, Jimmy?
Live it up, Jerry. The plastic straw ban starts tomorrow.
My doctor said I should chew my food 30 times before I swallow.
No, in fact I’m never eating again.
Don't you like to chew?
Would you please stop spinning your story?
Your dating profile didn't mention that you were in kitchen appliances.
You are taking market liquidity too far dear...
For once, will you concentrate on what is in front of you.
Are you shaking your head no?
Apologies, I’m on the liquid diet.
I could have sworn my friend had said “blind date,” but I guess it beats a bland date.
Don’t overthink it, you are all mixed up
When I read "a great mix of talents," I wasn't expecting this.
My ex and I were always on the rocks.
Funny, you don’t look juicer-ish.
I am very happy with our blended family.
Thanks for the proposal, but I'd rather not have a blended family.
Harold, I know you want to blend in, but stop it!
You're mixing my words.
Excuse me ..do you need a spoon?
Try and not squeak too much while your eating!
Do you want to hear something funny?
I am definitely mixed up.
With your kids and mine we'll have a blended family.
I know it comes as a shock, but let's be honest, Lou. Your head is always spinning.
You don’t look anything like the picture you posted on Match!
I can see what you think about whirled peas.
So Blenderhead , how long have you been on Match?
I just love the fact that this place is a BYO Blender.
You’re more than just a silly crush
Douglas, I understand you puree but honestly how does that help us in bed?
Well, I found it fascinating when I read your profile, and it said you were the head of ninjas.
Gee Bob, I may not be ready for a blended family.
No thanks i'll use my flatware...
Do we have to have a blended family?
No problem. I'm a big believer in mixed marriage.
Your picture showed a rotary mixer. I wasn't expecting to move quite this fast.
Would you say grace?
When you said you were always mixing things up, I  never imagined it was true!
I get it. You're trying to tell me something is Waring on you.
So, you really are keeping your no solid foods Lenten discipline.
You could have just ordered a smoothie.
I need my own identity. I’m tired of being “Mrs. Coffee.
Do I look like I am blending in with the crowd?
Is this a new spin on BYO?
Don't you ever get sick of eating at fusion restaurants?
Well, you don't have to get all liquefied about it.
Multitasking, are we?
Sorry I’m late. I got a little mixed up.
You really make a big deal of being part of a blended family."
I'm leaving you, Steve. We don't frappe anymore.
Could you please take it off during supper?
Have you considered dentures?
Do you have to do this now?
Percolate all you want,I need a solid commitment
...so when were your Tinder pictures taken, anyway?
I'm not sure I'm ready to blend our  two families together.
What's wrong, honey?
... and then all of his victims were pureed. I'm scared, Mr Waring. I hope they catch him soon!
I thought this would be a mixer.
I know. I know.  I DO chew my food.
Honey, I'm sorry, but I think you are all mixed up!
Frankly, I feel like I'm getting mixed signals from you,Harold.
She left me for a Bacardi.
Sorry, I'm not sure how I feel about being a part of a blended family
When I said I wanted a blended family I didn't mean it literally!
I just love the idea of a blended family.
This isn’t quite what I expected when I decided to give online dating a whirl.
Honey, I think your vertigo is acting up again
Right now I'm just going to take your word for it, that kissing you is a mind- blending experience
First dates never go smoothly for me, so I thought I’d try a Vitamix.
Are you okay? I feel like your head is spinning.
You're always mixing up what I say!
You are at a 'puree' right now and I need you to be at a 'blend.'
Just because you didn’t remember to wear a necktie didn’t warrant the matre d’s over reaction.
You are perfect. I always wanted a blended family.
Are we going to talk at all this evening or are you just going to keep shaking your head?
Shaking things up again?
Well, you’re profile did mention that you are from a blended family but...oh, never mind.
My ex-wife said I was good for lifting heavy stuff, fixing the car and making a wicked  frozen margarita .
Your plate or mine?
OK, that's better.  Now I think you're ready to be a Cabinet Secretary.
The Doctor said  all you need to do is chew your food 20 times....
You invented a Gender Blender?  I'm very impressed. I'm also very out of here.
How’s your vertigo, honey?
I wish you had just given the digestive enzymes a chance.
kind of mixed up?
Digestive issues?
Should we just skip the dinner?
I can handle your daily grind but not these mixed signals.
That's always your response.
Could you shut up for just a moment? I'm trying to say something.
How are the daiquiris here?
You’ve got to stop slicing and dicing my every thought.
No, I don’t want my dinner puréed
Darling, you make my head spin too.
Blending our families should be easy.
You are always spinning the facts to suit your narrative!
Ever since my wife left me I’ve just been a bit mixed up.
So how long have you been a Ninja?
So Mister Mince Puree, what is it that you do?
Is the blended family more than you can handle?
OK. Let's have Robert's sense of humor, Jason's lovemaking and Ken's intellect.
Thank you for the dinner. You have saved me from my daily grind.
‘You must be mixed up. I’m Susie’
You look all shook up! Are you OK??
I'm not sure that seminar on how to become a mixer was really worth it, Jerry
You are nothing but a sweet talking smoothie!
I hate it when my food touches, too.
I was actually seeking a 'pure' relationship, but perhaps autocorrect is a matchmaker...
Perhaps you might be carrying the juicing trend to extremes?
Mr. President, I do think this new approach has yielded progress in keeping your messages consistent.
I wouldn't do that for just a $5,000 NEA grant,
I said let's try to BLEND in.
Do not expect to get a kiss of any kind tonight
Oh, now I understand what you meant in you bio, when you said you came from a blended family.
Try to blend in a little, honey.
First dates all start to sound the same after a while.
I don't believe you, you're too smooth.
Somehow I don’t think it’ll be a good alternative to dentures.
You’re beginning to sound like my Moulinex
I hear that you’re a third-generation chef.
I get that you love smoothies, but don't you think the surgery was a bit over the top?
If you wanted a smoothie, why didn't you say so?
‘’I think your dentures were a better look,Harry.’’
Stop reading the news. It's making you agitated.
Sorry, I thought I was told this would be a blind date.
Wouldn’t it have been better to simply get new dentures?
So, you say you're having a whirlwind romance?
I understand why you call yourself a smoothie operator
I don't  think you blend in
You'll be marrying into a blended family Babs.
I feel like my days are all blending together?
Stop being so melodramatic
It’s a simple process, Carl.
I think you’re taking your smoothie regimen a bit far.
You look nothing like your Tinder pics.
This is obviously not your first dating mixer.
The caffeine will do it to you every time.
You need to focus.
College mixers are always strange but this takes the cake.
So how long have you been on the Blender app?
That last glass of wine has my head spinning
I asked for fine dining. You mix up everything.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a ninja.
Are you sticking with the hybrid or going all electric?
But your Tinder profile said you were searching for someone to share a blended family with!
'Let me break this down for you...'
Lose your dentures again?
I can tell  you are still shook up over the idea of a blender family.
I hear you loud and clear, Ben. But I do think it's an on-off relationship.
So, did you develop this diet on your own?
I like it shaken not stirred.
It's not the order that got mixed up.
After my last cheating boyfriend, I treasure your transparency.
No offense, but when you start talking about tax law, it all sounds like gobbledy-gook to me.
I just feel like our conversations always end up going in circles.”
Well, atleast the drinks are on him...
Yes, yes, you like your cocktail fresh...but there are limits.
Are you sure you read the liquid diet instructions correctly?
Was it the dress that did it for you?
And here I thought Blendr might be a little safer!
So, how do you blend in?
So you're okay with a blended family?
I'm sorry, this isn't going to work out. I prefer solid foods.
Um, sir, this is kind of awkward to say on our first date but...you seem to have a blender as a head.
Are you sure you’re not from a blended family?
Is this what you meant by a blended family?
You sure you're not taking your health kick too far?
Are you going to make that whirring sound even while we eat?
This is definitely not the impression I got from your profile.
Make mine a double.
I hope I'm not Waring on you ?
Can you tell how much I'd like a Margarita right now?
Television makes blended families look much more appealing.
I just don't get why you'll let strangers make your milkshakes, but not me?
Why must you blend, grind, stir, mix, or puree everything I say?
Ummm, you didn't mention this in your profile.
Smooth.
I should have ordered the bass-o-matic.
This might be the smoothie talking but I actually liked Green Book.
Mary did say you were a smooth talker.
I'm not looking to blend in.
Yes, I realize you are not technically chewing with your mouth open, but...
I don't think our blind date was a good blend.
I love how things are going, but I'm just not ready to 'liquefy' yet.
Not everyone can wear a blender, but you can pull it off.
Your always spinning things.
Well, I did tell you that we should mix things up more often.
Anything wrong with the rest of the meal?
But your profile said you could purée!
So, what do you do for a living?
I thought when you responded to my match.com profile saying that I put your head in a spin you were speaking metaphorically.  Now I dare say we both are all mixed up.
This isn’t going to work, i’m Sorry. Our personalities just don’t blend.
Why are you Waring that?
Your family named you Oster...?  I think it’s lovely...  could you now refill my drink.
Whirr did you say you were from again?
I'm not going to mince words--this relationship is OVER.
That's your problem: your mind is always awhirl.
Why am I hearing buzzing in my ear?
All I asked you for was a commitment.
What did I say Frank? 
Don't inspect the kitchen.
I've honestly never dated someone from Blendr before
When I saw your  profile I never would have guessed you were such a smoothie.
Harold, I’ve asked you not to blend in public!
You might be a bit mixed up, but I find your mind delicious.
I’ve never been to this kind of mixer before.
When I said I wanted to mix things up in our sex life, I didn't think you would take it so hard.
Can you just listen to my thoughts and not try to synthesize them?
I've been in and out of refurbishment
Chew your food, don't blend it
Don't shake your head at me like that; I've always liked meat.
Oh my, do I get your head spinning
All those nights blend together for me too.
The blender saves on chewing.
I know your profile said you blended into most social settings, but this isn't what I expected.
No, I'm sorry.  I won't marry you.  My mother warned me about blended families.
I read on your profile that you come from a blended family. Would you like to tell me about it?
Sorry, I'm not ready for a blended family.
At least I don't have to pre-chew your food for you any more.
It seems rather an extreme way to tell me we will be a blended family!
Tonight has been a whirlwind!
The dating service indicated you would be a smoothy.
So when your Match.Com profile said your nickname was Smoothie I thought it referred to your personality.
Maybe I don't want to shake things up...
You said we need to start mixing things up!
Will you be making the Margarita's?
My friend never mentioned that you were in finance.
Uh...this isn't exactly what I meant about a blended family...
That isn't what I meant by 'blending in better.'
So much for trying a computer dating service.
Yes, I know my reply to your personal ad indicated that I was open to a blended family, but...
I guess we could mix things up.
I believe that you are just an ole smoothie.
Dear, I think you've taken this liquid diet thing too far

not blend-master!

My day was a grind too, but can we at least talk about something else?
I’m sorry, but my yenta told me you were a ninja.
Your mastication is premature."
Your profile did say you were a ninja

You could of just said no to dinner with me.
I thought you said stirred, not shaken
Is it really necessary to get puréed about it?
Yes, I love a man with a grate head on his shoulders.
How long do you need to be on a pureed diet?

Cmon you know I’m an electritarian.
I think you may need some help. You seem all mixed up in the head or something.

The chef will be very offended if you do.
You mixed up the drinks, didn't you?
So you like Piña Coladas, huh?

I still don't see why we couldn't just go for smoothies...
Sorry, but no, you don't blend in.
What to you mean "temporary partials?"
I think you're really mixed up.
Where’s the plug!?

I am sorry I called you a blender head...it was just the first thing that came to my mind
He seems different from the photos...
You're sending me blended messages.
Wearing blender?
So... when I asked if you like to mix things up, this isn't really what I had in mind.
Food for Thought
Honey, you're taking our blended family thing a little too far.
Did you get all mixed up again, my dear?
Be quiet honey. You'll never blend in making that racket.
It's just...this relationship is turning into a recipe for disaster.
I feel you're trying to drown me out.
I know...the waiter has no pants on. Now, eat your burger.
I love that we're both from blended families.
You seriously have to switch to de-cafe!
I know,I know,chew your liquids and drink your solids.
I can tell that listening to my life story is making your head spin.
So... I'm guessing you'll be eating the salad as kale juice?

Does Blenderism run in your family?
Funny, you never mentioned on Tinder that you had special dietary needs!
Honey, your speech is all mushy
They Warned me that you were a rea Smoothie !
Well, then order something else to mutilate.
I just can’t be with a man who could frappe.
You’re the Genie. Is this what you meant when you said let’s mix things up???

This is your brain on blender.
Can you make anything else besides a shredded 'head of lettuce' ?
You say it does not change the taste, just helps with digestion?
I think you're taking mastication a bit too far
The noise when you make your own smoothie makes it difficult to hold a conversation.
I understand...since your teeth work...
Remember what the salesmen said, just toss your food in there and it will go down nice and smooth.

I come from a blended family also...

A kiwi fruit for your thoughts, Jeffrey.
Dear, the work day is over. You can turn your brain purée off now.

They said I needed the receipt

You are a man of deep ... frappéd ... thoughts.
Now I see why you said over the phone your head is spinning way above average!

We'll have to skip dessert. I'm running out of juice
When you said you'd stir things up ummm...
Sorry. We don't have to talk about Clara.  I  can see your head 's in a different place.
I shouldn't talk about my mother on a first date, but that might explain some things.
Ralph, I resent that, I'm not mixed up about it, and I think they call that projection.
You're so smoothie​.
can you fucking close your mouth when you chew your food you god damn slob
This was not what I had in mind when I said I would be interested in a blended family
What do you say, wanna shake things up?

Your looks is fine but the noise is causing attention.

I think we shall pass on utensils today.
Apparently, you broke it to her.
Please don’t get all crushed ice with me, honey.
Is that a Ninja?
You got my order all mixed up.
This can't be good.
Dear, don't get so upset when the president calls you "cocktail head."
On match.com you said you like to 'Shake 'n Bake, I guess I didn't understand.
Good effort, honey, but now we’re just attracting more attention.”
You're all mixed up now, Honey. Let me explain it again.
My mother would always tell me to chew my food, guess it depends on where you grow up..?
Isn't it juicy enough for you?
Trevor darling you take things too literally sometimes. When I said your looks were such, that you should try to blend in at this restaurant, I meant for you to control some of your extreme behaviours!!
That shake-up at the office really seems to have gotten to you.
Stop trying to smoothie over the problem.
''It's not you, it's pea.  I hate pea protein."

I've been trying to mix things up. What do you think?
I agree it's a way to express your disdain for fusion food and disguise your identity as a restaurant critic.
I know this has you all shook up, but try to see it from my perspective.
You are as fresh as they come.
Have you seen the blender?
Really dear, I do wish you would comb your hair like a normal person.

I prefer a cocktail over a smoothie.
My date sounds like the current administration.  He continuesly spins tales.
Excuse me whilst I purée your love/hate feelings into an Acceptable Joe Bisque.

I absolutely LOVE coffee. How did you know?
I appreciate the song choice, but I didn't need proof that I "spin you right round"...
You shouldn't have asked the chef to blend your food.
You're sure you don't want a hamburger and fries smoothie?
I'm getting mixed emotions from you about this restaurant.
Is this your idea of a joke?
A mixer, four speed dating.
Why did you ask me out if you only identify with kitchen appliances?
Honey, I know you are overwhelmed and mixed up, but this is ridiculous!!
Blenderhead Man,make me a Pina Colada
I'm flattered that you are, but I'm not.
I'm pretty sure Fletcherizing means you do you own chewing.
Dieting is fine, sister, but don't let it go to your head.

The brand doesn’t matter to me as long as we can blend in.

Having everything in common is a turn off in some cases

I'm sorry, I know you are a Ninja Professional NJ600, but I've upgraded to a Nutribullet.
... there’s just something about these ‘processed’ foods
Burger and fries?

You need to get past your ex and her veganism
AGHAGHAGHAGHAGH!
Well I think you should give yourself more credit for eating out in public and trying to blend in Aunt Ellen.

No, I'd rather not drink my food.
I think you are mixing your emotions with rumors
Are you going to get out of that spacesuit or do you intend to hide behind it during the entire dinner? I don’t like people hiding behind a mask, you remind me too much of Jim Carey!
Does it really look just like a Telefunken U-47?
I can see your head is spinning now.  Let me back up to the pig’s blood incident.

My parents never kissed me as a baby.
Telling me that you're gonna get my food wet is NOT hot.
The food here is already healthy.  It doesn't have to be pureed.
Sorry, I sometimes get names mized up.
Some are addicted to cell phones; Others coffee
We're different people, Mister Pupkin. I need my space and you're stuck on liquify.
I hope you don’t think you’re going to score.
Even though we blend fruity notes smoothlie on a speed date, I fear we'd achieve a dissonant, divorçaic aftertaste, rather than a harmonious, wedding-cake finish.
To be honest, I prefer Miami Beach
It's less fuss than bringing my husband along to cut up my food.
You always have the most profound and inspiring things to say.

Let me whip up a quick mango smoothie, I am Veggie after all

I see where you got the nickname "Vege-head!
My parents found out when I was twelve, it turns out the kitchens at Harvard are really low on culinary equipment.
So you want to take a different spin on our relationship, huh?

My. You grind, er chew, your food intovery fine bits.
Everything isn’t bassomatic.
I like it if it is secular.
You were at my wedding, Denise...
Don't be so literal. I said, "shake it till you make it" through this date.
I’ll be upset if you eat too fast.
Please don’t blow your top about the dress-code.
But I did not order a Grande milkshake...
There has to be more to our relationship, than a good cup of coffee.
Honey, I’m just trying the smoothie.
I now realize the irony of using 'blend-harmony'
Are you still self conscious of using public restrooms after you bought me a waffle iron for my birthday last year?
Will you do anything to enable using a straw?
Please don’t take it like that, but I think this computer dating is not for me.”
I don't get why everyone says blend dates are weird

So Blender, what is your superpower?  I homogenize evil-doers.
I appreciate your attempt at solidarity, but #MeToo is so much more than a redefinition of the Smoothie.
OK, yes—I did swipe right, and then swiped right again, but I don't see what that has to do with it.
Girl: “The CBD in the burger, the shake and everything else will already do that for you; no need to mash it more”

Well, you said you wanted a fool-proof diet plan.
Don’t make that face at me, it’s a major turn-off”

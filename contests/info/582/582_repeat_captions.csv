I think I'm being followed.
Don't turn!
How's the weather back there?
Turn right at the corner
Follow me.
"What time is it where you are?
Bump.
Sharp curve ahead!
Can you hear me now?
Stop following me.
I can still smell you.
TELECOMMUTING
This long distance relationship is working out.
Race you to the finish line.
You seem distant.
Hey, now I'm a bike dork with extra torque!
Rock.
Pothole in 10 seconds.
Are we there yet?
Try to keep up.
What?
How's it goin back there?
Honey, wait up!
You said you wanted to go for a long bike ride.
Let me know when you get here.
I think we should see other people
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Slow down!
My lawyer said a separation would have it's ups and downs.
We've agreed to a trial separation.
I feel we're growing apart.
No, I didn't just fart!
Can you smell me now?
Can you hear me?
You seem distant lately.
This isn't what I meant by "long bike ride."
No, we're not there yet!
On your left.
I'm losing you.
I don't know. Where do YOU want to eat?
I am on my bike, I'll call you later
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do.
Text me when you get there.
Curve!
Did you get my text?
I'm not sure if I really like this "long distance" relationship"
So how's the weather?
Long distance calls
Are you pedaling?
I'm starting to feel a distance between us.
I told you never to call me here.
We used to be so close.
Is this what you meant by a long bike ride?
Just text me
I'll be in Scotland a'fore ye.
Winter is coming.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I needed space.
Pick up the pace. You're falling behind.
Nope. I can still smell the beans.
This long distance relationship isn't working out for me.
You missed the turn!
Turn left!!!
I'll text you when I get there.
Do these shorts make my butt look big?
These roaming charges are killing me.
Pedal faster.
I'm almost there.
Right turn coming up.
No backseat driving.
Your butt crack is showing.
This trial separation isn't working.
Yes, I'll accept a long-distance call.
Daisy? Is that you?
Call when you get there.
We're doing a trail separation
Long distance relationship.
I thought you said you enjoyed long bike rides.
I think I can make the light.
But your profile said you like long bike rides.
Wanna race?
You're breaking up
Miss you, too!
I miss you.
Pedal faster. You're falling behind.
I'll call you when I get home.
Does this count as a long-distance call?
Hello, which way are we turning?
I think we have a bad connection.
Wait up!
I can still smell your gas
I want a divorce.
You've just been so distant lately.
Tight turn ahead
I feel like we're drifting apart.
Are we almost there?
I don't think this long distance riding is working out.
Call me when you get home
Daisy...Daisy...Can you hear me now?
Where are you?
Did you fart?
Catch Up.

You said you need some space in our relationship.
I need more space.

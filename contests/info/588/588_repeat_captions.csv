Not much, you?
I have a hunch.
I don’t know...His face doesn’t ring a bell.
I had a hunch he would be back!
He's asking if this is a sanctuary city.
The Blue Bells, The Blue Bells...
I’m not sure, but his face rings a bell.
He's Quasi cute...
He says his name is Quasimodo.
I don't know who he is but his face rings a bell.
On the other hand, he is French.
Call it a hunch.
That name rings a bell.
He gave me water
"I have a hunch he's back".
The Hunchback of Peeping Tom
I'm thirsty
When I asked him if he remembers how he got up there he said "nothing rings a bell".
Come here often?
Does the name Quasimoto ring a bell?
He keeps calling me 'Esmeralda.'
It's just a hunch.
I can't remember his name, but his face rings a bell.
Your hunch was right. He's back.
...just a hunch
I hate hump day.
Yes, he's really on the ball.
Hold on....someone is ringing the bell
Quasimodo is stalking me again.
It's a long story.
What hump?
They call me The Pervert of Notre-Dame.
I love you.
Parkour!
And it looks like he might be the one who stole my other plant.
I dunno but his face rings a bell.
I think he's a squatter.
Hello, Moto.
Nothing new here, how about you?
Hunchback of the Upper West Side
A leap of faith.
I'll always have Paris
I'd like to report a peeping Quasimodo.
He just doesn't ring my bell.
I had a hunch you'd be here.
I had a hunch he'd be back.
I'm calling to report a peeping Tom.
He's looking at me again.
I'd like to report a peeping gargoyle.
He can't tell if he is interested in me or just wants to hang out.
I have a hunch he'll be back.
Can you hear me now?
His face rings a bell
Fern whom the bell tolls.
Mouse!
The good news is he's stopped ringing the bell...
I don't know his name but his face rings a bell.

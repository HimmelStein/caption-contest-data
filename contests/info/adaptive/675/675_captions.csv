Let's let him keep your ball.
So, this is fine but you're scared of the vacuum cleaner?
Well, if you haven't pooped, I have.
It doesn't matter that you peed on it first, it's not your rock anymore.
So suddenly mister bark at everything has nothing to say.
Before the last election, this would have scared the bejeezus out of us, Quentin.
Maybe just let him keep your stick.
Maybe don't sniff this one.
You're totally thinking you could outrun me, aren't you?
This. This is why we don't chase down every smell.
Wag your tail so it doesn't feel threatened.
Kinda puts going to the vet in perspective, doesn't it?
That's what happens to dogs who drink from the toilet
Well just don't stand there. Ask yourself, 'what would Lassie do?'
There. That's what you've been barking at. Happy?
Now we’ve BOTH urinated. Let’s go home.
No, I think his bite is probably worse than his bark.
I don't care if she's in heat. No.
Are you serious?!  Thunder and the mailman but not this.
This seems like a good turn-around point.
'Let's go to the park,' I said. But, no, you had to go to the lagoon.
Sorry I didn't believe you about the mailman.
It's your turn to rescue me.
“Next full moon, we stay in the house and you can just pee on the rug, OK?”
Woof? That’s all you’ve got?
I know it’s your bone, but I’d let him keep it.
Emotional support dog, meet my anxiety.
I don't think he wants his butt sniffed.
See? That’s all it is. Can we PLEASE go back to bed now?
This walk was your idea.  You talk to him.
Just remember ... genetically you're 99% wolf.
Get a dog" she said, "It'll add years to your life" she said
Let's both roll over and play dead.
Well, this explains the puppies.
Well, if that doesn't scare it out of you, we might as well go home.
But you're scared of a vacuum cleaner.
I'm sorry I blamed you for those claw marks on the deck.
Still want to mark your territory?
I'm going to need a much bigger plastic bag
Well Fido, sometimes after you drain the swamp, something far worse takes over.
Yes, hard to believe that he was President from 2016-2020
You see it too, right?
I'll bet HE'S not afraid of the cat next door.
Satisfied?  This is what's been living under my bed since I was a kid.
Stay.  I'll be right back.
The patch of grass just outside the tent isn’t looking so bad now is it?
I suggested the dog park, but noooooo!
That's not a tree, so I'd keep my leg on the ground if I were you.
Don't sniff him.
Mind if I give him one of your treats?
Now might be a good time to show who is man's best friend.
The breeder said it’s a Labrademon.
But you'll bark at the mailman?
It's OK Rex, Mommy will feel better and come home after the election is over.
I'm afraid this time you're going to have to pick up after me."
I told you Max, you can't go by the profile pic.
After almost 3 years of Donald Trump as President, nothing is that frightening anymore.
He's why it's the path less traveled.
So you bark at the mail carrier, but this guy seems fine?
Obviously, he didn’t see what you did to that shoe...
It's ok. He's the President.
You know this guy? Tell me you know this guy.
Wait until you see his dog.
What was it when you buried it?
This is the part where you protect me
Well at least that explains what I picked up off the front yard this morning.
HON! HURRY UP AND TAKE THAT DAM PIC.
Uh, I think it's one of your demons. Mine all wear suits.
You're the seeing eye dog, what is it?
Probably not worth trying to get your bone back.
Woof?  Bit of an understatement wouldn't you say?
I bet if THIS guy told you to sit...
I'm sorry, Rufus. I just don't think he respects your urine-based territorial boundaries.
Let's just skip the part about confronting your worst fears and run like hell.
I guess we found where the wild things are.
He thinks you ate his MAGA hat.
Under the circumstances feel free to be as vicious as you’d like.
Try wagging your tail.
No, I don’t know Maurice Sendak.  Why do you ask?
Beg.
Let’s both play dead.
Oh, NOW you need to pee?
Well Lucky, what are we going to call you now?
You had to pee on the rock, didn’t you.
See, this is what happens when you drink from the toilet.
I'd let him sniff whatever he wants
Don't worry - I think those goofy artists at the New Yorker inserted us into the wrong cartoon.
This is where you bare your teeth and growl.
No, we’re not getting another one. You barely take care of the one we already have.
No way, too small for a purebred.  I'm guessing...were-doodle.
And guess what? They’ll vote him in too...
You could at least bark
I don’t care if she is in heat, the answer is no.
Heel, boy; nothing you haven't seen on Fox News already.
This is what we call an exception. Bark all you want.
Rex, kill.
We did say anyone else in 2020.
We're going to need at least one more poop bag.
You seriously didn't smell ANYTHING??
Look, when you signed up to be a therapy dog, I never promised it would be a walk in the park!
I know, I can't pee with someone watching me either.
He wouldn’t take his pill. That’s what happens when you won’t take your pill.
I'm sure he isn't allowed on the furniture either.
Your little schnauzer friend becomes quite 
the rascal at full moon time, doesn't he?
So now do you feel like pooping ?
Perfectly good dog park a block from home but noooo you wanted more excitement in your life .
You may have marked it as yours last week, but I'd let him have it.
This is why I get you vaccinated.
Don't you dare even think about sniffing his rear!
Before global warming swamp monsters never got this far north.
Relax boy, we've got him outnumbered.
If he tries to sniff your butt, LET HIM.
He looks like a bully. Remember, bullies are cowards.
You sniff his butt while I make a run for it.
Don’t worry boy. It’s just a metaphorical manifestation of the times we’re living in.
Let’s try the other dog park
No worries, Henry, let’s go to your second favorite tree!
...but the Roomba you're afraid of.
Not so tough now that you're not barking behind the window huh?
You keep him distracted...I’ll go for help.
I just marked my territory too."
A "Sorry I forced you to take my route today, Bob" might be appropriate about now.
Apparently, some dogs go to hell.
That 1% difference in DNA sure goes a long way.
G o ahead, tell me again about the time you scared a squirrel away.
You're saying this guy  stole your squeaky toy?
I'd skip the sniff.
Take him for a walk around Lake Diablo,' she says. 'It's so peaceful around Lake Diablo,' she says.
No, you ask him if he has your ball.
That could be you if you applied yourself.
I wouldn't try doing your leg thing
Technically he should be on a leash.
Now do you think selling your eternal soul for that bone was a good idea?
Retractable Leash, Giant Werewolf Repellent, Doggie Doo Bag:  which one do you think I forgot?
You got this.”
What are the chances it is a vegetarian?
What did we say about online dating?
I don’t care. We’re not leaving until you go.
I hate it when you act like you see things I don't.
You didn’t smell this coming?
Couldn’t  pee near the house, could you?  Had to go for a walk, didn’t you?
This is why I give you non-GMO dog food.
So this is where the wild things are...
I know it's your standard greeting, but I'd strongly advise against it.
Is this what you wanted to show me?
Now I need a poop bag.
Relax. He’s more afraid of you than you are of him.
Don't be silly. He's probably more afraid of you than you are of him.
You might want to rethink on-line dating....
We're not in Kansas anymore Toto.
That's why we got you from a licensed breeder.
Is this the bully at the dog park?
Still want the leash off?
I told you not to go on Ancestry.com, but you wanted to meet your relatives.
You promoted yourself as a rescue dog, so nows your big chance.
Just answer the damn riddle.
We don't need a gun my wife says. Get a dog; he'll protect us!
Do you have an extra poop bag?
All of the sudden you're nightly "howl-at-the-moon" routine doesn't seem so impressive, now does it?
What do you mean “were my best friend”?
The ball is the least of our worries.
How have you STILL not gone yet?
This is one of those times I really wish you could just go in the back yard.
Give him your low growl, Killer.
That's what you'll turn into if you keep eating the cat's poop!
See, this is why I don't use an online dating service.
How do you still not have to pee?
You bark at the TV, but this you're fine with?
Ya know, the cat never gets me in to these situations
Go for the throat!
There, we found what was making the noise. Can we go back inside now?
That does it. I’m calling the condo association.
The Doggie Monster eats bad little dogs that pee on carpets.”
I'd vote for him against Trump
Give him your nasty, long growl like when I keep you from licking my dinner plate.
Oh well.  Right now the real world is a lot scarier than anything this guy can dish out.
The FedEx guy knocks on the door, you're ready to tear his leg off, but Beelzebub on a rock ... not a peep.
After three years of Trump....this fool doesn't scare me at all.
He is not your father Luke
Let’s see those puppy-dog eyes get you out of this one.
It appears you were right, Ralph—this is an off-leash park.
Don't try to hump this one.
"He was downwind" is your excuse?
Why, yes, "troll" can be a noun.
And remember Sparky...
When you attack, go for the throat.
That rabies shot doesn't sound so bad anymore, does it?
Leave it. Leave it!
Stand up to a bully once and he'll never bother you again.
Don't worry, your new owner was thoroughly vetted by the Trump administration.
Relax, this is just what she looks like when she's hungry...you should see her when I forget to put the toilet seat down
You look more like your mother
This is serious.  Quit wagging your tail.
Remember, he just thinks he's president.
You keep him busy, boy. I'll run for help.
Kill Mr. Snuggles, Kill!
Lulu - kill!
You know she's out of your league, right?
You bark like a maniac at anyone wearing a hat. Now you got nothin?
All you can say is "woof"?
This. This is why we don't howl.
Finally, something worth barking at, but you’ve got nothing?
I’m going to need a bigger poop bag.
See what happens when you don't get your shots?
Just pretend it's the mailman.
I warned you he wouldn't look like his Tinder profile.
This is why we give Mum extra space every so often.
I thought you said Timmy fell down a well.
My hiccups just stopped!
We all have our demons.
It would help if  you stopped looking like lunch.
Oh, but if it were delivering our mail, then you’d go ballistic?
Now do you think the invisible fence is a good idea?
Hmm. That's why this side of the lake isn't crowded.
Your call.
This walk just became a run.
Still constipated?
Let’s let him keep the old tennis ball.
Don't buy a pit bull, she said.  They're too dangerous, she said.  Get a nice, gentle dog, she said.
I told you sometimes it's best to ignore those '23 and Me' connections.
So you bark at the mailman, but not this?
What if I told you he also delivers our mail?
OK, so where is barks-his-head-off at the mailman now, huh?
I told you that ancestry website was a bad idea.
What scares me is, who elected him President?
This is probably a good place to stop and head back.
Great. Uncle Fred has been to another Trump campaign rally.
Why did he say, ‘Luke, I am your father.’?
Sorry I blamed you for all those bones in the yard.
Dating profiles always lie.
What do you say we take a pass on the butt sniff this one time.
See what happens when you howl at the moon?
'Bark'? Mitzi, you're going to have to step up your game here.
No we can't keep him
... but you're afraid of the vacuum?"
Well, there are very fine people on both sides.
OK, so I've been wrong about you barking at nothing.
Well, now you know what you were barking at.
Remember, it's the size of the fight in the dog!
Alright, Fluffy - this is what you were trained for.
Just don't sniff his butt.
Oh good, you went.
I wish I brought more poop bags.
Its only Frank from down the street. Moonlight in Vermont affects each of us in its own unique way.
Unlike you, its bite is worse than its bark.
I'm sure it hides under the bed during a thunderstorm just like you.
No ,no .That's his tree .

.
Hey, you're the one who wanted to go to where the wild things are!
This is one of those times we talked about when it's OK to bark at someone.
So no reaction to this, but if the doorbell rings...
This will be the third tennis ball we lost today.
If you haven't pooped by now, I don't think it's happening.
So. I am to assume you barked " There's an animal from Hell" not "Timmy's fallen in the well"?
This would be a good time to demonstrate that powerful instinct to protect me that I’m always hearing about.
I'm thinking shepherd mix.
Now I know how you feel  about the vacuum cleaner.
Let's think of it as "fake news" Fido, and walk on.
OK, now I believe you.
I told you going for a walk on the night of a full moon was a bad idea.
What do you mean, "We canines stick together"?
What do you mean “give him my wallet”?
He drinks from the toilet
Your "play dead" days are about to come to an end.
I don't have to outrun him. I just have to outrun you.
He looks like a mixed breed.
You stay here, I'll go get help.
ok, now’s your chance to prove you’re my best friend
I hope you're seeing this too.
Do you STILL want to go where the wild things are?
Maybe we should try the dog park again.
Don't worry, old boy.It's called a Donald, and it's nothing but bluster.
Elections have consequences
Pretend it’s the cat.
Don’t worry, my dog’s really friendly!
You see that, right?
Try growling again.
It wasn’t a cat. Can we go back to bed?
Are you sure you want to be a guard dog?
I don't recommend sniffing his butt.
One last walk, you said.  It will help us sleep, you said.
Wow, her online profile didn't mention everything, did it?!
You can smell his butt from here.
Looks like we’ll both be playing dead.
Can you take him or should we run?
Another damn candidate for President!
If you're  going to pee, now would be the time.
He said he's a relative of yours. From the old country.
Can't even walk my dog at night without thinking of Donald Trump.
You dragged me ALL the way out here and now you don't have to go?
Sure, go ahead, sniff his butt
Let’s get a small dog, my wife said.  We don’t need a guard dog, my wife said.  We live in a safe area, my wife said. What can happen, my wife said....
But you'll howl at the delivery man.
No, this isn't a job for the cat!
It's your nightmare. You deal with it.
Either it’s the pot brownie talking, or were about to be edibles.
I think you could take him.
No, not a good time to bark.
For an emotional support dog, you sure are anxious.
Really? You still won't poop?
Duke, this is your father.
This is what you dragged me out here to see?
This is our new postman.
You got this, right?
You're right, the mailman is a monster.
Honestly, I think you should look for another spot
Okay, Beowulf.  Time for you to step up to the plate.
It’s the soul of chewed shoes.
Remember him?  He’s the instructor from dog obedience school.
That's OK boy, I just peed too.
Actually, it's your pal Milo. Quite the drama queen at full moon!
Wanna go for a run?
Please tell me your bite is actually bigger than your bark
You know, Fred... If this happened back before 2016, I would be surprised.
Don't you dare play dead.
I suppose "attack" is out of the question.
How fast can you imitate a Pit Bull?
Remember, go in low.
When it's not a full moon, he is really a poodle.
I knew Tinder for dogs was a bad idea.
Seriously? THAT's the puppy daddy?
Don’t stare, Rex, you’re making him feel uncomfortable.
If ever there was a time for you to bark your brains out, this is it.
You didn’t tell me your lady friend was such a looker.
We're getting a dog walker.
You know the drill: You smell his butt and then he gets to smell yours.
Well, it's no vacuum cleaner, but I think this is where you bark.
Go ahead, try and hump his leg.
All barked out, huh? Used them all up on the postman?
Aren’t you supposed to be barking or something?
So are you gonna go sniff his butt or what?
If this doesn't cure your constipation, I don't know what will.
Your turn to clean up after me.
The trail sign did say maximum difficulty.
Don't worry bud. We'll defeat him in 2020.
Well that’s just great. Another dog off leash. Why bother posting the sign if people aren’t going to take it seriously?
You're not the only one who has to pee.
And this is why canine Tinder is a bad idea.
See?  THIS is the kind of thing it's okay to bark at.
Try humping this one, Romeo.
Oh, but you'll bark at the neighbor's corgi?
Fine, I regret not believing you when you barked.
How am I the only one pooping right now?
No you cannot sniff his butt.
Sure, I would like to delete my internet history, message my loved ones and change my underwear...but here we are.
Just tell him that we are still considering his offer to buy Greenland
Just think of it as a real big squirrel.
That's what people food does to you.
Okay, maybe it IS the size of the dog in the fight.
What say we skip full-moon nights from now on, Champ?
I know we told Fluffy not to eat those mushrooms, but she is a cat and cats just don't listen.
See why vaccines are important.
Dare you to sniff his ass.
Oh. Now we don’t feel like barking our head off, do we?
Don’t be so judgmental, he’s a rescue.
It's bad enough Trump deforested the national parks.  Installing lifelike statues of himself where the trees had been is beyond the pale.
I thought you marked this as your territory.
This is why we have the fence.
Really, you still can't go?
Looks like the politicians have started their hometown visits.
You might need to pick up after me.
Well, it's not a tree, but it will have to do.
What is it boy, do you see something?
You couldn’t smell this coming a mile away?
Okay, you wanted to be the alpha. Go for it.
I think mom needs a Snickers bar
You're still the alpha dog at our house, Rex.
Remember, the walk was your idea.
Now you can beg.
You knew the risk of surprise before taking your DNA test.
Friend of yours?
Stay; he's full of fleas.
Relax, Duke. He's a vegan.
He was a good boy once. But he started refusing to sit or stay, then he ate the occasional shoe... I'm just sayin', Max.
Take a good look Spot, this is puberty.
Where's all the barking now?
I had always thought 'Where the Wild Things Are' was just more of my parents' bullshit
bark twice if you see him too
Can you growl please!
No, it's not a mirror
Great, now everybody has a weredoodle except me.
Let's look for your ball tomorrow after the catnip wears off.
You dragged me all the way out here just for this?
This is the last time I'm ever doing hallucinogens with you, Steve.
I'm sorry I blamed you for howling at the moon.
When you bit him, I thought he’d turn into something much more adorable.
Remember, Ralphie, when we meet someone new, we don't jump up or pee on their foot.
Now, don’t just play dead. Sell it.
Barking would be a good start.
We must be in a Red State "
Hopefully it will end with the 2021 inauguration.
Still think GMOs are harmless?
If this doesn't make you go potty, then we're headed back home.
If he's not a friend of yours, we better run.
Great, you sure did flush it out.  Now what?
See what happens when you eat your own poo?
What are we looking at? I forgot my glasses.
Go on Rex, tell him you want your stick back.
His name is fluffy and he won best of breed.
Cat got your tongue?
I'm going to need a bigger bag.
This is what you were barking at. 
Are you happy now?
Don’t judge. You were a rescue too.
Where is your incessant barking now?
Get out of the City for the summer, they said. The Catskills are great for your health, they said...
Don't worry, he's vegan.
Just remember, it's not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog.
This is the monster who comes for little doggies who don't stop peeing in their daddy's shoes.
Great. Now I have to pee too.
I don't see a thing.  Did you get into my edibles again?
I told you not to eat those mushrooms.
No he may NOT come over for a play date.
Just remember: it's the size of the fight in the dog.
Now we can both learn to play dead.
He's a mix, too.
See? I told you that wasn't Mrs. Miller's dog howling at the moon.
It's time to show me why you're called man's best friend.
Now I need to go to the bathroom
Like I’ve been telling you, this is what happens if you don’t wear your flea collar.
This is what happens when you drink from the toilet.
Chester, did you dig up this nice man's herb garden?
Should have chosen 'give the kids a bath'
This could only happen in a New Yorker cartoon.
She’s out of your league, Rex.
'Yip, yip, yip' all day long at the Rumba, but no 'heads up' on this?
You said you wanted to meet your birth mother.
I guess you can go off leash now....
see what happens when you lick yourself that way
Now you know why I take you to the groomer!
I told you the pot treats would not be good for you!
Now you decide not to bark?
No doubt his bite is bigger than your bark.
So while he’s frightening looking to me, he smells alright to you.
Repeat after me - woof, woof.
I see Frank is back on the Paleo diet.
That's the last time I let you follow a scent.
See, now there’s someone who knows how to guard the front door.
You can't outrun me if i don't drop the leash.
I'm thinking the ancestry search wasn't such a good idea.
You throw a fit over a squirrel across the street and now you got nothing.
I wanted a rottweiler, but OH NO I really want a beagle she says.
Twice in one walk?
I take it the whole alpha routine was pure theater?
You see? This is why we have to turn around at the corner.
I thought he was still in D.C.
I don't have any doggy bags left, so neither of us can get too scared right now, okay?
Says he’s on his way to a MAGA rally.
You just had to pee on THAT rock!
On 3, we BOTH roll over and play dead.
Are you sure this is where you buried the bone?
This is why Mom is never home during a full moon.
Go on. Sniff his ass. I dare you.
Just remember, Rex, it's not the size  of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog!
That's what will happen to you if you keep licking yourself.
May I give it one of your treats?
As a comfort dog, you aren’t helping much.
This is nothing, Fluffy. Remember the results of the 2016 election?
Still want to go for a walk?
And that’s why you only get non-GMO dog food.
He's responsible not just for thunder, lost balls and heartworms, but also for... Trump.
OK, I guess we'll finally get to test your theory that you can run faster than me.
Supposedly, owning a pet helps people with their demons.
That’s what you become if you don’t let me clip your nails.
What part of attack are you not understanding?
You're the one who wanted to see some wildlife.
Bark again - obviously it didn't hear you the first time.
Now would be a good time to beg.
That's why you get your vaccines.
See -- he was once the runt of the litter, just like you.
Not to worry, it is just the President of the United States, he will change into something else soon.
Seriously? You couldn’t smell him coming?
Leeeave it!
Not all dogs go to heaven, Steve.
Go easy, I don't need his owner suing me
Don't look at me. You're the one who wanted to go for a walk.
We may have to sacrifice one or two of your doggie treats.
I told you toxic masculinity transcends species.
It’s OK, buddy. I just went #2 too.”
What is it boy? What do you see?
This trainer had several positive reviews on Yelp.
It wants to know if you’re friendly.
Don't be afraid, Fido. Our president will see to it that this species becomes extinct long before he comes any closer.
Unlike you, his bite is worse than his bark.
Oh? You know him?
So long story short, yes, you're adopted.
See? He's been fixed, too.
Oh, so now you choose NOT to bark, but wag your tail....
I guess we all have relatives we don't want to acknowledge.
What do your mean it's outside your purview?
You know, sometimes it's OK to bark.
My friend, we are both feeling inadequate.
See, there’s nothing there.
Yes it's true, your mom was a bitch - but now meet Dad.
Still can't go, eh?
Not barking now, are you?
We’re gonna need a bigger dog.
Let's show him how we can both play dead.
I don't see anything. I told you to lay off of the CBD treats.
It’s not The President, it’s just his son...
You can go ahead and bark your head off now.
If this doesn't make you go, I don't know what will.
No, I don't think a butt sniff is appropriate right now ...
Oh, NOW you're quiet?
How about we visit my side of the family next road  trip?
This is where you growl...maybe bark.
Now it's time for you to earn that premium dog food.
Is this your nightmare or mine?
Now that's a guard dog, Fido.
Well, this is when you get to be man's best friend.
The Parks Department and the Arts Council felt it expressed our nation's angst.
For heaven’s sake will you finally poop?
Good chance to play submissive.
Ignore it—it’s just one of my demons.
Sic ‘em Waffles!
No need to fear--he'll be gone by 2020.
O.K., Fluffy. This is what your police dog training was all about. Attack!
‘Don’t chase the neighborhood cats,’ I said.  ‘They’ll harness the powers of darkness,’ I said.
He's a Basset crossed with a Corgi. And yourself?
I think he just wants to play
Calm down, Rover. It's just Uncle Bob again after a big Trump rally!
Man’s Best Friend meet Man’s Worst Night mare...
Next time you have to use the bathroom at 2 a.m., just go on the floor.
I should have hired a dog walker.
And now you don't bark?
Don't worry, he's more scared of us than we are of him.
Is there any hellish form John Bolton won’t take?
I did warn you about looking for your "real" dad
This would be a good time to break out the cujo routine you usually show to people who come to the front door.
He is to you just as Donald Trump is to me.
Don't even think of humping its leg.
We’re gonna need a few more poop bags.
Pretend it's the mailman!
I don’t care if he’s off his leash, yours is staying on.
The mailman looks different without his uniform, doesn’t he?
Ok, Mister.  Let's see you howl your way out of this one.
Just don't start anything.
Tim will be your counselor this summer.
I’m thinking you skip the usual greeting.
No number two yet?
Ollie, maybe we should stick to the small dog park.
Just let him sniff your butt and maybe he'll leave us alone.
Not so eager to howl now, huh?
Please don't try to sniff his butt.
He's all blood-chilling howls from the depths of hell and no bite.
Pretty sure he's not talking to me.
That ferocious bark might come in handy about now.”
And the vacuum cleaner IS worth barking at?
This is what happened to him after he didn't bring back the ball his owner had thrown.
He swallowed the frisbee. YOU ask for it back.
This is why we had you neutered.
Don't worry, your rabies shots are up-to-date
You're going to have to smell his butt, aren't you
I'm gonna need a bigger dog
We need stricter leash laws.
Well, you were a stray too.
Even I could smell the sulfur.
Maintain eye contact and walk backwards slowly
Aren't you suppose to, like...WARN ME about this type of shit?
It has been a pleasure to serve under you Mr. Alpha Dog.
See what happens when don’t vote Democrat!
Lassie would know what to do in this sort of situation.
We'll give him a chance to back down first.
Don’t be afraid. The President is just having a bad day.
Can your bite to be worse than your bark this time?
Think about what you do next, Sparky. This is the role I've been grooming you for.
You and your sense of smell!
This is exactly why we have leash laws.
Do you mind if I use a couple of your dog treats?
Promise me you'll stay away from steroids.
Do you see what happens when you're not a good boy?
I guess it did say 'likes dogs and long walks in the moonlight'
Look on the bright side, at least it's not a cat
Ok boy,what would Lassie do?
You always bark at the littlest things! What is it now?
I guess naming you Fang was a bit presumptuous...
Of all the mailmen you could have chased...
He really should be on a leash.
See? I told you—skipping one grooming appointment is a slippery slope.
Nobody I know. You?
You bark at the mailman every day, but no warning for this?
Let me quickly explain the principle of  the sacrificial lamb
That reminds me your should have your nails clipped.
No more howling at the moon.
You see, this is what happens when you lick yourself down there.
you couldn't just settle for a walk in the park like the rest of your friends
You're the one that wanted the full moon walk. Now what?
I think it's his chew toy now.
Kill, Rover!
It's not the size of the dog in the fight, Hector, it's the size of the fight in the dog. Bring me home an ear.
Relax. It’s the Bogeyman, not the mailman.
Are you sure you’re a therapy dog?
You just had to beg for a walk on super blood moon night.
She's a service dog, you can't pet her
What ever you do, please don't sniff its butt.
no, that's not just like me before I have my coffee!
It might look scary but it goes out on its own to pee
This is the play date you wanted?
The back yard doesn't seem so bad now, does it?
This is where you leap to my defense.
Confronting your mother was YOUR therapist's idea
It’s you or me, pal. It’s been a good run.
It’s probably not a good idea to try to smell his butt.
You’re sure this is the mailman?
It's OK, Buddy. He's smiling.
Please don’t bark.
If there was ever a time to bark, this is it.
Let's go,  I think it's about to mark it's terority.
Remember when crap like this was frightening?
Yes, I do remember your “little surgery.” What of it?
Doesn't his owner know there's a leash law?
Don't even think about raising your leg!
Time for you to do your man’s best friend thing.
He’s a mixed breed.
Never howl at the moon again
Summon your inner Rin Tin Tin.
A bad boy is always tempting - but trust me, you'll regret it in the morning
Don't be intimidated. He whines at the vet,too.
That’s just the neighbor Dr Jekyll
Okay,you're the emotional support animal--batter up!
I agree...her profile pic was misleading.
Don't show fear . .  . they can smell it.
This is the last time I let you lead.
Hey Buddy, looks like it's an off-leash park!
Thanks to you and your overactive bladder, we're about to be monster chow.
'Seriously, that's your spirit animal?'
Sure, you shed less, but at least he can walk himself.
I read the news everyday...this is nothing.
Well, this is awkward.
Don't even think about humping his leg.
I rescued you, so you owe me!
If you are really interested in her, remember, no means no!
You're just going to have to hold it until we find another rock.
Don't bark, you'll scare him.
I'm hoping this is a friend of yours?
Oh sure.. a falling leaf outside the window and you yap your head off, but for THIS you're, what, skeptical?.
Oh don't worry. He just here to see a man about a dog.
Go easy on him.
What? You suddenly forgot how to bark?
After this, you won't be so scared of the vacuum cleaner.
My fight or flight instinct  is choosing the latter. How about yours?
Don’t worry, we seem to be having the same dream.
This is no time to play hump-the-leg.
You mind if I throw him your treat?
See what happens to little boys who shred the toilet paper?
Just be home by 10.
Whatever happens, don't roll in it.
I don’t suppose you can convince him that you’re the alpha dog?
Not so much the alpha now, are we?
Alright, next time we're following my instincts. Yours are clearly broken.
His owner's an anti-vaxxer.
Steady boy , he’s an endangered species .
See? It’s just Satan!
But I don't need to outrun HIM; I just need to outrun YOU.
Were you planning to start barking any time soon?
See what happens when you grow up without a leash?
Be cool, Rover, it’s just Ken Cuccinelli’s replacement for the Statue of Liberty!”
Still want to move to the country?”
You think he runs away from the neighbors cat?
Bark -- see what happens.
No more walks in the moonlight.
Let’s be optimistic, he could be a vegetarian.
Now is not the time to pretend you’re a hunting dog.
No, Brutus. You are not looking into a mirror.
That's where being off-leash can lead.
It’s a Godzilladoodle. Hypoallergenic and no grooming required.
What do you think? Is he a good boy?
Don't worry. He's more afraid of you than you are of him.
What, you think your breath is any better?
...I don't care if she's in heat, this isn't ideal.
Whatever you do, don’t cry woof.
Attack, Toby, attack!
That's you on steroids.
You should see his owner...
What did I tell you about marking your territory?
Don't judge, Bailey. Not everyone was lucky enough o find a forever home.
I think I'll let you handle this.
Sic 'im, boy.
No worries. It's just Jack Nicholson,
Trust me his bark is much worse than his bite.
Now who needs emotional support?”
This is where you earn your keep as my comfort dog.
And where was that famous sense of smell three minutes ago?
You are not allowed to sniff his behind.
See what happens to doggies who don’t get their vaccines?
This is your imaginary friend, right?
Well... what are you waiting for? Go sniff his butt.
Keep me calm, service dog, keep me calm.
Okay, Mr. Obedience School graduate, let's hear your plan.
See, that’s what happens if you run away overnight Rex.
Let's come back for your bone another day.
I bet that’s who didn’t pick up his poo
You’ll need to find a new favorite spot to pee.
I told you it didn't sound like a Basset Hound!
See? I told you it was nothing.
Well, you're the one who wanted to find your biological father.
Now there's a bad doggie!
Relax, he just wants to sniff your butt.
Just tell him to SIT in your sternest bark.
Hurry up.
C'mon boy, show him who's the daytime alpha male.
Fish and Game must have reintroduced them.
So now you don’t want to bark?
Donald Trump has changed his costume to reflect his personality!
So I guess now’s as good a time as any to prove that whole ‘man’s best friend’ business.
It’s bad enough I have to pick yours up!
Just pee.
Ok, Rufus, here's where you earn your keep.
Woof? That's all you've got, woof?
Great, do you have to go and sniff everything?
Now the question is, can I outrun the dog?
well ?
If you can ignore climate change, this is a piece of cake.
This is what we trained for. Sic 'em.
He is harmless. Just ignore his incessant Twitter feed.
I think we should go to the small dog section of the park.
Now do you understand the difference between Good Dog and Bad Dog?
Where's that ferocious bark the mailman gets every day?
Luke...meet your father.
Just because he howls all night doesn't mean you're allowed to.
I don't have a treat, but I suggest you play dead anyway.
I guess now that he peed on it, you have to, too?
Your DNA results say this is your great, great, great grandmother.
Steady.. Steady... Wait for my signal.
On the other hand, if you win you'll be a hero.
Oh, so this is why the pups look like that.
Let's hope he had lunch.
Beg like you've never begged before.
Apparently someone isn't aware of the leash laws at this park.
I see my ex-brother-in-law still vacations at this lake.
Ok, you win. Next full moon I'll let you shit on the rug.
No, he is not another dog and he doesn't want to play.
Not barking, Fred? I admire your restraint.
It would appear that one of us is about to drop down a notch on the food chain.
This is where you earn your keep"
Sorry,man...we just used our last bag.
Oh boy, what did your little emergency bring us this time?
Are you sure that was who was under your bed?
OK, but I still wasn't wrong when I said you were crying wolf.
Be a good boy. Show Sasquatch how to sit.
Nice job Snoopy, he looks terrified!
Be a good boy and apologize for marking its territory.
Don't chase it; it's not a squirrel.
Not to worry, Rex. It's only a metaphor.
I see you finished your business.
And that's why you ended up with me after the divorce.
Go straight for his nuts!
If you were a cat, I'd be safe inside, cleaning a litterbox now. But no, a dog needs exercise and fresh air.
You've got this Rex."
This is what happens when you don't drain the swamp.
Don’t get any big ideas.
Yes, yes, you were right. You can stop barking now, okay?
I saw that tail wag you traitor!
Your turn to rescue me, buddy.
This dog park sucks every full moon.
Well come on, Beowulf!
I think he stepped in it.
If its tail is wagging we’re okay
Get a good look, Bowser. This is the last of the Satanic She-Wolves that once roamed these hills by the thousands.
Not as scary as mom driving too fast in an SUV, jacked up on Starbucks, and late for soccer practice.
Remind me to stop taking you on walks during a full moon.
Don't worry, Buster.  We all know that Trump turning into a werewolf is fake news.
Well...I don’t know about you, but MY bladder is empty.
Take me for a walk, you whined. What don't you understand about a full moon?
What’s the matter?  Cat got your tongue?
No more puddles in the apartment, or he moves in with us!
Don’t scare him!
No we can't keep him! It's hard enough feeding that Sasquatch we found last week.
Looks like Fluffy is due for a rabies shot.
How come he gets to be off leash?
So much for the leash law.
If you went to the gym you could look like that.
Nope, don't have to pee anymore.
All he needs is an emotional support animal.
Halloween comes early at The White House.
This is your final watchdog test.
That's the last time I'm sharing my stash with you.
No matter how much you howl at the moon, you won't be like him
I really wish people would obey the leash laws.
I might need to borrow your waste bag.
Now THAT’S a guard dog.
Go ahead – I dare you to mark this territory.
You can take him! I got your back
Say hello, Toby, to the nice monster!
Now would be a good time to release that inner wolf.
You bark at leaves but this you’re okay with?
Where's all your 'yap, yap, yapping' now?!
I pay for obedience school, and you don't know the word "sic"?
I don’t have to outrun the monster; just you, Puddles.
You can still try to mark your territory but that may escalate things here.
Have you been swiping right again?
If he wants to sniff, I say let him
You know, you really should have given me a heads up about this.
And this is why I don't let you off leash. Capiche?
I just remembered, Monday is Presidents' Day
He used to be Loch Ness monster before climate change.
You ask him why he gets to be off-leash
See why we never walk this way?
And you just had to be cuter than that big Doberman at the shelter.
Oh, sure, NOW you’re quiet.”
Whatever you do, don't try to sniff his butt!
No, you can't keep it.
And that's why you get your shots.
Fito, how are the mushrooms affecting you now?
Well looks like we’ll both be covered in fur and running on all fours, next full moon.
I know dogs usually don’t know their own size, but trust me on this one.
Uh, this is the part where you heroically sacrifice yourself to save me.
For the first and last time, Casey regretted not getting the Rottweiler instead of the beagle.
‘’Go back to where you came from, Stephen Miller. This is Canada, land of the free. The US is over there across the river.’
I don't think I brought enough doggie bags for the both of you.
Told you we should't have kids
I suppose it’s time I explained to you about puberty.
How's this walk working out for you buddy?
Ok barking hasn't worked, now what?
I don’t think that ‘woof,woof’  is having much effect here...
Sick em, Doris!
Oh, sure, NOW you're not barking!
Dammit, what does it take to make you crap faster?
That's you on drugs.
You would if you were truly my best friend.
I told you it wasn’t a squirrel
Remember, your both good boys, or at least that's what the president thinks!
I bet you he finishes all his canned food.
I told you this walk would kill me.
He’s from a recently melted glacier in Greenland.
And this dream is courtesy of my running shoe you ate yesterday.
Are you happy with your DNA test results NOW?
You know I can outrun you.
No, I'm sorry. You can't pet him.
"And you tell me that you met through a dating app?
He may promise you no leash, but the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
See? This what happens when you refuse to take your shots!
Just sniff each other and see what happens.
What about walking a dog makes it OK for anyone to approach you?
Poop in the house again and he's coming to visit.
Now would be an appropriate time to bark
Didn’t I tell you those off-brand ancestry kits are unreliable?
Please Can we get a dog? You'll never have to walk it, they said."
I thought you barked 'Timmy's stuck in the well!'
He is an emotional support animal.
Well we can count on you not to jump on his leg
Next time swipe left.
This is the last time I play ‘find something starting with W’ with you”
I don't think he wants to share his stick.
Honestly, his profile looked different on the dog walking app.
Beauty, meet Beast.
If I let you off leash, you promise to play nice?
Bite down hard on its ankle while I run and get help.
See what happens when you go off your meds?
This will help you get ready for tomorrow, when our new baby kitten arrives.
Just for appearances sake, could you growl a a little?
I think he wants to play.
Don’t worry, he’ll be heading back to high school soon.
I’ve seen worse—these days it’s in the White House.
You're sure there was nothing unusual about that bone you buried here last week?
He may look big and scary, but he's your father.
He says he's the Chosen one.
Yeah, he does look lost, but I'm still not calling his master.
Ten bucks says he's a contractor.
Don't bark--you may aggravate a Trump follower.
Maybe this will make you go poop.
So this is the Ancestry DNA match you were telling me about?
I knew I should have picked the Rottweiler.
Who's the good snack? Your the good snack.Good snack!
Every family's got one.
Don't worry, I heard he's had his rabies shot.
Does he make you feel as inadequate as I feel?
Sic 'em!”
This is what you woke me up for?
Play dead.
Don't worry.Mom's only like this when the moon is full.
I see he didn’t make his master schlep out in the cold with a leash ... and would it kill you to bark?
Well, her profile did say she was a dog person.
That's right - just stand tall and make yourself look bigger than you really are
You bite the mailman but with him you want to play?
No, we can't take it home to keep you company.
You're sure Timmy fell down the well?
No, it's not real. Just go pee on it as usual.
There, you scared him.  Are you happy now!
Someone you know?
It's time you met my mother-in-law.
Alright, I'm sorry I accused you of making all that noise. Are you happy now?
See, the full moon affects everyone a little differently.
Do your snarl, Tobey.
This is what happens to bad dogs who chew slippers and pee on the carpet.
Don't worry.  He's got a collar.
Yeah, "shortcut"
Don't get too close. He might have fleas.
If you would stop chasing the squirrels, you, too, could be off your leash.
You should see what MY ancestors look like!
Now you know what happens when you nibble those wild mushrooms!
Get ready to run......I'm gonna criticize his personal hygiene to see what happens.
Still want to pee in the house?
That's what happens to doggies who pee inside.
I've told you this already - size doesn't matter.
I'm not sure "his bark is bigger than his bite" applies here.
This off-leash dog park is really getting out of hand.
You couldn’t have gone at home, huh?
This is what all that crazy barking of yours was about?
Am I the only one that saw the "keep pets on leash" sign?
What do you mean, no?
You were sure that you were the "alpha" with the Pomeranians and pugs back at the dog park, weren't you?
You told me your cousin was a goldendoodle mix.
Remember how I said one day you'll thank me for having you spayed?
No.  I'll pick it up when the moon isn't full.
He used to be a dog who wasn't a good boy.
will you stop with the wistful gaze!
Look and learn. This is how I want you to be when my ex-wife comes to the door.
We're naming him 'Rover' and the two of you will just have to work out arrangements about the doggie bed.
He better pick that up
Don't even think about it.
Ready to go home?
He's your relative, you talk to him.
What do you suggest now, Mr Peabody?
Let's find a new favorite rock to pee on.
How many times do I have to tell the neighbors not to use that high-protein dog food they buy at the fitness center.
If we get out of this alive, I'm going to need that extra poop bag.
Yes, seriously,
 this is why I got you!
Don't worry, it's just Brexit. It doesn't actually exist
Don't be afraid.  He will only be a one term president.
The dog park during a full moon wasn't a good idea.
Is your dog friendly?
It thinks you’re cute......
Oh, so maybe you're not the top-dog
You sure this is the guy who bit you, Jen?
Don’t worry, he’s all gruesome, bloodcurdling howling and no bite
How am I supposed to know how it self-identifies?
Go big or go home.
Pretty sure your flea collar isn't gonna do much for you here.
So, where's your inner wolf when we need it ?
Don't make the first move.
Oh great... Your mother is here...
You're up, Sparky!
Remember: Never show fear.  That's my job
Because the law requires you to have a leash, that's why.
Return Of Drain The Swamp Thing
Is it okay if it pets you?
Well, you wanted to meet your biological dad...
I just hope they name the species after me
Don't get any ideas, Fluffy
OK here's you big chance, sick 'em!
At least pretend to defend me!
Every dog has it’s day but I think you should probably leave the nights to this fella.
Specifically, what part of you is Pit Bull?
Don’t worry. It’s just another Trump supporter.
You said you were bored and wanted more excitement in your life.
Why can't you stick to tracking squirrels?
We're early.  He just needs a moment to change.
Jerry, eat a snickers...
Don't worry.  It only eats humans.
Lucky for you I'm a vegan monster.
Oscar, I guess you just pissed on the wrong tree
This is the moment I have spoiled you for.
I have a scary thought.
Stand down,Thor, and let him pass.
I told you, I hate visiting your family on full moon days...
I dare you to sniff its butt.
No barking, Milo. We don’t want to scare it.
What is it, boy?
I told you not to pee on the grass.
What a CUTE dog you have! He doesn’t bite, does he?
It’s either the full moon or the new dog food?
Beagle, Beezlebub. Beezlebub, Beagle.
Now you know why I don't let Barry take you for a walk during the full moon.
I told you what can happen to you if you drink out of the toilet!
This is the ex I was telling you about.
This dog park isn't so crowded in the evening.
We are NOT taking him home.
You see, Fido, THAT’S the way to howl at the moon.
This is why I wanted a cat.
Yes, he's principal of that new obedience school.
Who knew the Chosen One would look like this.
This is when we both make a poopy.
No Sweetie, it doesn't want a treat!
Is that you Donald?
This should scare the crap out of you.
I told you they're serious about keeping off the grass around here.
We're going to need a bigger leash.
Just pretend it's a squirrel.
OMG, Your dog sooo cute. May I pat him?
This might be a good time for you to do your business.
He's your new trainer.
You know, Roosevelt, the Democrats might have found a viable candidate after all!
Roll over and play dead - I’ll follow your lead.
I swear, mini weredoodles are going to be the next big thing.
Relax, at sunrise he goes back to being a mild-mannered accountant.
Your cousin’s a real dick.
Not so tough outside the house, are you?
You can play with him, but no biting.
Feel free to bare your teeth and launch yourself into the air to protect me.
Try your signature ‘yap, yap, yap.’
Now you see where running off without your leash leads to?
It’s the size of the fight in the dog Rufus.
And they make me put YOU on a leash?
You bark at me. You bark at the moon. How about bark at this?
So as that best friend thing goes, you got this, right?
Sendak unplugged.
Update: Sunday in the Park with George.
If that doesn’t scare the poop out of you, nothing will.
It's just your imagination. Don't bark and let's do a 180.
Next time let's stick to the dog park
Sic 'em, Bruno....
I wouldn't try to smell him.
Just take the damn picture.
But the doorbell upsets you.
Be a good Boy, and let me give him one of your treats?
Don’t look so innocent. I know you summoned him.
See? This is why you don’t dig for bones under a grave.
I can't prove it, but I'm thinking it was you who took Daddy's special mushrooms.
At least I don't have to pick up his poop.
Because leash laws don't apply to monsters.
This is what happens if you don't wear your tick collar.
Not as scary as President Trump, is it?
He'll be training you starting Monday.
See if he’ll pet you while I go get the car.
Damn, I forgot the doggie treats.
This is nothing compared to what I see in the news.
I know he’s not the mailman, but you could make an effort.
See here, if I didn't wash and groom you, this is what you'd become.
See what happens when you ditch doggy day-care?
Thanks, Marty!  You'll growl at your own shadow, bark at the dryer bell, but for this-- nothing!
At least you could spin around and insanely bark like you do for the mailman.
I don't know these days if it's something mythical
or if I'm just viewing other media outlets.
Is this why you never want to go out for a walk?
Make it your assertive best.
Last time I let you choose the route.
Are you happy now?!  I warned you not to dig too deeply into your ancestry!
Good thing you marked your territory.
So maybe we don't sniff this one's butt.
In planning your next move, recall that you are man's best friend.
Really?!  What's it gonna take to get you to do your business?
What did I tell you about online dating?
Imagine him wearing a postal uniform.
I guess sic'em is out of the question?
Let's play nicely this time, Toby.
Beautiful night for a moon dance.
No, I don’t think you should sniff him there either.
Looks like we're both going to shit on this walk.
That’s why you are getting the distemper vaccine, Tibbles.
Now I don’t want to hear another word about it!”
'Dog walking will extend your lifespan,' she said...
He's vegan
Just let it snilffyour butt.
Visualize him taking your Snausages.
Don’t worry. It’s not Donald Trump.
Out of curiosity, you transfixed or frozen?
Frank, meet your brother from another mother.
I warned you. Rufus,” I said, “I’ll take you to meet your bio mom but she’s a real bitch
You've got this -- right!
You chewed her shoes. What do you expect?
I would recommend you avoid your usual "get aquainted" sniff.
I'm Rod. My dog and I are taking an evening stroll in the twilight -- zone.
Let me guess, you want to sniff his butt?
Please don't sniff his butt.
Ignore him. He's more afraid of us than we are of him.
Bark louder.
Where's your all-night, yippy bark now?
I agree, the vacuum cleaner is way scarier than this.
Back to the small dog side?
Go on, you've had to mark all the other rocks.
My ex....I can't go anywhere without running into her.
He is not a good boy.
We can't afford to feed your friend, and that's final.
Not so yappy now are ya?
See, this is why I don't feed you after midnight.
This is what you want to be for Halloween?
Are you going to just let him say that without a response?
I blame universal health care.
Don’t worry, he’s all bite and no bark.
Well, what did you THINK would happen if you bit him?
What? Cat got your tongue?
Now do you believe me that not EVERY smell needs to be explored?
It's supposed to be waxing gibbous.
I knew I should have brought garlic!
That's why we keep you on a hormone-free organic diet.
Ok. You better talk or we’re both in trouble.
It's a werewolf. Be careful if you smell its butt.
You can give it a try but I’m not sure that’s how they say hello.
You always preferred my ex-wife.
Nothing shocks me anymore!
Don't even THINK about sniffing its butt.
Don't worry--it's just the President.
Your free to attack whenever you want
Look Fido, the rare Werewolf-Doodle
You growl at butterflies, but you're okay with this guy?
Here's another fine mess you've gotten me into.
Relax.  It's just another recession scare.
I told you not to mess with ancestry.com.
Remember what we discussed about behaving like a chihuahua?
If I were you, I wouldn't mark my territory here.
You can try, but I think it’s his patch of grass now.
I'd say he's looking at you.
I'm tired of the sidewalk," you said. "Take me off-trail," you said
I already told you, buddy. We can't take it home.
A bark would be nice.
Make it quick
I see neither Timmy, nor a well.
Don't even think about the butt sniff.
This is the dog park, where you want is the wolf park across the street.
Now do you see why I'm reluctant to take you for a walk!
Okay, Fluffy--time to put those emotional support skills to work.
Yes, my dog is seriously contemplating peeing on this thing.
It's too late to cancel the play date now.
This is why we only won 2nd place in the county fair.
Let him sniff your bum and we’ll be alright.
Just pretend it's the neighbor's cat
You just had to howl, didn't you?
This is what happens when you chew on my socks.
Just another non indigenous species that has outgrown its cuteness.
You want to take this one or should I?
You were the one who insisted on DNA testing to find your ancestors.
See? That would be the definition of that 'bad dog' I mentioned earlier.
I named you David for a reason.
Ask him about the frisbee, nicely!
And this was advertised as a pet friendly neighborhood.
Well, do something!
It looks like your usual spot is not an option anymore.
I hope he brought a bag!
That's what we have trained for. Attack Snoopy.
At least he doesn't shed
Still nothing?
That's not a good boy.
He's bluffing!
Ok, you’ve see it, now let’s go.
Werewolf, there wolf. Satisfied?
He just wants to play.
Man’s best fiend.
Like I said, there's nothing to bark at.
Don't be scared. He identifies as a cat.
I know you don't want to hear this, but I think your friend's been juicing.
Ok, who’s the jerk ignoring the ‘on leash’ sign?
So maybe single use plastics aren't the biggest eco problem today.
Just let him smell you so we can get this over with
Play nice, now.
It eats dog poop--or you.  Your choice.
Don't worry Rocket, there's two of us and only one of him!
But does he get belly rubs every morning?
I can't wait for this election cycle to be over.
Good luck finding a flea collar for him.
Not too close, Rover. It might have ticks.
Now do you see why you shouldn't howl?
Am I the only one who respects the leash laws around here?
See, this is what you become if you drop out of obedience school.
You're still my big bad woof
You can play with Wanda tomorrow when she's no longer in her full moon heat.
Bare your teeth, growl, and puff yourself up!
Be Nice!
Believe me, You won‘t get any treats from him either!
I don’t see you racing over to sniff that!
No, you already had a play date today.
Make sure your finger's not over the lens.
This is your mentor?
I knew we should have gotten a cat.
No, you can’t pee on him. He is the “chosen one.”
His bark is worse than your bite.
Do you realize now that digging up other people's bones isn't acceptable?
That’s your famous uncle Otto. He’s the first Pomeranian to become fully self-actualized.
She may want to sniff your butt.
The President looks so much better on TV.
Ok, I'll ask them. She wants to know who's your groomer.
Just don’t look him in the eyes.
This is why I didn't want to visit your family."  Submitted by Zachary Rau
Great,he's off leash.
I’m not gonna tell him he’s drawn poorly, you tell him.
You’re supposed to help me meet women.  A guy with a monthly cycle doesn’t count.
Have you ever thought that maybe you're a little too snoopy?
See buddy, it's just a huge, terrifying monster.
I'm guessing that the neighbor's cat is looking pretty good about now...
The Hound of the Baskervilles meets the Beagle of the Howards
And I thought the climb up here was a beast.
You start sniffing her enthusiastically while I run like hell.
I bet HE picks up his own poop...
This is what happens after you bite an infected cat.
You got this. He looks just like our mailman.
Where's all that nonstop barking now?
Stay, Baxter. I've learned from hard experience that it is best to keep out of Mommy's way when she has "the curse."
In the future, no walkies at moonrise .
Walk the dog, she said.  It will be good for your health, she said
If you were more like that dog people wouldn't steal my packages.
I told you it was too late for a walk.
Looks like mom has the curse again.
This is what can happen if you don't let me clip your nails.
Now would be a good time to find your inner Were-Dog!
What do you mean 'we', white canine?
They say his bark is worse than his bite.
But you can hear the mailman coming from a mile away.
Pooch, I am your father.
Be a good boy and stay. I’ll go get help.
It's not the Big Bad Wolf, Sparky, just someone's creation myth.
Even he doesn't howl at the moon.
This is the part where you heroically sacrifice yourself to save me, right?  Right...?
Apparently you don't understand how to take advantage 
of a full moon.
I think we're gonna need another poop bag
I’m going to run. Hold the wolf off for forty-five seconds, without revealing any semblance of fear.  Then follow me.  Good puppy.
So this is your new friend Tommy? Well I don't think he is suitable_for your "Show and Tell" at Puppy Camp.
It’s not a cat.  Quit being such a baby!
This is where you take the lead.
Let's see what they taught you in guard dog camp
... but did you stop howling at the moon? No!
So much for being constipated.
Are you just going to stand there?
Sniff his butt, and he might calm down.
No, Fluffy, I don't think he wants to play.
But is he electable?
And this is why you should never post single ads on “Where Wolf.com”.
You pee when you see any fire hydrant & bush we pass but THIS gets no reaction???
Relax!  He'll just sniff you and be gone.
Does he smell odd to you?
Don’t they know we have leash laws in this park.
If you tell him I'm a dog person, we're both toast.
Not to worry, Fluffy. It's just another blow-hard relative of Mr. Trumps.
Still don't need to go?
So, there’s your ancestor.
This is what mama turns into when you pee on the rug!
To be the devil's advocate, you do look quite tasty.
Now who is the big bad woof?
Don't just stand there. Sic
Come on, you're an alpha dog!
Remember, YOU were the one who wanted to go for a walk!
Yes, your antidepressant may cause hallucinations. Why?
See what happens when you don't take your heartworm pill?
Now is a good time to bark.
I told you if you didn’t stop peeing on the couch that there would be trouble.
People change.
now where's the narrator
You were the one who wanted to go for a walk
So are you going to bark at it or what
I told you not to dig in the backyard!
Your the one that had to go out and I’m the one that just took a crap!
THIS is why dogs should never eat cat food or beg to go potty in the middle of the night.
Quit your whining.  Your mom's a poodle.
I told you no good would come of howling at the full moon.
Mommy says you're 'all bark and no bite'. Well, here's your chance!
Mom needs a Snickers bar.
Todd, I only need to be faster than you.
Finally found where the wild things are!
And you wanted to go on a midnight walk.
If all existence is just illusion, it's safe to continue our walkies.
Oh, I see- too good for Vicki's labradoodle, but NOW you're interested?
Don't you remember him?  He was your class valedictorian at obedience school.
If we don’t move, he won’t see us...
I don't care if you sniffed a fat truffle there, he can have it.
… and if you don’t want her coming after you on the next full moon I’d suggest you stop eating her shoes.
He doesn’t want you to pee on that one.
I left the stove on. Boy, I think we should turn around.
Don't try to tell me she looked better in her profile picture
Not so tough now, are you Mr. Barky.
You go for the jugular; I'm getting the hell out of here!
I got nothin, champ.
If you’re going to transform, now would be the time.
NOW you stop barking!
I don’t think your “arf” is going to cut it.
All that barking at home and now you don't have to go?
He says it’s always been his tree, too, buddy. Let’s just move on.”
Now, maybe, you'll stop digging.
Is this a relative of yours?
Hey, I thought they drained the swamp.
So you just had to go walkies, huh.
Do you still think you want to answer the call of the wild?
Let's stick to chasing squirrels.
Jack London is a hack.
We just need to show love to his hate
That's it little guy -- give him your 'no bark--big bite look.
Trump appointed me Environment Secretary, why?
They'll erect a statue for anything these days.
I still like him better than the one we don't know.
So are to cool if I grab a coffee while you have your play date?
Oh, NOW you're ready to poop.
You're the one who wanted to go on Ancestor.com!
I told you not to rub your leg on that lamp.
He won't attack. He's been nominated for a Cabinet post.
I would expect at least a little growling from you at this point.
Don't be so standoffish - go sniff his butt.
You know I am very open, but I don't think this is a good match.
You know the kennel said you were a guard dog, right?
Don't try and sniff his butt!
Trust me, no matter how long you've been hanging on, this is not the tree you're looking for.
Try to find his weak spot buddy.
Let's hope his roar is worse than his bite.
And that’s what will become of you if you keep pooping in the house!
Now, be nice to the other doggie, Princess.
This is our leader. He's a little rough around the edges, but you'll accept him just like the rest of us. After all, we're Republicans!
'Attack dog' is earned, buddy, not inherited.
Every time I take you on a walk, strange things happen. I'm getting a gold fish.
Oh no I forgot a poop bag.
''NO that is NOT the mailman!''
You can grow up to be big and strong just like him
Are you sure you two are related?
You guys are cousins, right? Just talk to him.
This is why you get GMO-free kibble.
Come on, he only wants to sniff.
Don't worry. He's already had two reprimands from the SPCA. He can't afford a third.
Don’t
And this is why we don’t go to the off leash parks.
He has worse breath than you.
That’s George before he gets his first cup of coffee.
Is this the cousin you told me about?'
OK Snowflake, now you try it. Remember, ears up, growl, show teeth, and a little wider stance.
You seeing this?
Some best friend you are.
Aren't you the one who barks and snarls at the scary mailman?
Really, I think you can take him.
you been pooping in his yard,again ?
Beelzebub?  What a ridiculous name!  Is it Moscow Beelzebub or just Beelzebub?
Let's set genealogy aside and keep walking.
You got this sparky
That's not what I meant by "I'm looking for a dog person."
Is this the relative no one speaks about?
It won’t hurt you to take the dog for a walk she said.
I know it's not fair, but he was probably on his leash twenty minutes ago.
You don't, by any chance, speak werewolf, do ya boy?
See. Climate change is not a myth.
Do you suppose you might muster a little growl perhaps?
Now are you going to listen when I say, "Bad dog"?
If you poop in the house again he’s your new daddy.”
Yeah, yeah, I know, three riddles to pass...
I can assure you I did not vote for him.
You bark at the neighbour's Great Dane. What's the difference?
Ask if it wants a treat. It'usually works like a charm for me.
Piper, this is Carpet Cleaner Man. Now, let’s go potty.
Now you see why I got custody.
Who let him in here? It’s clearly marked for dogs under 25lbs.
No, Fido, I am not a bargaining chip!
What do you mean “You sic this one?”
See? When you confront your fears, it's not nearly as scary."
Yes, he’s literally a monster, but tax cuts.
Let’s not sniff this one’s butt, okay, Duke?
Now, Sparky, when I said 'Make friends' yesterday this is not what I had in mind.
That's what happens when you bark for no reason in the middle of the night
He guards all the President's golf courses.
Why do you think I feed you "Mighty Dog"?
Sometimes things are what they seem to be.
Don’t worry, you’ve had your rabies shot.
This is when you offer emotional support, Buddy.
And yet, squirrels are scarier how?
You just HAD to go for a walk!
I don't think that was a friendly growl.
Even that won't make you poop?
Still want to whine about the invisible fence?
Go ahead, sniff his but."
Don’t let him scare you; he’s up for re-election
Let's pause our walk until Mrs Gelson has had her morning coffee.
Don’t worry, he’s harmlesss
I've become inured to these scare tactics.
This is what happens when you have to pee at 3:00AM!
Finally - something we actually needed a tariff on.
Whatever you do, don’t ask if it’s that time of the month.
Well, get a good workout routine and eat right and yeah, that could be you someday.
And your little dog,too!
Kalessi, do something!
I know I told you your father was a lab...But the truth is your father was invented in a lab.
Christopher Canaan, New Hope PA
Good dog, Sparky. Trust your instincts.
ok,  NOW DO YOU HAVE TO GO ?
If you were more like Sweetums here you too could go off leash.
Snurt, I'd like you to meet our new rescue, Hairy Freaky Beast. Now be nice.
I think the squirrels brought in the heavy artillary.
Why don’t we skip the alpha dog contest this time?
I know that look – you will not sniff his butt!
This would not be a good time not to lift your leg.
No, this isn't EXACTLY like that time we saw The Rock at Whole Foods.
Well, you said you wanted to meet your ‘real’ father.
Look who's too good for the leash law
I've never seen one before either.
A werewolf.  Once, your kind were a wolf too.
Now we know who has been pooping in our yard!
You just had to mark your territory.
Be careful what you ask for... we only have 3 wishes.
I hate it when people think they don't need a leash!
You wanna go smell his butt?
What are you waiting for, dog ? Sic 'em
It's okay, he's a rescue.
See, you can be whatever you want to be.
Are you going to let him bully you?
nothing like a morning walk to fight off your inner demons.
So you're not actually a "guard dog," you just really hate UPS. Do I have that right?
So he's the one behind all the robocalls.
And yet the mailman sets you off.
Okay Fido. This is your chance to be man's best friend.
I'm wondering the same thing. Who's taking our picture?
See, I told you it wasn't the neighbor's cat.
Don't turn around, Pixie, he doesn't appear to be spayed.
Do you need to go NOW?
did you bring the snickers bar?
Don't worry, he won't replace you.
Leash laws at this dog park are a joke.
Well, go on. Scare him off.
Don't  be afraid, I have your back.
I'm not picking this one up.
Hard to believe that he was once just a little toxic byproduct.
Perhaps if I don't make eye contact, he won't ask to pet my dog.
Now would be a good time to unlearn your good citizen training.
Now you know how we feel.
OK, here’s the plan: I’ll go get help while you go sniff her butt.
I'm sorry if you can you smell my fear
You didn't bring your bone did you?
Duffy, now is not the time to be a brave dog.
I think it wants us to take a selfie,
Now you don't bark?
This is what happens to bad dogs.
Hope you're happy now because I just peed in my pants!
So you'll bark at grandma but not this?
And that is what will happen to you, if you don't keep taking your flea and tick medication.
You dragged me all the way out here to see this?
He's only available once a month but they say he's the absolute best trans species relationship therapist in the business!
What do you mean you've always wanted a baby brother?
Who's the real monster here? At least he didn't poop in my shoe.
At least we know he’s not carrying a concealed weapon.
This is why you shouldn't lie on your dating profile.
I wouldn't sniff this one's butt if I were you.
Not so tough now that we're out of the car.
This is the last time I take you on a blind date.
It's the wife's turn to walk the dog, but I should be glad to do it she says, 'cuz it's so beautiful out with the full moon . . .
It’s just reality, don’t worry.
Relax! You don't taste that good.
You never complained about traditional roles all the years I’ve worn a plastic bag on my hand.
So, do you want to talk to him or should I?
You should start barking NOW!!
Well I hope you’re happy now, Mr. “Won’t go within a mile of the house.”
That's what happens when you eat your own poop.
Now will you poop?
Ah, it's off-leash hours.
Always knew you were all bark and no bite.
Don’t worry, Baxter, he’s ‘no bark, all bite.’
Go ahead, just growl back.
Be gentle.
Excuse me sir, you're in our way.
This is what will happen if you fail obedience school.
Now you know why they don't let him in the dog run during a full moon.
Luke, I am your father.
Who's not realizing their full potential at
 the dog run now?
Still glad you signed up for that ‘find your ancestors gene test’”
....and think about how strong the puppies will be. Besides, the stud fee is non-refundable.
I’m sorry but you still have to “do your business” before we go home.
Do you see what I see?
WOLF, not WOOF!
You know... you bark a big game.
One of us should be barking aggressively.
Just do your poop so we can get the hell out of here.
I knew we should have gotten you spayed.
Go ahead, bark!
I guess I'm the bitch now...
At my friends you bark, but now? Nada
You know, Sparky, in your DNA there werewolves.
Now’s a good time to show your dominance.
If it wants to smell your butt, let's just go with it.
I'm really not sure...is it one of your relatives or one of mine?
Just think, Rex, all this used to be glacial.
So that's the guy you were with before I found you at the rescue center?
A threat? No, I think we need more facts.
He's so cute. Has he had his rabies shot yet?
When I drop the leash, you go for the jugular.
Can I borrow your doggie bag?
The neighbors said he doesn't bite, but I'm not buying it tonight.
You rescue me this time.
You see why I picked you.
I'm over the moon.
Just pretend he identifies as a poodle.
Just like he said Sparky, we need immigration reform
Doesn't this werewolf's owner know it's a leashed park?
Don't worry. It's a vegan.
Let’s go, Boy. I don’t think we’re going to see any any bunnies tonight.
Rusty, this is why leashes are so important.
Oh, and by the way, one of the possible side effects of your new flea collar is the chance of hallucinations.”
George, I said it's OK to chase squirrels - this is not a squirrel!
Great... Now I'll have to clean up two piles.
THIS is who you wanted to set me up with?
Save it until he goes back to being our mailman.
Did you change our dosage again?
Now that we've both done our business, let's go home.
Are you saying you can see this too?
Maybe if you growl ----
Not so keen on barking now, are you?
Can you just do your business so we can go home?
I told you about eating table scraps
Don't judge me, I made the deal with him when I was eight
Kill the man. I can be your best friend.
What do you mean `sometimes it really is the size of the dog in the fight`?
What....nothing to say ?
That little bit of DNA makes you howl at the moon
I should've gone with the German Shepherd
I don't think he cares this is an on-leash park?
Relax boy. You're mother is just going through menopause.
This could be you if you don't finish school....
Come on, Stanley, do your business and let's go home.
Remind me to bring an extra ball.
Do NOT try to sniff his butt, Roy.
Don't worry its just mommy back from the sales at the Mall
Obviously the guy he's looking for has a "Boufront" hairdo and hangs out in the Oval Office.
Don't just stand there.  Attack!
You're birth father. Happy now?
Just pee, will you.
I’m so glad I can run faster than you.”
Yes it’s off-leash — what’s the problem?
So much for happy little trees.
Were you trolling the Internet again?
The  last presidential election was scarier than he is!
So what do you say? Next time we'll stick with the dog park?
Welp you tracked down the scent,now what?
I'm the one who should be shaking, you're just the appetizer.
You agree, he is a bit too melodramatic?
Please tell me that’s a friend of yours.
You bark like crazy at your own reflection, but this — nothing?
It’s just a vacuum cleaner, Max.
Don’t be so dramatic. He’s just our mailman.
Are you going to play nice this time like we talked about?
Don't be scared.  Your therapy human is right here.
Given the magnitude of our current situation, I'm guessing that 'sic im'  would be ill-advised.
Come along Buddy.  I don't think he plays well with others.
I adopted you for a reason.
And yet you bark at the mailman.
Now Gordon, this is what happens when you pee on the carpet."
You must be kidding, that's your dad?
Well, you did ask for help with the neighborhood cat.
I thought I was your best friend
Is there no where we can go to get away from politics?
But socializing is important at your age.
Do not make eye contact.
Now. Play nice!
The dog therapist says you have to face your fears.
Really? Are you sure you can't pee anywhere else?
I bet he just wants to sniff your butt.
See. This is what you were barking your damn fool head off over.
How long has this been going on?
He wants to know if you marked his spot.
Now will you hurry up and pee?
Now is the time to bring out the wild beast that you really are.
No...it's not your father.
It was you scratching at the door for a night walk. Own this moment.
Now do you have to go?
Anyone you know?
Your turn.
So this is the Brad you just play fetch with?
Rex, stop staring, werewolves don't like it when we stare.
If you learn to growl like that, you will be more useful.
Well if you don’t know what it is it can’t eat you.
Maybe Tinder is not for you.
Do you feel like showing your combat training or we just leave?
no - he is not lost and no - we can't take him home with us.
Think you can lick him?
Muffy, trust me, you’re going to want to roll over for this one.
I wanted you to meet my nightmare
See, I TOLD you that people don't really look like their online dating profile pictures! Are you still sure I was trying to ruin your life when I told you not to go out with this guy?
Your birth dad won unsupervised visitation."
I don’t care what his parents let him do, you’re not allowed off-leash in the enchanted forest.
Leash laws? Please!
Want to try off-leash today?
I told you this place was a hell hole.
What if I told you he worked for UPS?
We better play dead.
That would be your cue to bark.
So, this is what you're running away from in your sleep?
Don’t stare, you’ll make him feel that he’s odd.
So I'm thinking, now, maybe you'll bring the ball back when I throw it?
I did say, “...you maybe disappointed when you meet your real dad!”
But, Noo!
No more Netflix for you.
i think that adding  CBD  oil to your food   has helped to calm you down so far.
I guess we can't walk here any more since they drained the swamp.
Remember it's not the size of the dog in the fight, but  the size of  the fight in the dog.
How are you afraid of your own reflection in the dishwasher but not this?
I think he can smell fear, too.
Yes, you're distantly related, but he's not really "man's best friend" material.
He says his home has become unbearably hot so he is moving up here.
Just think of him as the mailman!
Don’t worry. It’s just someone with a different opinion.
We're not going to need that doggie bag after all
I told you to stay on the trail.
Perhaps skip scent marking this spot today.
No, you can't sniff him.
OK, you've answered the call of the wild. Now what?
His bark is worse than his bite.
Wait here Fido, I think I left something back at camp!
Kill.
I told you sooner or later marking your spot for dominance was going to be challenged
Owner to dog,  ATTACK “Dog to Owner , RETREAT
And the note said "midnight at the bog for all-you-can-eat doggy treats"?
I know it looks like a tree and you have an urge to pee, but trust me on this one.
I told you this territory was already claimed...
Sure, you can sniff his butt as long as I don’t have to talk to his owner.
This would be a good time for you to bark menacingly.
The next panel is not for the faint of heart.
I told you, all dogs do not go to heaven.
Nothin'?  2 hours of an insane, foamfest at a bobblehead and now you've got nothin'?
No . . . I don't think it's a vegetarian.
How long will this take?
I don’t think you have met my mother-in-law.
Frankly, I don’t think it much matters whether it’s a werewolf or an ogre. We’re screwed.
Go get him.
Well? Either sniff his butt or don't, but let's go! Jeopardy starts in five minutes!
He can smell fear.
Easy boy, after 2020 you won’t have to fight him.
That's a bad dog.
Well, let's see what I get from paying for your guard dog training.
Sorry, buddy. It’s a dog-eat-dog world.
How does he get away with no leash?
It's the black sheep of our family, Bailey.
Can you take care of this, my trusted little friend, or do I have to get involved?
It's times like this that I regret having you neutered.
He didn't get his coffee today!!!!
don't look in his eyes!
Sic em, Rex!
Does emotional support includes fighting monsters?
Don't worry, it's just an election-year recession rearing its ugly head.
Attack, Spike!
Don’t worry, its just our HOA making sure you’re on a leash.
OK, Sally Lou, let’s turn real slow-like and head for home.  Nooooo    running and Nooooo barking!
Oh, okay. Now you stop barking.
This is the kind of intimidation I'm looking for you to provide while we're away from the house.
Is he related on the Wolf side of the family?
That reminds me, did I forget to feed the cat before your walk?
See, this is what happens if you ask for food after midnight.
This is where the wild things live Maurice
Hey buddy, go git ‘im.
That's why you always must be nice to girl dogs.
NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HIS SQUEAKY THING IS.
I hate running into my boss in public
It's either a meme or a trope.
Thanks for not barking
It’s ok to bark!
In retrospect, wouldn't the wee-wee pad have been a better idea?
And that's why we need a wall.
Meet your father; he's got a bit of an opioid problem
If he thinks that I’m going to pick up his poop too he’s got another thing coming.
You couldn't resist howling at the full moon could you?
This reunion is touching, but it's time you were told that your brother was adopted.
Don’t embarrass me now.
You're always claiming to be a guard dog. Here's your chance.
Good thing we had you fixed...
Sorry Old boy, this is my new support animal.
Squirrel
If he attacks, don't be too rough on him when you pin him down.
So, genius, what’s your answer to The Call of the Wild?
All that barking and it's just Grendel...
I see how it is--no mail uniform, and you clam up.
They call this, the "Things that go howl in the night."
Don't be scared, Sparky, it's only the president.
Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?
Lupin, Sirius, and Snape reunite by moonlight
I think that's the ghost of the neighbor's cat, isn't it?
He doesn't need a leash.
You just had to go to the bathroom during our drive through the mystical evil Forest, didn't you jerry...
When I said 'nice doggie,' I wasn't talking to you.
Relax it's just a Labra-Demon.
Tick season is getting worse.
Well this explains a thing or two about that unexpected litter of pups you graced us with!
This is why mommy can’t sleep with you tonight. Ok? Satisfied?
You sound ferocious when the mailman walks up to the house.  And now, you've got nothing?
Now you see why she is my ex.
Shouldn’t you be sniffing each other’s  butts right now?
Perhaps if we stay absolutely still......it'll make absolutely no difference.
‘It’s just a cat.’
I thought it would be better if you met on neutral territory.
And you met this guy on Tinder?
It's just a bad dream.
Come on, he just wants to say hello.
See, I told you there would be consequences for all those evil little things you do.
Stay... stay... good boy!
I'm telling you for the last time it's just a squirrel
Hey! It was YOUR idea to go for a walk on the full moon!
I think its time you left your safe space.
Maybe we should have come to the dog park earlier.
That's the Ghost of Elections Yet To Come.
I think I read they're vegetarians.
Sure. Now you point.
Neither of us should be opting for mild puzzlement right now.
Here’s the plan. I’m going to throw you at it and run.
Let’s see, Skippy. I’ll work on our escape while you sniff his crotch.
Don't worry it will be OK. The Pres. just had the normal bad week with most of the World plotting against him. Some golf will surely help him out.
Do you mind if we get a quick selfie?
He'll feed you while I'm away at the fantasy con.
Remember when I told you there would be consequences if you continued to resist house training?
Ugh, full moon Mondays.
Imagine scooping his poop!
I guess this is as good a time as any to suggest showing a little more ambition.
It has a lot to do with how you are raised.
Let's just turn around. It's getting late.
Let's find another tree, OK Rocky?
Who does he think he is, breaking the leash law?
Honey, the neighbors have a new dog."
Oh, don't be such a drama queen. We're just out for a walk.
See Sparky?  THIS is why we always stay in the fenced backyard.....
I may need to borrow the poop bag I brought for you.
What part of 'attack' did you not understand?
I told you the dog park has changed.
See, this is what I'd expect you to grow into.
About last night... you might want to get tested.
The good news is, I see you’ve finally gone.
I hope the puppies get your temperament.
I said, "Sic!"
I hate when you bring your work friends over.
You know this guy?
I may need you to translate here.
I think it’s time to hire a gardener with less exciting taste in topiary
Now you see what I'm talking about, he's got game!
It's my ex. Yes, the controlling one.
I think he already peed there, buddy...
Sorry Buddy, a deal is a deal.
Nothing like the smell of the Great Outdoors
Yes!  His bite IS worse than his bark!
Don't worry. It's just a myth.
All that salami before bed was a mistake.
Now would be a good time to play dead.
So you had to pee eh?
Now that is a real monster.
Well, here’s another nice mess you’ve gotten me into”
This wouldn't happen if I owned a cat.
Does that smell like a rabbit to you?
Well, at least try to pee.
Don't worry -- I got you that tick collar.
No! I'm the chosen one!
I think he found your bone.
Well you said you were lonely out here.
I think you should hold him off while I go for help.
You should see his tweets.
I told you obedience school was worth it.
Sometimes you have to share pee spots
Do you see something, boy?
This is what rampant inflation looks like
The sun is down, another politician is up.
Is this that uncle you’ve been telling me about?
So much for the 'Monster Free Zone' signage.
Don’t hold back on the emotional support.
Bark louder, and this time, more teeth.
Now Stuart, what is Satan trying to tell us?
He just wants to be friends.
I know, he shouldn't be off leash.
Remember, it's not the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog.
It's wagging, so that's a good sign.
...And that is why dogs should stay off drugs.
OK, Albert, time to go pee-pee.
Be friendly, Molly.  No need to frighten him.
I warned you about pooping in his yard.
You just had to sniff the pee over here, didn’t you?
You actually prefer this to the vacuum cleaner?
Ruff , don't hurt the big dog
Don't worry it's just swamp gas.
You just had to pee here, didn’t ya boy?
Do you remember the password?
He's more afraid of you than you are of him
Can you at least pretend like it's the mailman?
He's actually a pretty mediocre dentist most of the time
And I thought buying a dog would help me meet women... I'm going to give Tinder another shot.
um, the small dog area isn't here anymore
Stay, I'll get help!
Fido, be nice and say hello to my former science teacher.
What part of fearless protection of your master don’t you get?
See, this is what happens when you aren’t properly socialized.
Don't be afraid, he's just one of the candidates for President.
We had trolls back in my day.
Don’t worry, you’re still man’s best friend.
Now would be a good time to roll over and play dead.
You’ve got a great imagination for a dog.
Well, at least it's out of the closet.
The tail wag is not helping.
Thanks, Kary Mullis, now everyone's fooling around with CRISPR.
It's all right, Sparky; I'm pretty sure it just wants to sniff your butt.
It's okay, he's after the unfettered capitalism that led to the deforestation of his home.
He can't bark himself,so he eats little dogs that yap.
Please just decide to join him or not so we can go back inside.
That's just Grandma before she's had her coffee.
Go outside, they said. Fresh air will be good for you, they said.
You can take him. Think big.
We're late for our play date
Well boy, looks like you got Catfished again.
We went out of our way to reunite you with your Master, Mr. Trump!
Yes, I said sic 'em.
You have been trolled.
He's such a drama queen.
I know you've always been curious about your birth parents.
Something tells me he doesn’t care if you’re wagging your tail .
Yeah buddy, I think we walked really far from home, like, really far.
Ugh. I hate when owners let their dogs off-leash.
You had to pee on that stump.
You see?  This is why we have  leash laws.
You'd think at this point the Government would take water table pollution more seriously, but we know it's all about the money, don't we Spot?
Can I borrow your poop scoop?”
You realize you two share 99.7% of the same DNA?
You don't see him barking at the mailman, do you?
He says he's made a bit of a mess and wants to know whether you've a spare poop bag
You are still not getting it Chester, when you spot your prey you are supposed to stand on 3 legs ant point your tail
It's not a competition.  But if it were,you would lose.
That is the worst case of PMS I've ever seen.
I'm sorry, but I warned you. If you don't go, I'd get something to scare it out of you.
What are you waiting for? Show it who's boss!
Is this Grendel, or his dam?
You're the one who took the test so you could meet your relatives.
I hope your bite is better than your bark.
Yes, I ‘m sure he’s friendly.
Shouldn't you be trying to protect me by now?
One day you'll be big and fierce too.
See what happens when you don't go to obedience class, Spot?
Watch this.
I think it's probably just the pepperoni pizza I ate, but what do you see?
Silly me! When the weatherman said it was beastly outside, I assumed he meant the temperature.
I don’t think Timmy’s in the well anymore Lassie
Where’s the tough guy now?
Don't worry, it only eats cats.
You're the one who was begging for a walk.
Sick him Fido!  I'm out of here!
Why can't you be like your big brother?
No problem, just remind him that you two are genetically connected.
What are you upset about? I gotta walk back to the house alone.
Don't worry.  He's vegan, not paleo
This is the part where you are supposed to bark.
Careful boy, that may be our next President.
Don't let Mr. Baskervilles' appearance put you off.  His kennel's Yelp reviews are excellent.
Bet he’ll howl if you do.
Go for the ankles, Rex!
Scary? Yes, but its breath is a weapon of mass destruction.
Walk the dog in the valley, see the Sasquatch," she says. 
She doesn't know the difference between a Sasquatch
and a Werewolf?
Don't worry, I've heard they are vegetarians.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself...
and werewolves.
I'd heard that his species had gone extinct. He must be the last one.
Yes, sir - this is the dog who chewed up my new shoes.
She's a bit long in the tooth for you, don't you think?
It's just tired old Bigfoot. Give him a thrill and bark.
I hope he’s wearing a chip.
See what you could be if you applied yourself?
Another example of climate change. Let me introduce you to Pooch your ancestor.
Trust me. This is only virtual reality, I think?
If you don't stop barking at night, he'll come and get you.
That's why I told you not to
tinkle along the Black lagoon
I suppose yelling "Sic 'em" is pointless.
YOU were the one who wanted to go outside.
I wouldn’t “say hello” to this one boy.
Toto, we're back in black and white, so I have a feeling we’re not in Oz anymore.
I'll never complain about having to clean up after you again.
You failed to mention that Rebecca would be joining us.
And me without my camera.
Hard to believe you’re both descended from wolves.
Go sniff his butt and make friends.
This is the last time I'm letting you lead.
I could totally answer this riddle if I had my phone with me.
Not our fight, kiddo.
Try to convince him you're related on your mother's side.
Actually, the full moon was a couple of days ago. It's a waning gibbous now.
Damn, Fido, you bark at the moon and NOW you're quiet!
I guess I had to 'go' too...
Is he friendly?
Oh, hell.
You just couldn't wait until morning when he goes back to hell?!
If you’re good, I’m good.
It's just our President in disguise.
Mom just missed dinner, give her an hour or so.
Being a good boy is a risk-reward concept.
Luke, is that your father?
I hoped that the nightmares from the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm were over.  Sorry.
Snoopers, I've a feeling we're not in London anymore. We must be over Baskerville Hall!
Back, Bruno! Back!
This is the last time we’re attending your family reunions.
I said...attack!
He's basically a squirrel, but bigger.
And you thought it was a rabbit? Now what
OK Big Guy.  You're on!
Ok buddy, go ahead and poop now.
Don't worry, I'm sure his bark is worse than his bite.
S'ok, he's vegan
And that's why we need a border wall.
Don't worry. You were descended from wolves, not werewolves.
What do you mean you’re going on a paleo diet?
You don't recognize our mailman?
"Here's your chance to be a bad doggie.
If it says “give paw!”, don’t.
If you want some dinner tonight you'll protect me.
Amazing, isn't it, what someone can do with a chainsaw.
Well, that's two of us that need to do our business now.
Yeah, this might even make me poop on the floor when we get home.
Ancestry.com? Way to go Fido.
THIS is not what scares me.
You sit. I run!
You just had to go on Ancestry.com, didn't you?
You’re right: hell hath no fury like a wolfman scorned.
It's only for the weekend.
No, YOU hold him off and I'll go for help.
Leave it, it's just political satire."
He doesn’t want to play, Jake.
OK your friend can come too. But he's picking up his own pooh
I thought this was an on-leash park.
I told you not to howl at the full moon.
It's a moon thing.  Mommy will be better tomorrow.
I guess that’s the last time you’ll be eating Daddy’s hallucinogens, eh, Buddy?
I was afraid I'd die in a workplace shooting, so there's that...
I don’t know about you but I’m ready to pee.
well at least bark !!
You see?  Leash laws aren't so barbaric.
If it makes you feel better, my dad’s a Republican.
Not even a 'woof'?
Didn’t I tell you to stop howling?
Protect boy! Protect!
This happens to politicians every two years
You're gonna need a bigger bark.
Walking the dog will be good for you she says.
'Don't worry, he's Russian and he's fake.'
Piddling doesn't help.
Still... no poop!
I guess the moon is real.
What’d I tell you? They never look like their photos.
Don't be scared...He's probably more afraid of you than you are of him.
Are you gonna pee or what?
It's one of those designer breeds.
Now, don’t disappoint me.
What did I tell you about barking up the wrong tree?
Ohh, now you decide not to bark.
You'll remember I said 'go' some time ago.
One of us is hallucinating.  Is i me or you?
He thinks he's a chihuahua.
Guess we shouldn't have taken the short way home.
I warned you not to drink out of the toilet.
No, its not your mother-in-law!
The one time I decide to walk you...Your mother is going to be furious.
Don't be a sissy: He is more afraid of you than you of him!
Go on, see if he's fixed.
Well, here's your chance to prove your loyalty to man.
He'll be training you from now on.
THIS is why I want you to use the wee-wee pad at night,okay?
I wish you were taller.
They were cannabis treats not canine treats.
This time, good boy barks!
I’ll get you my pretty, and your best friend too.
I thought you said you marked your territory.
I think he's saying, "Dogs will not replace us".
Here we have a classic example of Ginsberg's inspiration,a product of destructive social isolation elevated into a mythical figure.
So, like the ad said, he is house-trained and great with kids. He does shed a lot so keep that in mind.
I knew reading you Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was a bad idea.
Imagine the size of those Doggy Bags.
I don’t think sniffing his butt would be a good idea.
If you're really my best friend, why are you thinking all you have to do is outrun me?
have a nice day
Now how did we agree to behave when we saw the Beast from Hell again?
Next time you invite a friend over, you HAVE to make sure it's not a full moon!
Spot, I strongly suggest you don't go with the traditional butt sniff greeting.
Just because Mom and I aren't living together anymore, doesn't mean we love you any less.
You should be more exited Chloe. It's both another person and another dog!
Now's a good time for those emotional support skills.
Now, you're telling me you can't bark!?
Uncle Vern was kind of the black sheep of the family. I mean, wolf."
Obviously he has no regard for the home owner association leash laws.
OK mans best friend, now would be a good time to prove it."
You had to put “taller than 6 feet” and the tongue emoji on your profile, didn’t you?
I told you not to piss on his lawn..
I told you to verify his profile before meeting him
It’s just the looming recession rearing its ugly head.... but they say we don’t have to worry for now!
One of us is in the wrong dog park.
I warned you about getting your DNA results.
You just had to go for a walk in the woods.
If you fight,I fight with you.
What do you mean you don't have to go anymore?
Rusty, things are about to get real.
I don't think growling is going to work this time.
Great. NOW you puddle.
You're right, we should have gone to Universal Studios
They told him that if he saw a dog to pretend to be big and  growl
If your dog keeps following me , I'm reporting him to  Animal Control !
well technically yes, but that was millions of years ago
I told you we should've stayed in the 'small dogs' section.
Who fed Trump after midnight?
Must we go through this whole routine every morning?
If he wants to, I'd let him sniff.
I always believed you. 
Now can we turn back before we both become midnight snacks?
I told you a blind date was a bad idea.
Let’s not allow it to spoil our quality time together.
Just do your business and let's go home. There's nothing out there.
See what could happen if you don't obey your master?
You were the one who wanted walkies!
This is what happens when good boys pee on the carpet.
That's what happens when we don't pick it up.
Does he look like he wants a snack or a meal?
Well, it's a full moon Charlie, what did you expect?
Never mind what he is. What are you? Chicken?”
Yes, Muffin, traditionally dogs were kept specifically to protect their masters.  Do you have any clever ideas?
That's what happens if you only eat your treats.
Yes, I did tell him to go to hell!
I think we'll skip the Chernobyl kibble for Buddy next time.
He’s like this because he goes out only once in a blue moon!
Sure. Now you stop barking!
This is what happens when you guys don't get fixed.
You can stop barking any time now, Rocky.
Now you know how I feel when they say ‘dog’s best friend.’
Well, at least he didn't bring that three headed 'Cerberus' with him this week.
It's okay, boy.  He's only computer-generated.  Like in The Avengers.
ATTACK - Rex!
No, it is not your Knuffle Bunny. Can we go home now?
Don't worry, boy. He won't be re-elected.

Charlie McBride
Santa Barbara, CA
See what howling at the moon will get you?
I can’t blame you buddy, I think that would make me arfless, too.
Sir, Maxxie says you need mint bones before you breathe around the ladies.
I see him in your nighttime future if your house training doesn’t improve!
I think you peed on his changing room.
Great, why does every weirdo want to talk to you when you're out walking your dog?
Hurry take the damn thing.
NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM FOR A PLAYDATE.
C’mon Gus, there’s no such thing as a devil dog.
You gotta be kidding.
Well, you don't expect ME to sniff his butt, do you?
Go ahead.  Sniff his butt and make friends.
Now do you have to go potty?
You should see him at night.
The good news is that you’re only distantly related. That’s also kind of the bad news.
No? What Do You Mean, “No”?
Oh, now you pee.
I already told you the puppies won't be purebred.
And you think I'm scary before I've had my coffee.
Just remember how you clobbered that Bichon Frise.
Don't worry, he is more scared of you than you are of him.
Go easy.  He's bigger than you.
Kill, Teddy, kill!
I think we’ll stick with the bottled water at home.
Don't worry, he can't touch you. You're a GOOD boy.
Hey Chester, if that doesn’t scare the crap out of you, I don’t know what will!
You both share ninety-nine per cent of  the same genes, so do something!
Do you speak werewolf?
No more treats until you take him down.
Full moons, indeed, bring out some ghastly sights.
See what happens if you only eat treats!
So, she doesn't look like her profile picture! Get on with it on tell her it's a no go!
Didn't I warn you about those DNA ancestry promotions with 23andMe ?
On Three........
Karen, I thought you said he was Impeached
Okay, now think of it as a cat
Do you see it too?
Looks like someone hasn't heard of leash laws...
From the depths of your girded primal loins came an "arf?"
I don't think he wants you to sniff his ass.
He takes baaaaad dogs for walks
We have the same nightmare?
Do you think he'll roll over?
See, he didn’t obey when his owner said “Don’t eat that.”
We've been watching too many episodes of "Stranger Things".
Hi Would you like to play?
He wasn’t neutered.
See? Now,will you tell Pam there's a monster waiting in the dark to swallow me alive?
No, Bentley, I don't think it's a good idea to mark your territory now.
You can be a nightmare too, you know.
No Fido, I don't think that's a Great Dane.
Well, there goes the neighborhood.
I’m deleting your mammalsonly.com account.
Please clean up after your owner
Damn!  I was going to get you spayed this week.
Attack, Spot! Attack!
Would you like to reconsider?
Oh, now you don’t bark?
Man Up, Bruno
Stay, Roscoe. This bark doesn't deserve a response.
The moors,” you said. “It'll be fun,” you said
No. You cannot pee on it.
Now you can see what happens when you eat human food.
Yes, when you grow up.
Don’t even start. He’s just trolling you.
Say hello to your Uncle Don, it’s his time of the month.
This is what happens if you bite someone.
See any resemblance?
At least bark
I'm really a lot of fun once you get to know me.
Okay, I am going to ask you one last time.  Where is my slipper?
Shoot! I forgot a bag.
I need to take a dump....
He's a real pussy cat.  It's just the full moon.
Tina reared her ugly head on finding that Paul's affections for the dog surpassed his regard for her
Well Rex, you can thank me now for investing in the flea, tick and werewolf collar...
We should have brought your pedi-paw for those nails.
Try barking again.
Now you know, the earth the angry, very angry.
Don't worry. It's a figment of my imagination.
Remember, it's not the size of the dog in the fight that matters.
Don't get so bent out of shape. I'll pick up after my dog.
No we can’t arrange a play date.
just treat him as a fire hydrant-with a grumpy attitude
This is your brain on drugs.
I’ve seen Stranger Things. Time to R.U.N. , Belle!
mailman-no, him-yes
You wouldn’t happen to have a pooper scooper for me now, would ya?
We all have skeletons in our closets.
Don’t be scared boy, just remember... werewolves rock
Remind me to post this on NextDoor when we get home.
Why can't you be more like your brother?
Are you still feeling protective of me?
Remember what I taught you -- It's just a drug... Calmly observe your experience in the moment and ride it out.
Try the next tree. This one's been over fertilized.
At least it's not Big Foot.
You really must stop baying at the Moon!
You seemed real tough when you were barking at the neighbor's cat.
These Instagram dog models are setting some really unrealistic body expectations
Drama
See. This is what happens when you howl at the moon.
The sign clearly says, “All hellspawn must be on a leash.”
Ignore him, Skip. It the Smiths’ little cat puffing itself up
We all have relatives.
Act big!
Oh grr?  Oh grr?  Good dog, I’m saved.
We came all this way and you’re not even going to sniff his butt?
I am going to count to three ,
and if you are still here ,
I am going to run (as fast asI can)...
You got this. This is what we've been training for.
Sorry Peaches.... I think he is in heat.
No, not here.
This is why I don't take you to the leash-free dog parks
Ah, LSD flashbacks are getting better & better
You've made your point. I am not humping Mrs. Lewis again
Second thoughts about the designated dog park?
He used to be my Uber driver but now he walks dogs.
Arf, arf.....My name is “Baxter”. Go in peace.
Attack!
If you would only go to the bathroom like other dogs,
I wouldn't have to scare the crap out of you.
No worries, Rascal, he's just one of those blow-up baby bully balloons.
Don't worry,, Daphny Dog. He's just a cartoon monster.
OK, now is the time for payback for all those belly rubs.
Spot, go show him who’s boss!
Designer dogs are all the rage!
Stay calm and let him sniff.
And this is where your training should kick in.
Clearly some form of canine. That's your department.
Time for your to earn your kibble.
How come you know he doesn't exist but we humans believe?
It’s not a werewolf and we’re not in London.
I told you not to shit on the carpet again! 
Now say hello to your new owner.
Someone's going to need a bigger poop bag.
The script says to defend your master.
Ya know, your related
Bad dog! Maybe now you'll stop pooping on the neighbor's lawn.
I don't know what he's so happy about either.
Fido. I am your father.
Oh, give him a break.  You know how you get during a full moon.
And you call yourself an animal?
what did I say about not looking at werewolves in the eyes.
I knew it! I never should have taken the path less traveled by.
This is not one of those ‘sniff the butt’  situations.
That’s why your food is hormone free.
Yes Doug, I'm a werewolf. This is awkward but could you spare an extra poop baggie? You know how the neighborhood is...
Does he look Vegan?
I don’t recall Google Maps saying THIS was here.
Let it go, honey. He's not going to pick up his poop.
I told you you were barking up the wrong tree.
Just don't ask for any wishes.
This is not funny!
No, You sic him
Im sure his bark is much stronger than his bite.
Okay, Bud, time to impress.
Just another fake news image.
Why don't you mark this as your spot?
Fido, did you get into my edibles again?
Yep, that's the monster who loves to eat barking dogs.
Don’t worry. He’s all bite, no bark.
Relax. It's only a phantom. His second term isn't real yet.
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
I warned you that pedigree DNA testing could bring surprises.
Where is the border patrol when you need them?
Yes, Toto,   We’re still in Jersey.
I told you not to mark this place
Guess what? Sasquatch has DNA like yours, not mine.
He's just like you, except economically anxious.
See what happens when you just apply yourself?
I warned you something bad would happen if you kept chewing my slippers.
They said that this was a dog park. I'm leaving a zero-star review.
Don't worry, boy. He's easily defeated if we all just vote....
Over the river and through the woods... and did we really not expect this?
I only pick yours up.
Sure, you're scared now but if you want real terror we'll put Fox News on tonight when they're interviewing trump
He has a some what Devil-may-care attitude, don't you think?
He wants you to be is therapy dog
I would suggest not sniffing his butt
I thought you were supposed to be a babe magnet.
I’m gonna go out a limb here and guess you don’t have a silver bullet.
Toto, calm down! . It's really just that man behind the curtain again.
You know, this tweeting thing is getting awfully old.
that one's off the leash.
Now'd be a good time to demonstrate that "man's best friend" thing.
We warned Rex about the evils of steroids.
Hey, Spot, isn't that your uncle twice-removed?
You think this is scary, the Amazons are burning
You just couldn’t hold it in, could you?
Bonnie, this why I don’t feed you scraps from the table.
Well I 'spose we should find another place for you to do your business.
I think we're developing fright fatique.
I was content watching football.
He’s got that Big Dick Energy
Now that's a watchdog.
Payback time for all that premium kibble, Charlie.
I should have brought two plastic bags.
I suppose I won't bother suggesting that you sic it."
Hi dad.  I brought lunch.
This is why we never feed you after midnight, Gerald.
This looks to be a good time to turn around and go home.
I think you should pass on this one
See?  This kennel has other doggies for you to play with.
I take it this is not the dog park you wanted to go to?
We know the moon is our problem.
Do you know him?
He seems to know you.
See? This is what happens when you eat chocolate.
I 'm not scooping that.
Yet the mailman can never sneak by.
That’s what you get for howling at the moon!
No, your coat is much nicer.
No, Toby, I don't think he wants to give you a belly rub.
I don't think being "cute" will help, so can you please growl?
... and this is why I wanted a cat.
Damn it, Milo! you and your darned obsession with alpha males.
You sure you're ready for this dog park?
Don’t worry, that’s just George.  He gets like this every full moon.
No more listening to Lou Reed, okay?
Still want to know about you ancestry?
Luther, I said, "It's like we're wolves", you get so literal.
Start with a friendly butt sniffing, 
then invite him to the dog park next weekend.
The neighbors' cat -- now that's scary.
There's nothing to fear from recession. It's fake news.
Shouldn't you be barking or something? Wait — shit, how much of that CBD tincture did I give you? This is one hell of a way to find out that shit works.
I always wondered where gargoyles vacationed...
Don't worry, I'm sure his bark is worse than his bite.

Sorry Fritz, but I have to report your buddy Gargoyle for being off leash again.
He’s probably at Bedminster.
Every Full Moon It's The Same Dance Routine
Don't worry, Lucky.  I'm sure his bark is worse than his bite.
No, you can not invite him home for dinner.
I'm quite certain he doesn't want to sniff your behind.
My owner says I’m related to wolves, but I really can’t see the resemblance.
Now do you see why I won't let you hang out with your feral friends? THAT used to be Sparky!
It's not funny.
Maybe THIS will help you do your business.
This is what you dragged me out of the cabin for?
I'd suggest skipping your "I was here mark",on either one.
Ok Ralph,  now I understand why you don’t like to come to the dog park anymore.
See, Duke?  This is what happens when you don't learn to socialize at the dog park.
You just had to go for a walk *tonight* didn’t you?
I hate it when other owners don't use a leash.
I'd be scared if I weren't here with you, Brendan.
STILL think meeting your birth mother was a good idea?
I thought this was a dog park
So, those were your nibble marks on my edibles.
His bark is not worse than his bite.
It's either a manifestation of our deepest fears about the inadequacies of the Democratic ticket. Or, Daddy needs to go back on his Wellbutrin." --Leo Sacks, Sunnyside, N
I knew we shouldn’t have eaten those mushroons.
I think I need to pee too.
You go nuts whenever you see a squirrel, but for this: nothing?
Now would be a good time to remember your 'Attack training'.
Please don't lift your leg on his log.
I have a bad feeling his bite may be worse than his bark....
Sniffing his butt is going to make all of us uncomfortable.
Aren't you glad I came along to this Tinder meet-up?
I know he's family but I'm not feeling very welcome....
Well, go on. Give him a sniff.
Still wish you were never adopted?
My Id got loose again.
I don't care what you rolled, it's not Dungeons and Dogs.
Whaddya say we run the hell out of here?
Well, what are you waiting for?
If you pee on his leg it might make him melt.
Your relative?
He's talking to you, Fifi.
Henry, you keep him occupied and I'll jog over to the car.
See Scruffy, this is what happens when you watch Teen Wolf
I don't think he'll respond to "Sit."
So this is your Uncle Floyd?
Now is not the time to act like a show dog!
_You_ answered. Now you're having second thoughts?
We just have to hope he’s up to date on his shots.
Relax. It’s just the FX door switch robot.
You don't even know what a truffle is, do you?
When he surprised your grandma,flashes of light came from her eyes and turned him to stone.
He knows the rules, No leash No walkies
You're conjuring again.
I think he just wants to sniff your butt.
Sic ’em, Rusty!
Why don’t you leave the whimpering to me?
Australian Devil-doodle?
Another reason leash laws are unfair.
See? That is what happens when you go off-leash.
Why do you always have to admire the statue before peeing on it?
I knew you wouldn't recognize him.
I hope you kept the receipt!
We should Run
Looks like Somebody finally won their first court case.
I guess they hired this 
guy and saved billions on the wall, Sparky.
That's what you looked like three million years ago.
The New Normal...
The lengths people go to keep dogs off their lawn
See Billy,THIS is why you should get neutered.
Don't worry. Legend has it he prefers weiner dogs
Not impressed eh?
I would be scared if I believed in werewolves.
Are you looking for Donald Trump? He's right over there.
It's just Mr. Nelson from next door. He's going through his time of the month again.
Are you sure this is your playdate?
See what happens when you don't mind, Sparky?
Give your mommy a hug, Bonzo.
I'm starting to think those breakfast sausages had gone bad.
You're the one who wanted to do some soul-searching.
I think he just wants to be your friend.
It’s 666 of one, 55.5 dozen of the other
Wait, Greenland is the one with the ice?
Tell him to go away or I'll let you off the leash.
oh that's just an ex of mine
May I introduce you to my Lord and Savior?
She won't look so good to you when it's not her time of the month.
He must have slipped his leash.
Tree branches and dead squirrels were one thing, but this?
Stand your ground and look him in the eyes!
He said “ Yum !
I’m sure I read the results right. The DNA test said he was a 100% match.
Whaddya mean, "At this point I suggest we part company?"
Don't worry, Beelzebub won't bite.
Sic ‘em, Rex.  I’ll run for help.
It happens because of the full moon, sweetie, not because you peed in his garden.
Remember, it's not real if you don't believe it.
Well, it's confirmed- my conscience can still find me even after I lose signal.
So my dog says, “I’ll have what he’s having!”
In this instance,best if your bite is bigger than your bark
I think we're going to need a louder "WOOF"
Don't even think of marking this territory.
Hey, you bark at everything else - what's the problem here?
Oh, so now you'll go pee.
Down Boy.
Why aren't you barking?
Well, I for one don't believe in werewolves.
I bet he doesn’t pee on the rug.
He said he's a cousin.
I told you these "Full Moon" walks were a bad idea.
You know if we get through this it'll make a great story.
I don’t care what he says.  I’m not Richard Nixon!
Now, you stop provoking him.
That’s the last time I let you blow your own dog whistle.
Don't you dare sniff his butt!
Recognize him from Puppy Daycare?
Bark much?
Your father insists you come home.
You didn't tell me your Mother was coming.
Peg, would you stop streaming and call 9-1-1 for Chrissakes.
I bet he’s bad at catching tennis balls in his mouth.
don't bark you might scare him
So you couldn't way until tomorrow...
You are not required to bark.  However, if you would like to bark now, it would be appreciated.
I told you meeting up with lost relatives could be awkward.
So he claws and howls at the full moon, beats his chest and all you can muster is a “whoof” ... great, and they said you would made an adequate guard dog!
I know, it sucks to run into your ex.
Well Mr. Boodles,it's a darn good thing that your master took the precaution of sprinkling us both with gluten.
Picking up after you, Spike, isn't so bad I guess.
See Bosco, this is why I didn't want to order that doggy DNA kit in the first place.
Next time be more careful where you lift your leg.
So now you know why we named you Luke.
Is he your mom or your dad’s side?
You still have to do your business if you want to be told you're a good boy.
Don't' worry. It's just an old fiend.
Your birth dad only shows up when he needs money.
Don’t be shy.
Look, we both agreed to a personal trainer.
...and that's how big Miss Kitty thinks she is.
Go on, give your father a hug.
Remember, size is just a construct.
I should've gone with the pit bull.
You stay here and do your growling thing while I sprint back to the car to consider other options.
You took that basset hound.
Something tells me this is not CGI, Toto.
I don’t suppose “sic ‘em!” is what you want to hear right about now?!
Couldn't hold it until morning, could you?!
Chopper. Sick balls.
Werewolf? There wolf.
Come on Skipper - he's more afraid of us than we are of him.
No, it is not a black Lab.
He's a rescue - terrier is all we know for sure.
I'll get the poop bags out.
Sidney, this is just to show you that I take potty training very seriously.
You just had to ask him what his party trick was.
I clean up after you all the time! The least you could do is return the favour.
This doesn't apply even if you did read Cervantes
Don't worry Fido, it's stuck in a giant walnut.
I didn't bring a big enough bag.
Stay.
He wants to sniff your butt if that's okay with you.
Now do you see why we neutered you?
Okay boy meet your crazy cousin Lon...
Whew. For a moment I thought it was a scientologist.
Don't chase the cat!
Hey boy, have you read Maurice Sendak?
Stay Fluffy. I'll run and get help.
Remember when you were a puppy and I taught you to 'sic em'?
That is NOT my species's ancestor.
I told you that you should have stopped barking.
It’s ok, he’s friendly.
Did you come across those funny mushrooms again?
I 'm going to drop your leash now and dash back to the car to get you a biscuit. You STAY while I do that.
That's the last time I wonder what's down Grimpen Mire Lane?
That's what happens to you if you are not a good dog.
No, your dad had a black spot on his nose.
Did you say “Mommy?”?
He cost me $200 at Petsmart. Make the most of it.
Stop whining we can afford another pet.
You had to meet your biological father?
Hey, you're the one who wanted to go for a walk.
You see what I mean ... this is what happens when you start to walk on two legs.
Well, Spot, I’m thinking maybe we should turn around...
You're the one who didn't 'Fetch'.
Ok, I get it. You can wake up now.
Aw, what a precious little puppy. He's so cute!
That’s a little too obedient, Sparky boy.
Death is not the end.
No. I don't care if you are 15-0.
Oh, now you stop barking?
Don’t bark. All it could do is eat us.
I told you not to call him a "pussy"!
Sure, "Lucky."  After a pedicure and haircut, he'll become your new best friend!
You're more afraid of him than he is of you.
I told you what would happen if you kept pooping there!
Don't stare,Tucker,it's rude.
Why can't you transmogrify like the Henderson's dog?
Don’t you feel like barking now?
Lets cross the street.
No,it's not a werewoof.
Can you speak demon?
Don’t be such a pussy.
You're supposed to protect me, you know.
You remember - it’s just Wolfe, the German Shepard from down
The street.
Wait here.  I'll be right back.
Be nice, let it sniff you.
Guys, don’t run. Buddy is a very friendly little puppy
Gozer here is going to be your coach at Guard Dog camp, Daisy.
I told you not to bark
He won't hurt you. He's running for President.
I've soiled myself but you still can't go?
I told you it wasn't a good idea to howl at the moon. But would you listen? Of course not. You're just like Linda.
I knew your incessant howling would get us in trouble some day.
This is what happens when you stop being a ‘good boy’.
Never meet your heroes
Not another word about Beowulf and the truth of myth!
It's supposed to be a solar eclipse today.
Stay calm, it's just Donny in his true personality suit.
It was YOU who fetched the leash”
Stand, Murphy.
Don't worry. If negative interest rates don't bother us, why should this?
Just another media hoax that will be gone by the next news cycle.
Great, I only brought one poop bag.
This is what happens when you eat my favorite shoes.
Well aren't you going to do something about this?
Whatever you do, don't sniff his butt!
And that’s what happens to dogs who don’t obey their master.
This is exactly why you get only non-GMO kibble!
Now you see what can happen when you cry wolf..
C'mon, Fluffy, this is what we've been training for.
'' STAY FRED !  Do not attack!
This is what dog owners become when their dogs don't behave.
Let's walk on National Debt Trail, you said
Ehh, I saw one online that was twice as big.
Don't worship false dogs.
Menopause is a monster old friend.
I don’t have a doggie bag that big .....
It's just a sculpture
Piper, now’s the time to show me what a good guard dog you are!
I guess you really don’t have to go potty.
Get that look off your face.  I am not lifting you up to smell his butt.
Sparky, I think he just wants to play.
See?  Bad posture.
It’s all an act-he’s a game show host.
this is what happens to disobedient dogs
When you said your grandmother was a savage, this was not what I expected
I told you not to lift your leg on Mr. Mitchell's prized Japanese Maple.
I feel like it's your turn to do the whole rescue thing.
No, the Loch Ness monster has smaller ears.
Kill, Coco, Kill
Do you think he's worth a bark or two ?
I just wish people would obey the leash law.
This is why we have leash laws, Fido.
I'm gonna go dive in this lake and hope it can't swim, wanna come?
I know your feelings are hurt, but we are in the age of diverse  emotional support pets"
They call him Mr. Pretty, and he likes to take puppies for bedtime walks.
I thought you said the Pine Barrens would make for a nice change of pace?
Sorry, Skippy. I didn’t know the mystery island getaway that I won was to Three Mile Island.
I love my pal but I should have brought a husky.
This is your friend that reminds you of me?
I thought you were joking when you said "hey look the big bad wolf"!
I said attack Sparky!
And you call yourself a guard dog?
I think I'm going to need a bigger dog.
So you're not going to sniff his butt?
See, this is what happens when you chew on daddy’s shoes.
This is your lover, boy?
I know what you’re thinking. No, you better not sniff his butt.
I wouldn’t bark at this one I don’t think.
Cousin?
Ok, I’ll let you run free with him for a bit, but no biting.
Meet your uncle Fudd. He likes to beat his feet in the Mississippi mud.
Just bite him in the nuts, that should do it.
Don't be a scaredy-cat.
This is why I wanted to neuter you.
Milo, apologize and tell him you will stop bullying him at school
I bet you can become friends, just go sniff his butt.
So? Where’s that fear aggression now?
I don’t care what Trump says.  It’s a squirrel.
This is why I  don't want you to bay at the moon too much.
That's just the mailman.
Please don't shit yourself; I forgot the poop bags.
I know Sparky, I hate cats too.
Sometimes you just have to get back on the horse, my friend.
Looks like this confirms your suspicions about her!
You're the one that just HAD to have a walk on full moon night...you figure it out!
Don't you even think about it!
Sweetheart, you’re not you when you’re hungry
Distant relative, right ?
Just don't wag your tail.
This is no where to woof.
Fluffy Do you know this guy?
The full moon will make for a beautiful walk, you said...
You sniff his butt to distract him while I get the leash on.
I can remember when a simple 'No dogs allowed' would suffice.
Sic ‘em Pumpkin
Just remember, it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog that matters.
Yup, an American werewolf in Greenland.
I’d rather he sniff your butt.
And that is why they call it Devils Lake.
I am your father,Luke
Sic him, Wolf.
We talked about this. You're a dog now, not a puppy.
There is no Santa Claus 
There is no Easter Bunny, and
There are no such things as ghosts
Don't be shy, Fido, that's just our neighbor Tim during his time of the month
And this exhibit shows the urban werewolf, full moon phase.
Hmmm..when was your last rabies vaccine?
We may both be their descendants.
Stay away from the werestrays.
Don't worry. He won't hurt us - he's running for office.
I don't care if she is in heat.
Say hello to the friendly man.
Well? What happened to the leash aggression?
Say hi to your new brother. He's also a Rescue.
Say “woof”
Yeah, pretty good. Yourself?
This is what happens to bad little dogs who don't heel.
Mrs Murray really should get her dog spayed
Find me a female on-line, you said. I want to breed, you said. It'll be quick and easy, you said.
No offence, but we really should have gone with the Rottweiler.
I guess I should have gotten a Rottweiler.
Yeah, your brother didn’t think much about wearing his cone either.
Why should I be afraid? He's fake news.
Sorry Rex, but you gotta take one for the team!
This doesn’t mean that you get to go off leash.
Don’t worry — the President assures us that he could be a decent one.
I should have named you David instead of Goliath.
Napoleon, I've told you before-- stop projecting.
If it’s brown, avert your eyes and lay down; if it’s black make yourself big and fight back...or is it the other way around?
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
I don’t think he’s going to throw you a stick.
We're gonna need a bigger poop bag!
That's really great boy. No really, the other doggies only find  dead birds and old boots.But you Fido, you always up the ante."
This has got to be the terror in the White House my dad is always talking about.  I'm no human but I understand fear!
Remember I taught you about David and Goliath?

No I don't remember what happened to adavid
He’ll be fine in the morning.
It's either heel, or heal. Your choice.
Why do you only change when you hear the doorbell?
He's only like this 3 nights a month.  The rest of the time he's a morally conflicted existentialist!
And you wanted to go for a walk...
Sorry, the person who usually scares the crap out of you called in sick, so I had to hire someone from Congress.
Listen to me, it's not all glamour and moonlight! Every month I have to buy a new set of clothes because I forgot there was a full moon, the blood and gore ain't so hot either. Just listen to your Master and you'll be fine.
I  bet this nightmare has a connection to AR15s, opioids, tariffs, losing health care,  no retirement saving, increasing government debt, mass shootings, gutless congressmen, corporate egress ,narcissistic leaders and people who vote for them.
I don’t care that she hasn’t shaved. It’s just that on her Hinge profile she looked way skinnier.
Next time you try to set me up with one of your friends, show me a picture first."
I know he doesn't look like Mr. Jones from next door, but I'm telling you he's just having an off night.
Yes, based on your DNA results, this is your great-great-great-great-grandfather.
It's possible, Rufus, that the Moonlight Maniac isn't quite as mythical as we may have hoped.
This is the anointed one?
He doesn't like to be bothered, while he is doing his business.
Larry, ATTACK!
Sure you lead me right to this, but you hide when the waffle iron beeps.
Fake news  and loser media would have you believe there's a monster about to pounce.
Before I’m torn apart, I just want to say that it would be funny if you called yourself “Society” because people would be like “the real monster is society” and you’d be like “Yeah, that’s me!” Just think about it, I dunno, could be cool.
Now, can we go?
It’s just my Avatar.
See what you've created by peeing on our neighbor's flowers!
Don't listen to him.
Remember life before you were neutered?
In this situation, for example, barking wouldn't do much good.
Climate change skeptics can be frightening but we’ll probably die from a nuclear accident.
We're not in Yorba Linda anymore, Checkers.
According to Fox News, we've nothing to worry about. So, just ignore him.
I suppose “fetch” is out of the question.
See, this is what happens when the neighbors let their cat outside during a full moon
Hope you brought bags this time.
Don't show fear!
You still don’t have to go?
I warned you about online howling.
Attack Fido!
Wanna’ play?
If you want to take him home, your the one that has to feed him.
And that's what happens if you don't take your medicine.
Sure am glad we listened to Bob Barker
Don't worry, Spike. Even spooky hell demons have a soft spot for puppies.
Remember when I said we could do the house-training the easy way or the hard way
I see you brought lunch.
Why don’t they ever look like they have photos online?
Promise me that you won't be like this when you're older...
What kind of bone did you bury here?
I suppose you want me to pay for your cousin's dog food this week?
Let this be a lesson. This is Wolfy, my last pet. He'll never crap on the living room carpet again.
He was a bad doggie
What would Rin Tin Tin do in this situation?
You're supposed to be a therapy dog - get to work.
This is the girl you wanted me to meet??
See how bold and confident he is? Maybe you can start by not hiding under the bed every time the doorbell rings.
This is what I had in mind when we got you.
You're channeling your inner alpha again, aren't you?
Herewolf
I bet you will play dead now
It seems more social than the neighbor’s cat.
It’s what we call an arranged marriage
man's best friend...sure
Don’t be afraid, there’s a new anti-bullying ordinance.
It's more dog than man, so you deal with it.
Mom?
Go ahead. It's important you learn socialisation.
This is when you’re supposed to bark.
How come your not scared ?
Can I change my mind about the cat?
Well this is embarrassing. Steven, meet my ex, Michael. 

Michael, Steven.
This is what happens if you don't take your heart-worm pill.
"Oh crap! He's asking for my vote."
I bet his daddy forgot his leash.”
You're playing Pokémon Go, aren't you?
Remember, you're both descended from wolves... it'll be an even fight.
It's  a new chewy
Wanna wait and see if he leaves anything for you?
It's a dog eat dog world. But don't worry, Daisy. That's not a dog.
In retrospect, the bark collar was ill-conceived.
Woof, woof, indeed!
Remember.  Stay off ancestry.com.
It’s not the size of the d- oh who am I kidding!
Rex, don’t hurt him.
I think I need a bigger dog.
No, the book said 'descended from wolves' not from Beowulf.
Who’s a good dog?
No, I don't think it wants to sniff.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Go say Hi.
Not your Mother’s walkies, is it?
Ziggy, sometimes I wish I knew what you’re barking at.
This is what you could’ve  been like if I hadn’t raised you.
Okay,Spot,I'll just mosey over to those trees.  Let me know if you need any help.
This will be you if you keep spitting out your flea and tick medication.
To be fair, for the rest of the month he's vegan.
And, no, Fido, you can't pee here.
I don't care how closely related you are we're not adopting him.
Why are you always barking at things that aren't there?
Rex, meet my other best friend.
You see that, Milo?
That's why we give you non-gmo treats.
Now I KNOW I’m not in Kansas anymore.
Do you think what i think?
You keep it occupied while I go for help.
Com'on already. Do you feel like it now?
``Whaddya say, bark or no bark?''
Damn I forgot the treats!
It's okay Rover. I've checked your DNA and he's an ancestor.
Well, if it's meat, I'll trade you for two tennis balls and a frisbee.
Excuse me,sir, do you have an extra poop baggie?
Maybe go smell its butt?
Do something.
Remember the conversation about table scraps?
Are you up to it?
This is where you do that 'morphing into a grizzly bear' thing we talked about.
Couldn’t  you bark, at least?
If you insist on smelling its butt, don't come crying to me.
You dragged me here to see this???
It's Mittens our kitten, all grown up.
I told you those weren't Shiitake mushrooms!
Go ahead big shot! Give me that same fierce bark you let out when the neighbor’s cat comes into our yard!
See what happens when you don't eat your vegetables?
Yes, that’s how I feel towards the president. What’s it to you?
They're not as scary as they look, and I've heard they eat their weight in ticks every day.
Bite me.
He wants half of the $73 billion Americans spend on their pets each year and he will let you live.
It’s just a meme.
I don't suppose you've seen any lady monsters around here?
Not to worry--just one of the Hillary 2020 advance people.
See, it could have been worse.
welp, that's the last time I poop under a full moon
Next time you follow me!
This is why we call mommy Alpha
Honey, that developer is back.
I said "mind the water level", not "find the devil".
Rex, I think I heard a tree limb snap!
Don't hurt him too bad...
Pee on my carpet again, and this is your new roommate
That's me the next time you do doo my floor.
You were the runt of the litter.
No. I said HEEL.
Wildcrafted probiotics should come with a warning label

Eh, do you reckon his bark is worse than his bite?
The show's over, let it go
See, this is what happens with the premium dog food..
Do You Still want to "do your business"
Time to try you off-leash.
No more walks after midnight.
Why don’t you tell him you’re related to him?
Another fine mess you've walked us into.
Nothing ?
.. the difference is, my master doesn't take me on walkies.
No barks!
DNA doesn’t lie.
It's hard to give you up but you'll prefer it here upstate.
You see? Domestication's not so bad now, is it?
It could be your mushroom sniffing days may be numbered.
See...  too much Science Diet CAN have adverse effects.”
There's not a bag big enough to clean up after that!
Even Sasquatch has been emboldened by Washington rhetoric.
OK, not more full moon walks.
Forgetting the poop scoop seems so prophetic yet de minimis right now"
He's just exhibiting fear aggression.
Why did you have to bite the mailman?
No, you can’t sniff its butt.
This is really just some bro who's had too much moon.
They never look as their online profile
Did you bring a poop-bag?
Unlike you, I am sure he is potty trained.
Max, it's only an illusion.
No, we won't start referring to you as loupgar-Buddy.
Meet your alter-ego, buddy.
Don't raise a back leg and you'll be fine.
Take him seriously, not literally.
That’s why you get gluten free food.
There are some things I’m just not willing to bark at.
No, he's too big to be a Bear and Wooly Mammoths walk on all four.
I told you not to marry a dog who never let you see her without her make-up...
Is that your inner beast or mine?
Wonder what kibble he's eating?
I suppose you'd like to smell his crotch.
Welp, here is the Devil you know.
I don't think he wants to play fetch.
This is the new playmate you wanted me to meet?
See what happens when you're not a good dog?
This is your uncle Bert.
Don't worry, my wife isn't always like this.
It's just that time of the month.
This time it is the size of the dog in the fight.
Well, Little Sacrifice, here is where we part ways.
Normally, I am a fan of mixed breeds, but there's a limit
This is why I keep you on a leash.
Ariel, stop your conjuring and give Caliban a rest.
Now we know what happens to doggies who don’t  learn to sit.
Don't worry. He is all bark
Yayo Antioch, CA.
Sorry, Max...I'm afraid I don't know why they didn't keep him on a leash
See! That’s how I found you in the pound.
You picked a hell of a time to get over your excessive barking issue, Rufus.
Can you smell him from here or do you wanna get closer?
Dont worry, I'm just here for David Koch's eternal soul....
Why aren’t you barking now?
This is my wife, Cheryl.  She's a lunatic.
Pooch, I know I said I’d like to meet your alter ego, I just didn’t expect you to introduce him to me tonight!
He will be your new owner if you don't stop peeing on the furniture.
This guy is scared of dogs.
I'm guessing it wouldn't do any good to turn loose the hounds.
He's looking for a lost lab.
You see? This is why we don't get you that "Call of the Wild" food.
Looks like you've got the hang of 'conjuring.' Now let's work on 'play dead.'
That was me before I met you.
You evolved from him.  Protect me!
And if you fail obedience school, here's who will be teaching your remedial class.
See? This is what would happen if  I put the regular canned pumpkin in your food instead of the organic- his coat looks a bit patchy.
Remember, once you sniff the big dog's butt, it's time to go.
Quit whimpering! Growl back and scare it off!
DNA testing indicates he's an ancestor for both of us.
Whaddaya mean, laryngitis?
This is what happens when you eat your poop
That's what happens when you scare the postman
You’re the one who wanted that DNA test
If you STILL won't poop, there's nothing more I can do for you.
See, he’s just moonlighting.
Yeah, this is why I don't like going outside.
Well Silver, can you at least bark?
Believe me he's a push over.
No, I don't see the resemblance.
They really let any breed into the dog park nowadays...
And the fire hydrant wasn't good enough.
He’s got a point — we’ve passed up a lot of good picnic rocks and this one seems fine.
One growl and we're dead.
Don't be scared; I'll protect you.
Now you see why I said you need to go quickly.
Are you up for 15 minutes of fame, old boy?
Whuddya mean...we?
I don’t suppose you’re a guard dog?
Family reunions, am I right?
I know the dog breeders are out of control, that’s why we got you from a rescue.
Can we get a woof-woof?
You may want to keep the sniffing to above the waist.
If he bites us we'll finally be able to play poker together.
Don’t be afraid to pet her. She won’t bite.
I was always told dogs have no idea of perspective; I hope you were always told that!
I believe we finally found your long lost relative.

Steve Moss
I should have made the kids walk the dog.
Dracarys!
This is our neighbor, Mr. Fang.
You peed on his hibiscus...
We're gonna need a bigger bag of kibble.
She must have used an old profile pic.
Max is a local Instagram celebrity.
I thought leash laws were enforced here
Again, Bol’goraak? Even Fido is tiring of this.
Well, you don't just get to be a werewolf by spending 10,000 hours as a dog; they have to be 10,000 hours of focused practice, taking feedback, all that stuff ...
Mom says you shouldn't have gotten into her THC tablets
I should have listened to my wife and gotten an Irish wolfhound.
Hurry up and do your business.
A Democrat, no doubt.
How would you like to follow THAT around with a pooper-scooper?
Sit.  Stay.
My other dog is a Hell-Hound.
Let's mark your territory on the next log.
See what the right amount of protein will get you, Coco?
Come on, do it!
He appears to have had a bad day. Why don't you fetch him some slippers?
Do your Triple-Arf!!! That'll get to him!
Yeah you can pet him, he doesn’t bite.
Get’em Puffy!
He thinks he's people
I think I'm going to need one of those bags we brought.
Don't worry, they play at the dog park all the time....
He'll take you for walks while I'm away.
Don't worry, Sparky.  I used to listen to Jack on WNBC in the 70s.
Yeah, I know.  That’s how I feel about Trump.
For God's sake bark.
Well,don't just stand there,say something!
This is my mother-in-law, just 'before' she turns into something hideous.
Don’t worry, he doesn’t bite.
Yah, well, YOU thought the cat was scary.
Does that look like thunder to you?
Show him who’s boss but don’t hurt him.
Sure, you can pet him.
I suppose naming you Useless was a self fulfilling prophecy.
No, Fido, your cousin may not stay on our couch.
I hope you remember the protect command from your training class.
I,d like to explain domestication to you but it's a tricky subject
Well you're related - do something!
I agree, Calabaza, the hairy giant zucchini is scarier.
Now do you see how much more scary it is to have a bark worse than your bite?
He’s your son too, you know.
I'm sure that is not real, although I did forget to take my meds today.
Just think, the two of you are related... talk to him.
Don't worry. I know how this season ends.
Well we found it, Farley.  Now fetch.
Now you've done it Rex. Cried woof one too many times.
I got you to get over her.
We had a deal, the leash-god for an eternity of belly rubs."
I suspect his bite is worse than his bark!
I knew I shouldn't have let you poop on that guy's lawn.
Do you still want to spend time with your birth parents?
Say trick or treat or my dog will seek you.
You just had to pee, didn't you?
But Trump doesn't like dogs.
You do know of course that this means an angry letter to The Times?
It's time you met your mother....
Now, do you understand why I do not like nature walks?
You couldn’t have picked a place closer to the house?
I warned you but you insisted that we come this way, now I hope he’s allergic to humans but just loves cute puppies.
Sic balls
don’t worry, it’s just another news cycle...
Get a load of this guy, he’s the local mailman!
I've seen a lot of Halloween gags, but this one takes the cake."
OK, don't get so excited, so I forgot to bring a poop bag.
When I bought you, they said a Jack Russell terrier was going to be able to take on a giant spawn of Satan, no problem.
Well I guess you won't be poopin' tonight, Lucy.
Anyone you know, Fido?
trump, antichrist, and the apocalypse all rolled up into one.
And that is the nice caption.
This is my politically correct caption. 
Imagine what I really think.
No worries Duke, that’s a Monstadoodle combining the effectiveness of a watchdog with the hypoallergenic qualities of a poodle.
Alright, you can keep him, but you have to feed him and he can’t sleep in your bed
Don’t be naive. He’s not going to share his Filet Mignon.
It's up to you
This is a good example of something you shouldn't fetch.
Those habaneros get me every time.
I thought you said we were getting a cat.
Go  get 'em, boy!
Voilà! I present to you your real dad. Do you feel better now?
I think he is after you!
Do you think he's house trained?
But can he tweet?
I think we've strayed into flyover country, Orlando.
Bite his ankle while I run to get help!
Answer him, dammit!
At least it's better than the skunk you got into last week.
I told you.  This is what happens when you eat people's trash.
You just couldn't hold it until morning.  Could you?
I don't suppose you'd consider a little box.
I’m glad you’re with me, Silver Bullet.
Go get em,Butch!
Someone's ignoring the leash law.
What would you like to see next?
Rip into him, Porkchop, and tear him to pieces. I’ll go for help.
Do NOT mark your territory here.
He's YOUR relative, not mine.  YOU negotiate.
He must be a rescue.
Play nice with your new brother.
That's why you have to stay away from Moonshine, buddy.
Don't worry, you're not his type.
This is your new Mommy. She gets a bit cranky once a month."
He's a very distant relative.
This is what happens when you drop out of obedience school to become an actor.
You dragged me out here on a full moon night so you could do your business in front of an imaginary ancestor ??
Here's looking at you, kid
Why do these evening strolls always start fine but end up with a witch, vampire or a monster?
I told you not to pee on that gold lantern we found. “
I guess that obedience school is looking a little better now, isnt' it?
Shoulda' picked it up.
I warned you not to trust Sniffr photos.
And I thought my mother-in-law was scary
Don't worry Rover, I know him.  We flushed him down the toilet three years ago.
This would be a good time to remember your training.
I blame you.
No, I'm sorry, we can't take him home
Don't just stand there.  Mark your territory!
We just had to walk on the wild side.
The devil is in the dog-tails.
Don't scare the kitty.
His name was Bigfoot and no one knew him.  Now that there are many environmental changes he wants to be seen as the survivor.
So much for the outdoors.
I ordered a Feast For a Beast, and you brought me a snack?  You know what happens when you disappoint me!
If I let you go you promise to be back by midnight?
I hate to break the fourth wall, but really... what are you going to come up with for this one?
We're just taking a little walk. Don't be startled. Imagine it as a stuffed animal.
That's why you need to be a good boy, Rex. You don't want to end up like the remaining Koch brother.
Be glad you're not a human whose fears can create monsters like this!
Tear his ass up, Misty!
Mans best fiend is what you found!
This is what happens when don't do your business as soon as we get out of the house.
Really? Is that your friend ?
Damned trolls.
Let’s wait for the next tree, Sparky. He has anger issues.”
Dana, I want to meet his family before you go on the doggie play date.
It's man's best fiend.
Stop barking! He becomes a normal dog once the moon sets.
Okay, forget the stick.
Uh o, were you a bad boy?!
'According to quantum physics, it's there or not there at the same time. Your choice.
Problem Going ???    I Can Fix That !!!!!!!!
Bow wow WOW?
Uh-oh, boy.  Looks like Fluffy's in heat again.
I said sic him!
Sic 'em, Fido!
This is his idea of unleashing the beast.
Think you can run faster than me?
I think it's found it's next snack.
"Fido! Sick him!
Ticks everywhere, dude! Better check your little man.
You are on your own.
Bark! Dammit, Bark!
Why are you just standing there?  Aren't you going to sic 'em?
So now you don't bark!
Woof Woof.
That's my other self, just learn to ignore him.
Stand your ground.
Go on - protect me!
Well, if this isn’t what set you off…
Well, what do you think, Todd? You think you can 'take' this one like you 'took' that doberman?
No you know what evil lurks in the heart of the owner of those flowers where you chose to relieve yourself.
Well?    Do something!
I guess it's too late to trade you in for a Rottweiler....
A good walk foiled
He just wants to Pet you I think!
Honey, you’re Dad is really losing it.
We're going to get blamed for that mess he left
Your relatives have been getting on my nerves lately.
And that's why you eat your vegetables.
You said you didn't want to be left at the pound.
I said dance and he danced.  Now, for my second wish, I’ve got something political in mind.
'Hey, I deserve at least a "woof woof"!
What's he saying - Does he need directions?
All right.  Time for you to earn all that free food and health care I've given you for the last eight years.
Look Buddy, someone wants a play date
If you really can talk, speak now
You could try harder.
Who let the dogs out?
I told you my personal demons are bigger.
I hate when my in-law comes to town too!
Don't worry, we're almost at the off-leash park.
Speak, damn it!
I thought maybe you guys could do a podcast together?
No...*I* am your father.
Shaggy and Scooby 2019
Sic 'm, Champ!
Bark, dammit!
These live action kids movies are starting to get a little too real.
OK Bittlesworth, it's go time!
Look, Fido, I have ethnic pride too. See one of my ancestors!
Remember: every downside has an upside.
So this is how it ends!
Another visit from your mother in law?
I think he means you Ruff
It's all for the best, I'm moving into a Pet free building.
No...you are not related!
Yeah, Corky, he’s afraid of puppies.  Go figure.
Even he doesn't jump up on the couch.
Now Fido don't worry,  his bark is worse than his bite.
Make sure you don't pee on his lawn.
...fuck this guy.
Sic 'em, Duke!
I told you I wasn't lazy when I said no night walks.
And you would have been socially prepared if you had gone to the dog park.
Glad I don't have to scoop up after him
So, not such a g'boy after all.
Sometimes, I really question your judgement.
Don't just stand there, do something!
It's a therewolf.
Her name is Caroline. She's your birth mother.
Really?...Nothing?... But when Mrs. Jansen walks Pinky by the house, that needs a ten minute tirade every morning?
I hope you still remember the Kung Fu I spent all that money on.
No, Fido, this is not your long-lost cousin.
When I was a boy this tree was just a little ympe.
Yes, it IS just like looking into your mirror at home.
Now, we need someone to pick up after us BOTH!
You have to face your demons like everyone else.
He was a lot less scary drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
i told you they called it Monster Rock for a reason.
Heel, hound!
What do you mean, you don't know how to dog paddle?
I know, I know! He would make a better President.
The HOA wants to show they’re serious about the leash law.
We really should have done something about global warming.
don't worry.  It's just my ex-wife
Don't be afraid, we visit the White House next!
Where's all that bravado you show to other dogs?
what was the name of your shelter?”
Trump picked me to replace Smokey the Bear, because right now “Only Finland can prevent forest fires.”
Maybe Dior, but definitely not Prada.
C’mon . . . just think of him as a big squirrel
I’m not sure I like the friends you are hanging out with.
Relax, he only comes out when there is a full moon!!
Don’t worry I’m not picking up after him.
But can he howl?
See?  There was nothing to bark about.
Maybe he just wants to play.
“Tell me who you walk with and I’ll tell you who you are.”
Thank you, Herman. You have found your bone. Mine. All of them.
Once again, fooled by the profile pic.
See what happens when you don't behave.
Now look at what you've done. I told you not to howl at the moon!
See what can happen if you eat your vegetables?
He's calling you a pussy, Snoopy!  You gonna that crap?
I don't know what the hell it is. Go sniff its ass.
I'd like you to meet your new brother, Stanley. He's a rescue.
...and here they said this was a good neighborhood!
He owns a corgi during the day.
Yes, I'm upset too that the Government took these off the endangered species list.
You’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all.
Okay, so what's your final form?
Don’t worry, you’re not an emolument.
Well, you said you wanted more adventure in your life.
Yes, this IS why you were neutered.
Rex, this climate change is really starting to get out of hand.
He wouldn't appreciate you. He's only a dog person once a month.
See that Buster?  Some people like to have scaring looking pets but then they do not know how to take care of them.
Relax. He just needs a snicker bar.
We secular humanists have nothing to fear.
It's just an act, he's no more territorial than you.
Can't you just be satisfied with barking up a storm?
Well are you going to go or not?
I bet it would be even scarier if it was in color.
The ones in sheep’s clothing are more worrisome.
He likes dogs and I've heard he has a heart of gold.
Give your grandfather a hug goodbye and we'll go out for kibble.
He's my cousin. And yours.
Now would be the perfect time to channel your inner wolf!
If there were ever a time to start begging...
We're definitely in the wrong place.
I think you’ll
make a good cadaver dog.
Make your move or it's back to dry dog food.
I never dreamt that when he screeched, "Drain the swamp", they'd continually hire FROM it...
Well, are you satisfied with what your howling accomplished?
The only thing we have to fear is hair itself."
Hand shake, JoJo. Show him hand shake"
I thought I told you to stop inviting your cousin.
Still want to meet your dad?
A couple of barks wouldn't hurt."
Bark, George!
You want to take him down, or should I.
Be a nice monster and sit!
Well, don’t just stand there.
That full moon did seem ominous
It’s okay, you were in the placebo group.
I’ve had worse Nightmares.
I think you’ve used your favorite spot one too many times.
Ya' know, you look the way I feel right now
This is precisely why I'm not a cat person!
Here's the plan: you poop, and I'll vomit.
There goes the neighborhood.
I see Trump is back in town.
Sniff his bowels until he howls.
And that’s why you should go to college.
We're never looking at what's right in front of us.
Would you just pee already?  I'm getting cold.
Relax. He's just wagging the dog.
For your own good, you need to face your biggest fear.
Listen to what the president said-what you see and hear isn’t real.
To be 100% clear, this IS a loyalty test.
This still doesn't excuse all that barking.
I told you dating out here would be just as scary as in the city.
Wanna pick a bone with this guy?
Relax boy; he's a figment of my imagination not yours.
He's your daddy, Beagle-Boy!
Looks like we should relax the ‘no begging’ rule.
I'm still your forever Dad.
You're the rescue dog. Sic 'em.
May I remind you that you're man's best friend?
The two hounds of the Baskervilles
What am I supposed to do-scream?
You have GOT to get a restraining order on your ex, buddy.
Something tells me we've missed Camp Bow-Wow.
f I were you, I wouldn't even THINK about sniffing his butt.
You should let me outrun you - it'll be a much easier
lifestyle change for you.
While it's eating you I'm going to run for it.
His bite is bigger than his bark.
Are you ready to go back now?
You never should have gone on Ancestry.com.
This was us before selective breeding.
Don’t fetch
Don't be afraid, he looks like he was related to my ex-wife and she was ten times scarier.
Would you hurry up and take the damn picture already!
You did well with the Loch Ness, give it a shot.
I've seen this episode of Scooby Doo multiple times
Hey Sparky, Remember - I did try to discourage you from meeting your biological parents.
Hard to believe you two share an ancestor.
See? Eat your dog food and be obedient, and you might grow up to be like him some day!
OK, what did you pee on THIS time?
Oh, you could probably take him with one paw tied behind . . .
Daisy, this is Beelzebub. He is the one that I told you about.
Not in the mood for a butt sniff?
OK" Fido, remember what you learned in obedience school?  Now  sick'em
No, Elwood, that's not your tree.
Be grateful. He walks himself with half as many legs.
Remenber our discussions about Freud?
Oh, it’s just Trump trying to intimidate the Fed, again.
We're looking for TRUFFLES, not TROUBLE.
Your mother stopped shaving recently, don’t stare
I'm skeptical that he's your father Luke.
You're not familiar with the expression 'sic 'im?'
She reminds me of Susan too. The smell and monthly temper.
Now...you can bark.
What did you expect, Bambi?!
This is Mr Smith from across the street  - it's a special night for him.
Just take the picture. We’ll figure out the hashtag later.
Like I said Bruiser, he's just a pussycat.
And that Skippy is why when we go to the park you should not let any ol’ dog take advantage of you.
I think I'd be more afraid of a clown
I’m gonna go out on a limb and say he’s not a Bob Seger fan.
After that whole 3 little pig thing.....     Ya I went VEGAN !!!!!!!
Don't you worry, just virtual reality.
Such great fun to chase the mailman everyday. Hope you’re happy, Ginger.
Not to worry--2016 was a fluke.
I can't believe our son is already all grown up and leaving for college
They said "keep to the road" but did you listen?
I think it likes you.
No, Fluffy. I’m not going to deal with were-puppies again.
This is your department.
You see?  We’ve both evolved.
But he can’t sit on command.
The least you can do is start barking.
Now do you appreciate your GMO-free food?
Are you seeing that in black and white too?
So this is the nightmare that had you barking in your sleep?
Easy Fluffy, he only wants our souls.
This is what carbs do to you
No, you can't take him home..
Don’t worry, it’s election season.
Watch Spot, next he's going to jump up on that stump and shout.
"Boy let me tell you what"
People really have to stop feeding the squirrels in this park.
See Fido, they do exist.
Bark please, this is not virtual reality.
They call it global warming, but we know it’s not real.
Kids these days, just walking around not bothering to shave anymore. Disgusting!
Toto, we’re not in Kansas anymore.
Don't worry. He's just here to deliver mail.
Well, I can see how you confused him with grandpa.
This is why I keep him  on the leash
'Judge the deed and not the breed,' my ass!
We can only take him home if you promise to share your kibbles.
You make Friends with him and I'll go back to the car and get a treat that you can give him.
I told you not to eat liver after six.
Sasquatch?   Sounds like identity theft to me!
I wouldn't pay this hobo even if he was an actual werewolf.
Geeze. I only suggested a nail trim.
Everyone is different. You have to learn that it is not what's on the outside that counts.
Well, I think she's quite fetching
Please write "Relax, Puffles, I have a silver bullet."
Dare to bark at him.
Just when things were looking bleak, Timmy  noted  an opportunity to launch his excellent groin intrusion maneuver.
Hang on, it’s tough to turn with you all watching me.
Don’t worry, you had your “Purina Beneful at church this morning
Ask him if anyone ever found that case of Canadian Club.
Isn't this air pollution scary?
We’re too stressed out. It’s time we meditated...
When my therapist said I needed to face my monsters, I didn't think she meant that literally.
She looks nothing like her profile on Tinder.
That's right, make things worse!!
Not to worry, Killer.
Well Bowser, as ferocious as your ancestors were, none of us are once we’ve been domesticated.

Just remember dog don't have souls
I think you can take him.
Well.... Go sniff his crotch.
Here's your chance....Sic em!
Relax, it's just a Pomeranian.
Bark, doggone you!
Here's your chance.
Does your dog bite?
Wanna sniff his butt?
Here's your big test as my emotional support animal... I've had nightmares about this monster since I was 5 years old!
YOU can take him.
This is why we had to cut back on the kibble
One alone is no problem, but don't mess with a pack of them
I know you want to sniff his butt–try and resist the urge.
This is the last time I give you psychedelics.
We're going to need a bigger poop bag.
Still feeling the call of the wild, Rocky?
Poppa!!!
Relax Fido, it’s only my mother in-law.
Fido, let’s talk about your taste in friends.
How many times must I show you how it's done?
Sic' em, Princess.
I pretty sure he's an allegory, boy...unfortunately, I've forgotten his meaning.
I’m sorry, Steve.  I thought tonight was a waxing gibbous.”
What does he smell like?
It's okay, Charlie. His pa came from the Black Lagoon, but he's friendly now.
Okay, remember: Stay cool and let me do the talking.
He's actually a rescue. We both are.
Is it too much to ask?
Sacrificially speaking, now's your chance to prove you're my best friend.

Milk in the batter, milk in the batter...
Don't mind him, that's his favorite scary pose, He's really a woos.
Don't worry.  He's a poor jumper.
We need to either change our route or start remembering the poop bags.
Don't I always say, if you plant your bulbs too early in the season then some beast will surely dig them up?
No, I don't see a family resemblance. Let's keep looking for your mom somewhere else, like back in the city.
Sic him Beowulf!
Do you have an extra poop bag by chance?
Son, I'd like you to meet your mother.
It looks like me when I go a day without 'The New Yorker' magazine
Frazetta did it better.
If you try hard enough, someday you can grow up to be Doggie President too.
How dare you assume that just because I'm a werewolf I identify as a man!
Worst bloodhound ever.
Maurice  says he  will  meet  us  here
tonight!
You have nothing to be jealous of... I used to walk him a long time ago.
It's my mother-in-law..
Will he bite?
You just couldn't hold it, could ya?
It's not nice to stare. But you can bark if you'd like.
I knew I shouldn't have let my wife name my dog Beowulf."
That you reminds you of her, too
Honey I told you getting a dog would be more trouble than it's worth.
Okay, Seymour. Okay. Yes, Milton can transform into an awesome Beast Lord. But you make a damn fine pup-pup, Seymour. You really do. Head high.
It's not betrayal.  It's a sacrifice.  Huge difference.
This is why a leash is a good idea.
Make your face, Gorr, that guy from the bar's been following us.
Get acquainted with the litter box, Mittens.
Attack, Rocky!
Now you know why we don't visit your grandpuppy.
I've a feeling we're not in SoHo anymore.
Wolfbane smulfbane she said...
I can’t believe those people who let their pets off leash
Just ignore him. He's CG.
Come now, show a little backbone George
I don't think Ancestry.com is right every time
What comes after sit-stay?
This is The New Colossus?
OK, Don't Sic Em.
Now I a poopie bag.
Do not sniff his butt.
Stop Whitey, you are scaring  it.
I told you she wouldn't be happy you pee'd on the rug again
Take the dog for a walk, she says. How much of a hardship can it possibly be?
What did I tell you about knowing your enemies?
Doggy day care .
Listen, we've had a good run, but I'm about to run like hell, and I'm betting you're slower than me.
This tree was marked by a werewolf.   I think you should respect his territory.
I don’t know what would happen if he bites you.
Obedience school dropout
IT'S DONALD TRUMP
This park has a leash law, people! Who's is this?
This is what happens when you don't retrieve your toys.
I thought you would enjoy a play date?
Ok, here's your wolf.  What are you afraid of?
See, this is why man's best friend is fake news
It was either me or you.
So *this* is why we had to go on an extra long walk tonight?
New Jersey has everything!
Couldn't find a Cesar Milan on Groupon.
This guy is a big phony blowhard.
Watch FOX News for something scary
Ok, you kind of misrepresented "let's go visit my brother."
See boy, he’s not neutered.
This is what you'll turn into if you don't take your worm medicine.
I'LL DROP YOUR LEASH AND YOU  GO GET HIM.
See? That's what happens when you're not properly paper-trained.
For goodness' sake, you evolved from the prehistoric wolf.
I told you we should just go to the dog park, but no that wasn't good enough for you.
I just think his bight might be worse than his bark !
Fido, what did you eat?
So much for looking for your origins.
Seems it likes you
Have you been eating my special leaves I told you to stay away from?
Shall we give him a hug?
He's really being extra, isn't he?
I thought they kept Stephen Miller locked in the White House. Don't be afraid, he only hurts children.
Daddy?
Not again.
Even in virtual reality, I have to walk the dog?
...so you see, we ARE related!
Look, we already have 4 dogs. We just don't have room for a fifth, Rex.
We have to control our fears and prejudices. We don't want people to  tell us that we're bigots, because all our fears are the same, so we must be considerate of the other guy's feeling.
Look at me, you imbecile.
Go pee pee
You wanted to play with new dogs - so go play!
Now you will have a friend to play with while I'm a work.
It seems to be a GMO wolfman
Feel free to sic 'em.
The metaphor is obvious.
In what context was the word used when 'praying' for this play date?
Yea, okay, hold on a second, man. 
You know what really scares me? Are the tweets.
I told you , all bark and no bite !2
Oh yeah, notice how scared Bailey is...
No, he's not your daddy.
This park is always off-leash on the full moon.
Fido, BEHIND us––a cartoonist.
THIS is what happens to dogs who don’t take baths, Richard.
Sure,sure -- you make promises now. But we both know that if I let you get him, I'll be the only one remembering to feed him by this time next week.
I did it. Now it's your turn to poop.
No Luke, he is not your father."

I'd be careful buddy, looks like it's that time of the month.
I told you to stop barking -- it triggers her!
no I don't think he will be good to eat
I get it, I get it- you're still upset about the aggression training.
Walking my roommate’s mutt at midnight.  How could this evening get any worse?
Meet your uncle Were.
No. I don't think he could be your Father.
I guess the question we should’ve been asking is, who rescues who?
Wait, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Why, yes, I suppose there's a genetic connection, but I wouldn't push it.
Well. Looks like we’re both “good boys” now.
No, Rover, I’m NOT going to ask him if he’s toilet-trained.
Don’t get any delusions of grandeur.
If you will insist on the road less traveled.
I said, 'Sic' em!' What part of that don't you understand?
That's it!! No more midnight treats for you.
I'm thinking you probably shouldn't have marked that last tree.
Okay, okay, now I see why he's your ex.
Did you conjure your ancestors again?
Come on, this IS an off-leash area
Woofers, it's time you met your dad, Hellhound.
It's his time of the month.
For god's sake, Cosmo, don't bark.
It's a chupacabra. I suggest you forego your goat impersonation.
No, you cannot go eat butter, with your brother.
Just what I need another wolfman looking for a blowjob.
I see your point about the leash.
Please don't pet me, I'm working.
Obedience 101, the devil's in the detail.
At least someone here passed the off-leash portion of obedience school.
Or you could get your rabies shot.
Just focus on your invincible core beingness.
I won't judge you.
At least he’s potty trained
I told her it was a mistake to name you Sasquatch!
I told you to stop pooping on his lawn.
He says, "Take me to your fire plug."
Now you should be barking.
This is what apathy brings us!
I know what you think you see, but it’s just the mailman. Relax.
Don't just stand there, you're supposed to be an attack dog, at least think of him as a mailman!
Told you not to eat that poop. Now you’re hallucinating.
Don't worry, Buddy, he won't hurt you.  Professional courtesy.  Your ancestors were once wolves, too.
I'm officially second guessing your call on those mushrooms, Henry.
Well- say something!
Did you conjure this thing or did I?
See, there is nothing scary here at all. Now stop all the barking and carrying on like you know something I don’t.
Did 'Health Benefits of Dog Walking' 
footnote encounters with werewolves?
I told you not to pee on that rock!
Well, he IS offering you the deal of a lifetime.
Well say something. Your from the same gene pool.
Sparky I told you this would happen if you didn't layoff of my Jack Daniels.
Sometimes your sister turns into a horrible bitch!
So...this is the "farm" we told the kids you were going to.
Glad you’re wearing your deer tick medication.
I think I'm losing interest in e-mail.
I already told you - my name is not Johnny and I do NOT play the fiddle!
Not sure if he speaks your language or mine.
Are you going to introduce me to your friend?
Don't stare. It just wants attention.
Don't be rude, Mikey. Say hello.
Just don't look him in the eyes, maybe he'll just go away.
Selective breeding really did a number on you...
Hey babe, I'm not sure Tinkles is up for this."
I knew I should have brought my fiddle.
Buck, your aloofness is really starting to bother me.
You deal with him. He's your crazy uncle.
Now I know why they say “Adopt, don’t shop.”
It's just a werewoof  Remus___
Back to Halloween advertising is earlier than ever.
Do you have someone to pick up after you too?
So, are going to sniff his butt or not?
That is what happens to little dogs that don't behave.
Okay Boris, you've got to remember this is NOT a fire hydrant.
.....and you thought your twin wasn't a werewolf
Curb it or point him to the men's room?
This is what happens when you hump the furniture.
He looks like the wreck of the Hesperus...
Don't be afraid.  He's actually friendly.
I thought the movie version was much scarier.
These hallucinogens are intense.
Time to man up, Max.
So you dragged me all the way here just to say hi to Fifi?
See, I told you we have a common ancestor.
Hurry up! I gave to go too!
Meet your new partner, “Beauty.”
It's your great grandfather.  Show some respect
Don't ask. You never asked why your name is Spot!
"Think carefully Barney if you want to be like him opportunities like this come along once in a full moon.
Don't poop.
Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
He knows the safe word.
Right, he had a mustache, then he was orange, but it’s the same old crap.””
Of course his bark is worse than his bite.
Come on you always hesitate when we get to the vet.
Ugh, doesn’t anyone know about the leash laws in this state?
Trust me,  bipedal isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.
Don't worry Fido, it's just your great grandfather out for a stroll.
Good thing I named you Chupacabra. Sic im, I say!
They really do become monsters at this time of the month
What the hell did you eat yesterday, Charlie?
It's just a figment of my imagination, Buddy.
See, I told you those home DNA kits aren't reliable.
Before you, I had an emotional support demon.
That's not a squirrel, Dad.
I think he understands you better.
Go for it.  We’ll just keep the runt.
No, he wasn't your sperm donor.
Buddy, remember, the first line of defense is to prevent eye contact.
Don't worry.  He just likes to play in the full moon.
Time for your puppy dog face.
I never thought the green new deal would go this far
And THIS is why I insisted on a pure bred!
"Bye, old Sport; TOLD you we wouldn't survive the decade
On the bright side, I bet his butt smells out of this world...
Don't even think about chewing my running shoes again.
Yeah, Danny, today I'm with you, 'Bite me!'
Come on Be-be,time to pee-pee!
You're not going to do anything?
I spy, with my little eye, something that begins with W.
This is what happens if you root through the garbage.
Just howl with him, you do it every night.
I don't care if you used 23 and me,this is NOT your eligitiment brother!!!

He was once a good boy.
Then he played violent video games. Look well. Learn.
Do you really put that much faith in OK Cupid?
Don't worry buddy, you'll get there someday.
His growl is worse than his bite.
This time we better stay off the grass.
You’re only 128th werewolf, Buttercup
See, this is why we don't bite.
Tale as old as time, Song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the beast..
No, he is not the dog Golem
You were going to see a man about a dog?
Okay, okay, I'll take out the trash.
The off-leash park is across the street.
I think we can get by him
I knew we shouldn’t have taken him off those tranquilizers
He's out here every full moon, singing 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips'  until dawn.
Go on, take a piss. We haven't got all night.
Animatronics don't do it for you either?
Quick! Go pee on his leg!
Can you tell him 'down boy' in Dog?
Spot, these playdates are getting out of hand.
I think he’s just after your dinner. Wha’d you say ?
If only you were really a service dog...
Man’s Best Friend”? Are you are saying you sold us out for Alpo
Now would be a good time to put on your watchdog persona.
What, you ain't got nothin' to say?
Shall I change your dog food?
Well, this wouldn’t have happened if Bill would just buy a leash.
There there, that blood curdling cackle is just his way of saying hello!”
OK, if we take him home you have to feed him, walk him and clean up after him.
The one time I leave my crossbow at home.
All cats appear as monsters to puppies
Is the leash law beginning to make sense to you?
He thinks that's his father.
Well, maybe next time you'll remember to mark your spot.
He's his own Good Boy, I suppose.
I told you to stop digging for bones in the family plot
Good Boy, say hello to Bad Boy. He'll be staying in our back yard.
Tell it you’re taken.
You’re projecting again
It’s JUST a rat brute.
It's climate change, Rover. It'll get us all someday.
Really, Wanda? Really?
Easy, Boy. It's looks are worse than its intentions.
What's really scary is that I forgot to bring a dog poop bag.
Well? Bark at him or something.
Don't feel embarrassed. Everyone has a family member like that somewhere.
No, that kidney in his hand is not a treat.
Typical, now that you've caught yourself a Wendigo you don't even know what to do with it.
Why don’t you play with your new big friend and I’ll meet you back home?”
So, Fluffy, do you sic 'em or do we run?
Fine. I'll walk the dog again.
Look, you don't have to like it. Just accept that I'm a werewolf fucker.
You said it would be a waxing gibbous tonight.
Maybe she was just using me to get to you.
Good thing we neutered you
Other than Dick Cheney, you actually share more DNA with him than humans.
So this is "yiffing", huh?
Sometimes, emotional support involves barking a bit.
This is why you never see my wife at night.
Fetch!
That's one bad mother ....

You're supposed to be a truffle dog not a mushroom dog!
Charlie....are you imagining an Ogre again?  No more corn on the cob for you!

Try wagging your tail. See if he’s Shmoozer Friendly!
At least you could bark!
See what could happen to you if you don’t go to a good Training School and get a good education?
Relax-it’s just your buddy from the dog park.
If this doesn't make it come out, I don't know what will
I didn't expect Mom to do that either.
Now do you see?  That's what happens to bad doggies who get off their leash.
If I hear the words "Loch Ness Monster one more time I'm going to scream.
NOW aren’t you glad you’re not Lassie?
Now Fodo, if you don't obey me, that's who'll get you.
Okay,so there's your mom. You finally met the bitch. Happy now?
Guessing she looked better in her profile pic?
You do not wanna sniff my butt right now.
I know what you're thinking but I think it looks more canine than human.
You don't have to outrun him. You just have to outrun me...
Thanks for bringing my dinner.
Eh, what else ya got?
It's sad, but ogres have lost out to humans as to who's more frightening.
I get it. 'THERE wolf.' Funny.
Let's see if the Beast devours this giant squash you peed on.
Sure, you hate going. But that's what YOU'D look like if you weren't groomed every month.
Mmm...they said dogs sight is not that good, I’m wondering what is he looking at

It must be in your imagination.
Did you bite the mailman?
Don’t worry, his dog is friendly.
I told you he was a lunatic.
Lets hope he's a vegetarian.
And that, my friend, is my ex-wife.
Does this scare the shit out of you?
If I let you off your leash, will you protect me?
See what happens when kids play too many violent video games?
If this was my mom I would have wanted to be adopted too.
Stay, Trixie. Stay.
This ain’t nothin’. 
Wait until you corner your first cat!
Most women have an easier time with menopause.
Don't worry, he's friendly.
So now you forget how to bark. Just pretend it’s our mailman, or the TV, or that cute girl at the park, or the microwave, or the fridge, or that cute girl at the park.
I can't believe he is off leash.
You know, my servant here knows a very good barber.
You'll never be a very good guard dog.
Uhmmmmmmmmmmmm.......
A little late for the spore print Honey.
I doubt I can outrun it Fido...luckily I can outrun you.
(Dog to owner) If I am a good boy and do everything you say, will I grow up to be as big as him?
You can’t make life about the Boogieman

Huh . . .
Please don't tell me that he's more afraid of me.

I am definitely including this in my YELP review...
See, Rover? This is what happens when you run outside at night.
Are you hallucinating again?
I get it. Mommy's the cool one.
Don't worry, Fido. Sometimes, there's an oddball ancestor in the geneaological line.
Don’t worry, it only comes out when there is a full moon over the mews.
This is a golden opportunity to see who can run faster!

Him or me? Sorry muffin...
Sic 'em, Farnsworth!
My Bonky's a mixed pedigree dog, part pointer and part moron.
I miss the 'Dog eat dog world', too.
So what do you say Buddy, shall we take him on?
Hello, handsome. You're a good-looking fellow, do you know that? People laugh at you, people hate you, but why do they hate you? Because...they are jealous. Look at that boyish face. Look at that sweet smile. Do you wanna talk about physical stren...
Really?  You’re not going to protect me from him?
This cartoon makes absolutely no sense.
I guess they were having some trouble enforcing the leash law.

This is your mother, Chewy.
This is where old cartoon characters come to die.
Here''s the scene:  I say 'sic'em' and exit stage right.
Look at it this way - in the morning you'll still be a dog, and he'll go back to being a frozen pea tester.
...and your little dog handler too.
No, I don’t think you should get a little closer for a good sniff.
Not to worry, Fido. It’s only a cover reject from August 26 issue of The New Yorker.
Tell mommy goodnight. We'll see her again in the morning.
''Lilliputian, it's time for a conversation or you had better know how to swim!"

Don't bark or show fear, and he will look for someone else to scare.
...and this is how I met your mother.
I told you I didn’t want to use Waze!
I wish you’d consider using the toilet inside”
How about if you pretend it's the mail carrier?
And I only brought one clean-up bag.
How's many times did you hear me say, "Judith, don't eat the mushrooms."?
Don't just stand there -- go sniff him!
I think it's a soul retriever.
You know I don’t get along with my inlaws, so let’s keep this under an hour.

Yes, we could have called, but see how happy your mother is when we come to visit on her birthday?

No, you rescued ME, remember?
I thought it might help you "go" a bit quicker.

Don't worry.  He only eats poodles.
You’re a rescue dog! Rescue me!
Quit dawdling Sparky, it's just a tree.
What are you doing here, we were trying to have a personal conversation.
If you bark at him he will disappear in a poof!
Did mixing the mushrooms with your dog food get you there, Fido?
He’s your dad not mine!
Relax, he can't even bark.  He just sings falsetto and he hates it!

Oh I get it. "Another Sasquatch sighting."
This is how I was trained.
You bark at my gym bag, but not that thing?
Wolf? Where?
Is this the woof you've been telling me about?
Rover. if this doesn't move your bowels, nothing will!
Shake?!
Are you peeing because you’re marking your territory?
Why aren't you barking Yoda? Does that mean its NOT a satanic wolf monster?

You just HAD to go walkies, didn't you?

I think he last appeared in "American Graffiti."
You better not bark or you will scare him.
Too much product ?
Don't listen to him, boy. He was a bad dog, trained that's good.
Sic! Sic! Sic!  What are you waiting for?
Don’t be concerned; he’s not a ‘cat person’ .
You should probably go around me. I'm terrified of dogs.
You've got to be kidding.
Why is my dog having such boring DNA?.
Puddles- Attack!
Rufus, why did our ancestors think that interbreeding was a good idea?
You tell him his howling interrupts your neighborhood conversations.
You've got quite an imagination.
See what happens when you bark at the moon too much!
Don't worry -- just wag your tail and he'll love you!
I hope now you see why this park requires dogs on-leash.  You could have been in a fight!
Where's that killer bark when we need it, Bubbles?
Never eat these.
Definitely off leash.
Rex, meet your father.
Oh God, I hate running into my ex-wife when it's my weekend with the kid

Not your type... believe me!
Looking back on it, I think I mixed up our samples in the DNA ancestry tests.
Ginger, I don't think they make 'poop bags' big enough for him.
And, if you don't eat your Kibbles, you'll look just like that when you grow up!
That´s you in the future, if you still eating human food.

Can your dog go swimming with me?
Get him, Lemondrop!
Dog on it.

Are you sure you're related?
I need a restroom, QUICK!
This sis Steve Martin. He's been helping out.
You really don't want to be around Larry Talbot when he's like this.
I knew I should’ve had you spaded yesterday !
Aaaghhh, Did you pee on that?! Did you JUST pee on that??
He’s only trying to appeal to his base.
It’s OK, Toby. He only eats cats.
Sik it, now!
Bowser....sick em!
"Still want to howl at the moon?"
These Twilight fans are getting out of hand.
See.  When the neighbors call you the ‘Hound from Hell’ they were using hyperbole.
Don't go getting any ideas, now.
.. haven't you seen a woolf before?... we better run,now comes the worst part!
What do you smell?
I would advise against marking your territory.
See what happens when you won’t take your medicine
Ok, I found a new one. Throw him the ball!
Still enjoying these midnight potty breaks?
Figment of my imagination? That's what you said last time.

Snack Pack !  Yummy !
OK.  Fine.  I admit now that Peter is more of a dog person.
Try barking, its not just just your fantasy image of me.
That there is your older brother, make sure you don't turn out like him.
He doesn't want to shake your paw.
Somehow, I don't think a belly rub and a 'good boy' are going to do it.
This is what we trained for Snowflake. Bite his nose as hard as you can, and I'll run for help.
He's more your relative than mine.
Show me, who can howl better than me.
He's a bluffer, Max. I bought him that outfit.
Yes Sparky her hair is shiny in the moonlight, but don't get any ideas, she's way out of your league.
Relative of yours?
Forget the leash — just think of the size of those plastic bags.”
This is Bigfoot's brother Murray
The shelter said you were good with hobgoblins.
Would this be a good time to tell you the doctor found NO sign of chemtrail poisoning in my blood?

Let's go. You can be a werewolf for Halloween.
There!
Don't worry, he is just trying to scare us.
One day this will all be yours...
See. I told you the noise wasn’t another dog.
Just wanted to show you what happens if you eat my testosterone pills and drink my Rogaine!
Don't worry Spot. He's probably afraid of dogs.
I don't care if he IS your cousin. Last time he stayed overnight, he ate all of MY cousins.
So I didn't curb my dog.
Don't worry. His bark is worse than his bite.
Ha! Little does he know the heart of Lionel Haggard.
It's been months since the longest government shutdown in history, and the parks are still a mess.
What is he saying boy?" "He said to leave the bedroom window open.
Fido and Goliath
Can't you hang out with a less scary imaginary friend?
Teena, you may become the mother of a brand new breed.
Nature isn't all peaches and cream, Dexter.
He's the one I saw drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's.
His roommate doesn't need to take him for walks three nights a month.
Some attack dog you are.
See what happens when we go O-U-T after midnight?
I think it's your turn.
Is that your cousin or mine? I've lost track.
Don’t get any ideas now
Technically, you two are distant cousins.
Feel free to sniff his butt while I wait elsewhere.
Bob, I don’t think 39andWoof was a good idea.
GET HELP REX !"   "And this time, don't go to a Psychiatrist !!
I said, 'Roll over.'
Not as scary as the dog park.
I'm running for President. Let me tell you about my health care plan.
Is that your Big Daddy coming to reclaim you?
It’s ok.  He’s a figment of my imagination.
You're the one who wanted to meet your "real" Dad.
I told you to swipe left!
Now show him YOUR bite.
Well, when are you going to bark?
Replacing the Bear on Wall Street
You had to bark at the wrong tree. Happy now?
You wanted a sea change from the neighbor's kitty, right?
I got a nasty feeling about this
Some guard dog you are.
Hey, you're the one who insisted on taking a walk.
Don't look so impressed, it's just a phase.
If you need to go, then do it now.
Look at this asshole
Here's where I hope to capitalize on the skills you've been learning at guard dog school, Muffin.
Just had to go for a walk now, didn't you.
THIS is why I wanted you to use the cat's litter box tonight, but NOOOOO...!!!
He doesn't get out, much.  

Douglas Faulkner, Guelph, Ont.
We're supposed to be looking for truffles.
I thought you said this was dog park.
If you poop inside the house one more time . . . . .
that is indeed the moon and this furry fellow has more a howl than a bark . satisfied?
You’ve been watching too much TV.
No, Fido, Sally’s mother is not coming back!
Now, will you stop howling at night?
There, now does that STILL look like a fire hydrant to you?
Same great, great, great, great, great grandparents. His line ate steroid beef. Yours ate vegan.
Sit!, Stay!, Now Spot, convince him that we are all actually animals.
Don’t worry.  It’s just the Ghost of President Past.
Don’t worry Max. It’s just that time of month.
That's what you'd look like if I bit you!
This state really needs a leash law.
Fefe, meet Grandma Grendel. She wants us to help her gather some firewood.
I think the mescaline is kicking in...
This is one of the least interesting things I've seen on a dog walk.
Better get used to it...since that executive order to open up the 7th circle of hell I’ve seen 6 of these guys this week!
I know. Middle age is hard because you realize you’ll never be what you wanted to be when you grow up.
Move out into the country they said, it will be nice a peaceful they said !
What a coincidence! I also used to be a bloodhound!
Okay...remember when the mailman came yesterday?
Looks like the library is getting serious about my unpaid 78 cent overdue book fine.

Hot dog!
The Devil Went Up to Vermont
Hopefully tonight is the night your bite is worse than your bark.
I know, I know. I'm the Hellhound.
But he gives me treats!
I sold my soul for treats!
My wife told me to pick up her mom after the hike, but how do I explain this to the dog?
That’s an odd sized gourd.
A cousin of yours, I presume ?
He has a leash. It's just a more self-reflective model
You didn't tell me we'll be meeting up with your half brother.
Trust me Bob, I can take him.
He may be a monster, but he's got your DNA and mine.
Do you have an extra doggy bag?
Attack, or it's back to the pound!
That reminds me that I need to schedule a dog grooming appointment.
Relax, it’s just the Devil in disguise.
Next time I say stay I mean it!
In time you will learn to love him as much as I do.
SIC him!  I’m running for help!
This is what happens when you refuse to go close to the house !”
You’re right! One of us does only have two legs..but one of us is about to hand over the leash to that thing with one of our two hands!
Heel, Waldo.
Oh My! A Single Malt Scotch Lad tied into an Irish Terrier named Tullamore. God may be good, after all.
This is the last time we take our walk through this neighborhood around Halloween.
Hold your pee it's not a topiary!
Your catching hell for drinking out of the toilet
I warned you what would happen if you didn’t “sit” on command.
Even the best sniff isn't worth the worst butt.
Okay, Doggie-Dude - Time to show them you’ve got nuts
Stupid mutt! I told you to leave that LSD alone!
Don't be nervous, she's daddy's new friend.
'You'd better take this one.'
My worst nightmare has orange hair!
Just a head's up. Even good masters have a dark side. Mind the rug.
'Dude, I'm the one with the great olfactory powers. I'm sayin' it's a guy in a wolf outfit who hasn't changed his underwear in a week.'
Do you think you’ll “pass” that silver bullet you ate any time soon?
...Any other dog would have just picked up on a squirrel...
You howled...now let's see you do something about it.
I think a growl would in order.
Now you decide not to bark. What the devil's gotten into you?
This is why we feed you the organic food.
Oh so, you only pull on the leash when you're far away. Looks like you're all bark.
And this, Rocco, is why you don’t take steroids
Fido, don' worry he's not armed with an assault weapon.
Don't you hate it when the local monsters spend too much time watching Fosse
Attach!, Fido.  Attach!!!
You see what might happen if we have kids
Can you believe , Mr. Wilson, that virtual reality can look so real ? 
To my dog eyes, though, this loch monster is a real mess . They should improve him with augmented reality instead......
This is your uncle Jason.  He was accidentally given a "temper" vaccination.
He's an emotional support monster.
I don’t suppose shouting sic ‘em would motivate you
Checkers, starting over doesn't look good for us.
Don’t look at me. He’s your cousin.
OK, Toby. If he lunges, you're gonna have to use your AR-15.
Did you bring the extra poo-bags?
sure, even the veterinarian  saysits lots to orchestrate just so toto makes a solid bowel movement.
I thought you might want to meet him. DoggieDNA.com says you’re 19% related.
This is where Deadpool surely would break the fourth wall.
Why would I carry waste bags? I left DC to get away from the gentrification.
I think you should wake up now.
Teddy, I know what you're thinking, but just this once I'm going to recommend that you skip the butt smelling.
Don't bite him unless he threatens us.
It's okay, Buddy. He just wants to play.
Don't worry Charlie, he's vegetarian.
You going to believe me or your lying eyes?
What do you mean I don't scare you? Try this on for size! You mean that didn't scare you either? What am I missing? OK, you want to be friends? I'm really not scary at all. I only look this way. You want a treat? Come here and give me  a kiss."
Make our homes and streets SAFE! VOTE REPUBLICAN
And you STILL won't poop?  We're going home.
This is why we should refrain from taking walks during a full moon.
What happened to no eye contact, no pointing?
Come on Buddy,
You can take him....
Just remember,
In this situation
Keep thinking
'My bite is bigger than my bark!
I know, Pluto is a dog as well.
You and your damn breeding...
And yet, Mr. Biscuits eating my homework is still a far-fetched fantasy to Professor Lupin.
Our neighbor, Mr. Banner, forgot to leash his dog again.
Leave it. Leave it. Sorry, he can be a little aggressive sometimes.
Don't ask him to scratch behind your hears.
Now you know why I don't like ticks!
Fido, it’s just a figment of your imagination, nothing to worry about.
Do you see, Cheetoh... this is what happens when you eat shoe leather.
This is not what I thought you meant by 'more scenic route'.
Oh, I thought you lived in Loch Ness!
Your DNA results came back 35% Pit Bull ......start acting like it!
Welcome to your ancestor.
See what happens when you eat table scraps.

Do you sneak him a double espresso again?
Well, it is a full moon.  He can't help it.  He is a feral Farrow.  Just don't mention Woody Allen.
Master he reminds me of my inner devil
Look, Fang—Fluffy’s out again!
Did you pee in grandpa slippers again?
It's just a fancy bush, George.
Come on bigfoot, let's go for walkies.
You can if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Well at least someone in this town feels like he can be himself.
This is why we don’t buy off-brand dog food.
The website said this was the easy trail
I didn't think his mom was this hideous.
Fortunately for us, he doesn't realize there's an eclipse tonight.  On the other hand, it doesn't start until midnight.
See, Megan.  You're not the only one.
Trust us that you need to stick with organic, gluten and grain free food.
No, I don’t think that having you neutered makes a big difference.
What are you looking at? I thought it was a figment of my imagination.
Don’t worry Fluffy he doesn’t bit
I said Time for a walk."
You said "On the wild side."
No, his bite is worse than his howl.
See there's nothing to be afraid of so quit waking me up!
He only wants to make friends, wag your tail!
No ,it's not my mother -in-law!
Sorry pal, I didn't bring your doggie bag.
I guess kneel won’t quite cut it this time, huh?
He must have been a bad boy.
Whoops. Wrong park.
I really chose the wrong guard dog.
That's a tree, right Chalie? Tell me it's a tree.
Oh yeah? Watch this!
Then who the hell else are you talkin' to?
This is a rarity a Giant werewolf in the daylight certainly nothing to be afraid of at all
Rex, I don't recommend peeing on his leg.
Sweetheart , come see this and bring the kids!!
Kiss your ass goodbye.”

Don Dechman—Austin, T
So Baxter, you say this cute little Yorkie asked you out on a romantic moonlit walk???
And do you have any little cousins I could eat?- I mean meet
Now would be a great time to poop out the silver bullet you ate earlier today
Seriously? I really wish he'd appointed Donny or Eric president of Greenland rather than your Mommy.
I narrate, therefore I am.
Still want to share the cabin with your relatives?
Growl at him real fierce-like, Fido.
Don't worry. He's a vegetarian.
He's more of a cat person than a dog person.
I told you we shouldn't have let your sister splash in that toxic pool
No,I don’t think it wise to have him dog set you. Just a feeling.
I’m thinking its just a giant squirrel  who got over treated with antibioics by a vet.  Bark very loudly and get ready to run if it doesn’t work.
“Gee Boomer, is this what you were barking at in the middle of the night.”
See this is what happens when you take supplements!
Did my great grandpa really grow that big when he was angry?
Looks like he could use a therapy dog.
Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. However, now might be a good time for some "HELP."
Yes! You sure can pet him. Thanks for asking.
Don't worry. I know the scent of a chipmunk," you tell me
Don't believe what you see! It's just a concept like "climate change" created by the Chinese to make us non-competitive.
You talk a big game now. But last night there was just a little bit of thunder and you peed on the carpet.
Got my bag ready...
calm down, he is not a cannibal...
Fido’s therapist says he needs more exposure to fresh air and feral wildlife. - Jan Liverance
Hey, better you than me, now go!
Now might be the time for that terrifying bark we’ve heard so much about.
It's OK, boy. They just drained the swamp. You can lower your interest.
Walkies, my ass!
Relax buddy, it’s just the mailman...
So why should I have to walk HER dog?
I guess you really do have a cold.
Don't worry, he's only auditioning for Disney.
He's obviously someone's lost pet.
We're not playing fetch with this guy.
Think of it as my favorite wing tips.
If you're going to do your business on someone else's property 
you have to be prepared for the consequences.
The Yelp review said this was a dog park, not a petting zoo. Strange.
Don't worry, it's just your malicious double.
And this is why we must always remain "just friends".
Whaddya know...there really IS a creature in the Blue Lagoon.
Our leash is stronger than you'd think.
And just how long does your mother-in-law plan on staying?
So much for "All Dogs Go to Heaven"
Really? The nose ALWAYS knows?
We found some of his breed in your DNA.
If you think I’m a tree
And that you can pee on me
Move one paw closer 
AND I WILL EAT THEE!
I refuse to believe you came from the same puppy mill.
You could be like that on steroids!
Now is the time to bark.
If you don't stop peeing on the rug....
That young demon survived, that I set free.
See? Man is wolf to man. You’re man’s best friend.
You wanted to meet your birth dad? Deal.
why am I not frightening ?
This cartoon sucks.
His hair is perfect.
Is that your mother?"  I dunno . .
Not to worry honey... just an invader from the North
His roar is worse than his gore.
Go say hi... He doesn't look mean in color.
Whatever, there's no exceptions to the leash laws.
I told you , you hadn't met the other side of our  family.
American eskimo dog meets American werewolf from Paris.
Oh, my gawd! Look at that pup! Come here! 

I hate how everyone acts like I'm invisible when my dog is around.
And you thought it was a coyote!
Do you really need all those bones?
Ah, so this is who you’re waiting on when you sniff around for hours.
What can I tell ya.  It's a dog-eat-demon world out there.  Sick 'em.
Don't worry, he won't bite
Watch...waaatch....
you have to vote for me or you'll lose everything!
This is what happens when you do your business without covering it up.
So he was your former master, huh?
Didn't we use your Platinum card? See what they can do for us now.
Sic-em, Fluff!
Look closely.  This is sort of what I am asking for when I say “Up”.
Fido, what on earth did you put on your Tindr profile?
Didn't you see the sign? This is a "leash only" area.
I suppose that I should fake it and act scared for this walking cliche.
It's not true - there are cats in hell.
I'm sorry but therapy dogs don't get to have their own therapy animals.
Technically, this makes you my cousin.
This is how I want you to behave when the trick-or-treaters come to the house.
Go get him, Max.  He's Climate Change personified.
You think I you have bad days...
It's okay, boy... just some ex-New Yorker.
It’s your absent father.
Next time, perhaps a few more squirts to mark your territory.
Devil. And heel.
How many times have I told you not to pee on tht bush?
You knew that finding your birth mom would be ruff.
No leash,  I can forgive, but no poop bag is really gross.
Don't be getting any ideas.
Yes, Lon Chaney Jr., but that was just the movie.
Not sure if I should "roof" or "wolf"
Hey, don’t look at me.  He’s your cousin.
I'm so tired of their owners letting them off their leashes.
Well, maybe Yelp reviews are not the best source for finding a dog walker.
Aww you will be fine with her! 
Look into the night and imagine my new girlfriend moving in.
Starting now, depending on the lunar cycle, we're doing some walks before sunset.
If you want to get along with women, you have to pretend you’ve never seen him.
I don't think your mom would approve.  He is only half wolf.
Don't worry. Your bark is worse than his height.
Relax, he's all bark and no bite.
It's where the wilder things are, Stupid!"
Odd, it has never before appeared in the US.
What are you looking at? I never wanted the dog.
Look carefully Rover. that's what will happen to you if you keep howling at the moon every night
You see, my pup, nature is full of many beasts, and we must respect them all.
But you bark at the little poodle down the street!
You should know, I'm the chosen one.
And I don’t even get to watch
I told you dogs not to drink the water.
Of course you still won't poop.
You've been such a goodbye.
Did you every think you would see a Frazetta swipe in the New Yorker?
Dogs aren't allowed here due to mysterious disappearances. Not you and me. We are rule breakers.
This is the absolute bottom for 4-Dimensional movies
This lunar distance relationship is going to be tricky...
If cut, I bleed too! And, I need love too!
I begged you to stop baying at the moon.
Meet your great, great grand-wolf!
It's just Bob, the Forest Ranger, rehearsing for Halloween."
A lot of hounds howl at the moon, but my cousin Ralph takes it too far.
You really want to sniff it’s ass, don’t you?
This Dog Park gives me the creeps.
See.  That's what happens when you eat poop!
We really need to finish building The Wall
May I remind you that you‘re man‘s
don,t worry  his roar is louder than his bite
This is what's waiting for dogs that don't heel.
Okay, here's the plan: you distract him while I run away as fast as I can, and...well...it was nice knowing you.
Meet your new master.
See what happens when you don't use a leash?
Roll-over!
It’s if we had a kid, you know, sexy time and all.”
Show him howl its done.
I said, KILL!  Okay, STAY! Keep him busy while I run like hell.
Hush lassie, this isn’t a real one!
Good they, Ollie.
What if his bite is worse than his bark?
Apparently, LOVE is a dog from hell.
Nothing to fear, it is just retails dramatic way to try and sell us products before it becomes in-season.
It may be rearing its ugly head, but it's not inflation.
That's what you looked like after Saturday night.
Did you remember to bring home the leftovers?
Sparky, quick, we have to fuse.
Awww, I ate a dog just like him when I was young.
I present you my last best friend. Depression was rough without you bud.
I thought you said he was trapped in a well?
And then -- surprise! -- our president turned into a ravening beast! You really have to watch out on the full moon, Sparky.
Now might be a good time to put that "man's best friend"  cliche to good use.
It’s only my boss Rex, he hasn’t had his coffee yet.
Mr. Mazel – Like we see on that Serengeti show! Now it’s our turn to run like the bejesus…
You and your shortcuts!
I told you - THIS is why you need to do your business just before bed and NOT in the middle of the night - but did you listen? No.
OK, now see what barking will get you.
So… how about a date so we can get this potato head out of the way.
Hey Brother, could you help a terrifying, man-eating monster out?
Quit complaining about me, it could be worse.
You have seen so much scarier one TV!
Just another day on the moors.
I AM the “Devil Dog”!Dare not lift your hind leg here!
Bad looks aren’t everything.
See what happens after a one-night stand!
I wish that you'd stop getting into the  neighbor's garbage Rex.
Isn't that the guy from 12M?
C'mon Daisy... attack!
It's just the people from animal rescue, verifying that I'm eligible to adopt."
See what happens  if you don’t behave yourself ?
Show him that 'ceremony of innocence" look. It melted my heart.
Now do you understand why I regret naming you Darwin?
He froze in the winter.
Forget everything you learned at obedience school!
Yes, your antidepressants may cause some hallucinations. Way?
That’s not your mommy. That’s the other Grendel’s mommy.
Sorry, my condo association doesn't allow pets!
No worries. A growling wolf never bites a gawking dog.
Honestly, the new  pooper scooper enforcement  program has gone too far.
I know you’re jealous now, but in the morning he’ll return to human form.
Are you going to replace me? He won't fit in my kennel!
Maybe you should stop eating pizza at midnight because I’m not real either.
Boy, you forgot the doggie do bag just once.
These monthly visits with your distant cousin bother me.
You kept complaining about having imposter syndrome so I decided to get you a life coach for your birthday
Don't worry, that was just me about 30 million years ago.
It's one of the animals that was taken off the endangered species list!
Yes, he really does run a farm upstate.
See Fido. This is an example when you should cry woof.
Er, I meant "heel."
I know you can take him!
And they say there’s no such thing as climate change!
This is your weird uncle.
Shouldn’t have asked to split the check.
I used to live in the Amazon forest. Then a drone picked me up and dropped me here.
The sign specifically said that all animals in this park had to be leashed...
Consider if you will my dog's reaction to a bloodthirsty monster.
Do you still believe he's, "the least hungry creature there is anywhere in the world"?
Isn’t this a bit of an overreaction?
And that's why I won't feed you after midnight.
Maybe this will teach you not to point.
No doubt... it's a Stranger Thing
Is it me, or has this neighborhood taken a turn for the worst?
See what happens when you don’t heal?
You know how dogs look like their owners, well, he looks like both of us!
My dog sitting service does not cover that sort of event. Goodbye.
Follow your nose, you said.
You can date him once a month and then he's all mine.
That's right it is a monster...but no, its not my boss
You really want me to “go get’m?
You probably shouldn't have peed on him.
Fortunately for Monster Rex is on leash
pointy ears . . . nine lives . . .
Now stop looking at the camera; we have a problem at hand.
yeah yeah - now turn around and let me sniff your butt
OK, since you think it only eats carrion, how do you want to die?
That's what happens to little doggies who have accidents in the house.
It's bark is worse than it's bite.
You are so damned cute when you're not scared!
Wait," "down," and ,"off" are dog commands. I wonder if there's a "bewa[e]re.
He wants to talk to you about shedding.
Remember: You're the one that wanted this walk.
If you think this is freakin' scary, wait until you see your vet bill!
I wish your relatives would call before a visit.
Not one peep from you, Buster!
And I thought you were territorial.
Now you see why we should have abolished the 'Endangered Species Act"
Someone else wasn't afraid of the dark!
C'mon, buddy, his ankles are small and so long as you can contain him 'till the full moon sets, you can pee here tomorrow.
Don't get any ideas about unleashing your inner beast.
It's Mother Nature having a hot flash
A thousand years of breeding should have prepared you for this
I warned you about ignoring the chew toys I give you.
I told you to cut back on the late-night kibbles.
Can we go home now, Jack? Why do you do this? Again, there are no lake monsters.
You're the one who wanted to meet your half brother.
YOU are the result of 55 million years of evolution?!
Well, I guess we can rule out Bigfoot and the Jersey Devil.
Why can't you be more like him?
Relax, you’ll only have to share your water bowl on a full moon.
I wonder where his owner is.
And that's why we can't have children.
Try never to end up like your Uncle Tony
You see what happens when you eat from the table?
This is why I prefer we walk in the park
You're not much of a watchdog, are you?
He may look scary, but he's got a wicked slam dunk
Well, he doesn't seem to be listening to me.  Maybe you can talk him out of eating us.
IT MUST BE "MOONDAY"
This is what comes from ripping off Bernie Wrightson.
I guarantee he's afraid of cats"
I told you Frank, father would return one day.Woof!
Hey rover, should we let him know that costume could give him a serious rash?
Yes you have to wear a leash but you don't have to search everywhere for food, a bed and someone to give you a scratch.
Now you are not Barking?
he says that i will get more out of a best fiend
He's practicing for Halloween
Spike, do you remember this from obedience training?"
Now  I am guessing that the edible I  dropped  in  your  bowl just kicked in because we are standing  in front of a Willow  tree yet you look   like  you  could  squeeze a diamond out right now.
Relax, we're good ! He's a pussy !
Sic ‘em JC
Don’t worry!
We just have to trust him!!
We’ll become him when we are one.
I think you mean "where IS THE wolf?" Speak, indeed, Rufus!
I guess they weren’t underplaying the “one day you will be tested” when we failed that obedience course.
He's your cousin.
Fido, this is one time you'll have to take care of your business at home.
You and your little dog too!
Look him straight in the eyes.
I told you not to scare him! Now we have to wait until he calms down to take him home.
It's just an illusion -- the real monster is waiting for you at home!
Your 401K will do really well!
Not yet, Fang.
Yes, Piper, he needs his nails trimmed- for starters.
I skipped Kimmel for this?
A doodle gone wrong.
You ARE going to clean up after him, right?
This, my friend, is where the two of us part ways.
I thought you just wanted to chase a few squirrels??!
This repetiive dream... here’s the part where I wake up in a flop sweat, because the monsters voice is my mother, threatening to eat my dog if I don’t come over for dinner.
Tippy, it's not fair to you that I gave you my divided attention during our walk. I apologize.  Now can we go home?
And you thought you were having a bad day.
Is this that relative you wanted to invite over for dinner?
Bark. If he chases us, I will look at his feet and we will know for sure.
So your genealogy website states you are related to him, and that's why you keep me up at night howling at the moon
Walking at night is good for you...but your results may vary
Say hello to your cousin
Pretend you don’t know he’s Mr. Henderson, and bark politely.
Not to worry, Jake, it's just Joe Biden off his medication.
Jeez Louise, everybody thinks they're a comedian."
You may want to give a pass on sniffing this one's butt...
It wasn’t even my night to walk the dog.
What are you barking about now?
This is what happens when you eat stuff off of the street
You can be anything if you work hard enough
Pissing it looks like a very bad idea actually...!
Don’t be afraid.  It’s not President Trump.
That's right, Buddy. Nothing to worry about. We saw him in that movie last week on Hulu. Let's go, fella.
I don't think you were descended from him, no matter what paleontologists say.
"Don't just stand there!   Protect me, Poochie. Sic 'em!"
This is yourbancestrt
You see what happens when you pee in the neighbor's yard.
When I said bad dog, I wasn't referring to you.
See what you've done? I told you not to grab food off the coffee table,
I wanted to show why I am cashing in my savings bonds.  I don’t expect you to understand.
Just pee on it again when he's finished.
What the hell!? Have to hold  off on the LSD until after your walk.
He is your son as much as mine, Lola.
Do you want to make a new friend?
Keep it entertained while I go for help.
Didn't you hear me?  I said "sic em".
See what happens when you eat all you yummy dog food?!!
I thought the monster was supposed to be metaphorical.
if you pee on it you'll be kindling
But I can’t let you off the leash.
He gets me up to go in the middle of the night and brings me here to see this. Give me a break."
See that Fido? The absolute nerve of creatures of the night these days...
Fetch," I said, not "Wretch.
Sniff his butt. Everything will be OK.
I don't know what's so confusing.  I told you I got you for protection.
It apparently thinks you are the mailman.
This is not how imagined us meeting your cousin for dinner ...
It's Mr. Rogers of the full moon.
See, This is why I carry that plastic bag
This is a distant cousin from both sides of our family.
You distract him. I'll run for help.
You see how this was risky, right?
Talken to me?
I wander if we could breed him with a poodle?
Looks like Marvin needs a snickers...
This thing can't be any worse than my mother-in-law.
Sic him Toto, like you learned at your doggie kindergarten class.
He says the island soon will be his to pee on, so we can't go there.
Sorry, ol' boy, looks like I've forgotten the doo bag. Drop one real quick and I'll pick it up tomorrow.
This is what happens when you are a bad dog!
It was your idea we should date.
Some day it could be all yours.
Honey, meet my ex.
What does the werewolf say? Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow?
We’re getting you a litter box.
I told you not to insist on Lochness as a stop!
He says your only a snack.  You're not the Chosen One.
Pretzel, meet your second cousin twice removed on your mother’s side.
Are you my daddy?
I said sickum boy  sickum
I'm sorry I - I mean you - drew the short straw.
Sic 'em Poochie!"
You might have evolved to look like that with your common ancestry!
Fido, I'm counting on you.
See Toby this is what happens when you run away
Sic, Fido, Sic!
That is a Monster of Darkness, Skippy, and he ain't going to throw you a puppy chew.
This is why I am not a big fan of ancestry.com.
I don’t care if he’s a distant cousin of yours.
I knew we should never have taken the road less traveled!
I guess it's mommy's turn to be the "cool" parent.
Typical...
Come on man ..you got to be kidding I ordered a hot dog and look at u...grrrr
I hope this isn't what our kids are going to look like.
He says Ancestory.com revealed your related, but he’s not the of  purebred line.
‘’ I don’t want you to get PTSD, so I’m going to let you stare in wonder one more second, and then WE ARE OUT OF HERE.’
Turns out you and I are half brothers.
Oh well, don't worry pal. He's not gonna eat you. He's just vociferous.
Here we go again ...A loose dog, no collar or owner in sight.
Ah wait, here comes the owner,  20 minutes later, wearing his lead & collar around HIS neck!
I'd rather be skimming The New Yorker.
I hate to admit that Tucker Carlson may have been right for once.
Now that's a hound!
Go, get it Bravo.
Your mark, your fight.
And that, biggles, is how I met your mother.
Bark, stupid.
If I'm gonna die, at least I'm dying with my dog who still chews up all my shoes. Don't look at me like that, I've had you for 5 years and you still won't stop! Hey, Mr. Werewolf guy! You agree with me here, right?
I think he’s just auditioned for Hadestown.
No worries, his bark is worse than his bite.
Alright, this week I'll definitely swing by the vet's office for a new pack of flea treatment.
Remember when I would say, 'his bark is worse than his 
bite?' Not this time!
You may not come from a family of good boys, but you can change that.
Don't fall for that dog treat line. He tells all of the cute little dogs that 'Hello Moon'  fiction.
Nice try. This comfort dog does not work.
Zoinks, Scoob.
Why can’t I just walk my dog in peace for once without running into my ex.
I wish my neighbor also complied with the leash law.
And they say we should save the environment.
It comes down to this ol' boy. I know I can run faster than you
Just wait until you meet my relatives.
Was it really worth it to chase that squirrel?
I don't see a problem.  He only wants to join us for lunch.
You always bark loudly to frighten the mailman away. Why aren't you trying to scare this guy?
It's a little derivative.
Why can't you be ferocious like that?
The way you're sniffing so much, it makes it seem as if there's a giant there or something.
Welcome to Cosmetic World.
To think it's only 30,000 years since dogs domesticated the Wendigo.
Where's your big dog bark now that you're closer?
You really should have better role models.
I can't remember if I gave you your anti psychotic medications this morning
You really should go easier on your water bowl.
I told you not to mess with that cat!
Your collar is made of silver... Don't be afraid, attack.
Uh. you are way beyond meat.
Come on Tiger do your thing!
See what happens if you eat that expensive dog food.
I told you, you take after your mother.
(TNY DEV TEST) Mon Aug 19 2019 17:09:16 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)
No, it's just pollution.  You'll get used to it.
You told me you'd turn into one, too -- not a dog!
I knew we should have bought a goldfish.
No bark, Bailey.
Bark three times. Then sit.
see... this is what happen when you are not a good boy!
You were the one who stayed in the car at the Doggie Self-Defense School.
This really beats the Hamptons.
You're my best friend, right? And what do best friends do, they take care of their best friends.
They said there might be coyotes.
If you don't behave yourself,you'll end up his lunch!!!
This is Melvin. He looked just like you before keto
Run the economics, Max. 
 You're on a leash.  He's on a retainer.
Dump behind the couch one more time and he starts earning his pay.
What are you looking at? It's his dog.
Howlin' the hell could this surprise you on a full-moon night?
Good dog! That pop-up certainly looks like the real thing, but it isn't.
Well if this doesn't scare the crap out of you this walk is over!
Why do you need to bring your family in every time we disagree?
Don't worry, he doesn't want to eat you. He's just test driving the latest electric scorched earth skateboard.
Is this really where you need to walk today?
Do you think this is the result of the legalization of weed?
So, do you remember all the food you thought I was just giving you?
Yes, I know it is not in your job description, but budgets are tight.
This is the last Clear the Shelter client...
Shh, don't bark.  It's just a monster, not another dog.
This is why we always stay in the small and shy dog area, buddy.
It's just a tree.
Don't tell me being man's best friend is all hype.
Don't worry.  We don't believe in these things any more.
Well, go on and do your business. We haven't got all day!
The smile radiates love for you.
Now, Rover, don't get ideas.
He's your cousin and my uncle.
It’s ok. His bark is worse than his bite.
I was following you
Yeah, his butt smells just like everybody else’s.
Well Spot, looks like another hot day in foggy bottom.
This is the meaning of incongruous.
No, my patronus is the enemy of the people.
NO! If you can't kill it, I can't cook it!
Yeah, he's trying to terrify us, but he doesn't know the world today has beaten him to it, Hot...
It's a bad omen, and one of us has to has to handle it!
That’s you Great Uncle Lucifer. I know he looks scary but he’s just from Trump’s wish list in Utopia.
It's OK ... he knows you're not a marshmallow.
I’d advise against a #metoo moment with her
The Jets could use him on defense.
You can take him, Freddie; he's more afraid of you than you are of him.
Whatever you do, don't look him in his eyes.
He feeds on fear - remember we are stronger together.
Bite him in the ankle but don't hurt him.
I forgot to tell you that my mother in law was coming today.
Don't look at her that way. Can't you see she's not your type?
Heel Buddy, he's not filled with ​complete and balanced nutrition that provides all that you need.
Gee: Look at his tiny feet!
Don't be scared.  It's just my uncle Dracula.
If you want to pet him, my dog's friendly … and lucky for you, inclusive to all animals.
At least he stays on command.
Stay!  He's just trying to scare you!
Dude.  I’m a rescue.  I used to eat your kind for lunch.
What is there about [Sic 'EM] that you don't understand?
Do you want to go say Hi?
On the bright side, you'll have plenty of bones to bury.
I said beauty, not beast!
don't worry, it's just a lawn ornament.
Did Max misbehave again last night?
He wouldn’t  fetch
Don't bark.
This is what happens when you get picky about your food.
Clearly not a postal worker then?
Oof, was that you again Sparky? You've got to lay off all that peanut butter!
Dad, my vote is to ignore. Yours?
Remember when I got that Ancestry DNA  kit?
No worries....I didn’t check your DNA for relatives.
I don’t think you know what beastiality means
Sik him, Fluffy!
Unbelievable, I know.  But Ancestry confirms it.
That's weird, I just got the exact same feeling I get when I watch the news.
So are you gonna sniff it’s asshole or what?
Daddy needs a cute puppy to help confront his demons.
I told you there was nothing to bark about.
it not the only new Transhuman with AI, others coming around the corner."

Hans M Sass, Reston V
You just tell him to go pick on someone his own size.
A Furry Con must be in town tonight.
And they thought only human needed therapist!
You just had to go out once more.
Remember your training.
Mommy hates to pee in public.
Are you going to protect me or just stand there and stare!?
Don’t worry. When he takes off that costume he’s just a chihuahua.
Don’t be afraid. He’s just trolling you.
Come on baby, aren't you going to defend your Master?... Bark or growl, make a move, I'm waiting
Now do you feel more ready to go to the vet?
Settle down. He won’t be your type in the morning.
For the third time, he's not your father!
Hmmm, “beware the moon & stick to the road”, I get it now...
I told you not to drink the water"
Cheryl Campagne, New Hartford, Con
Oh no!
Don’t worry about the full moon Max.  It’s Donald Trump thinking his hair looks great, expecting some big ratings, and ready to say a few off the cuff remarks.
I'd like you to meet your father.
Hey, didn't you see the signs to "Leash Your Dog?"
Now you know why I take you to the vet.
Yes, you were a werewolf wolf --in a previous lifetime.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you *will* be a real dog.
He gets this from your side of the family. (Please note this caption assumes that the man and dog are married, and that the wolfman is their child).
See what happens to you when you're not a Vegan.
You ask how I got here, and I assure you the day started as any other. Now, Rex (that's the doe-eyed ball of fluff you see beside me) isn't quite the young pup he once was, but today...
You criticize the furry fandom, but did you know the oldest figurative art ever made featured anthropomorphic animals? I think it is conceivable that there is something in furries that the shaman of old had, some primal animalistic affinity. Anyway,
What no bark? Not benign enough for you?
don't bark, you'll frighten him
Go chase it away, girl!
You’re not what I expected when I rubbed the rock
Is it me, or is this relaxing nature walk turning into something less than rejuvenating?
O.K., in all the horror movies the 'good dog' protect his master from the monster.  And don't be the unaccompanied guy who goes to the remote cabin for a 'relaxing weekend.'
Yes he's my cousin but by the looks of it he's yours too
Don't sweat it. The Lake Ness Monster doesn't eat hot dogs.
Nice timing on the walkie, Fido.
Tom Potter: "Sand your ground. I think he's ready to back down.  Stephen West:  This is what happens to bad little dogs who chew their masters' slippers.
That's not a Buick!
See! I told you if you bit Harry Bliss this would happen!
He's MY spirit animal,not yours!
Sorry, Mr. Pompom—she’s got better shading and attention to detail in the lines of his fur, so I’m trading you in. She’s Mr. Pompom now.
We have got to get your dad a new mattress.
so he's a bull-bear, and you're an otter? am i doing this right? hahaha wow this is all so daddy.
I thought you're a protection dog.
This is why you need firm behavioral limits, Toby.
Don’t be fooled. It’s only August.
Horatio... "supernatural curse" is a crutch. No one made him drop out of obedience school.
Go on, Sic-em!
I know I promised you'd see Nessie.
So much for your imagination. There's no one there.
Forget it.  You’d barely be an appetizer.
This is how the tree felt all of those times you peed on it.
Aw, come on!  He's all growl and no bite.
Sic'em. Sic'em. Sic'em.
I know, he's not like us. He never brings his pooper scooper.
If you manage to sniff his butt, wag twice if it's Bill Wishmire; I have $40 on him in the pool.
mmmmm...that's a tasty little morsel
Some overly long caption, maybe political,  which is vaguely humorous
I need to start taking my psychic more seriously.
Remember that Rope-A-Dope thing I mentioned?
Brown acid flashback!
Talk to him; he broke the tie on the leash law.
It's not TV, it's HBO
There's enough meat in that thing to feed a small dog for a year.
Great - I forgot the extra large bags for cleaning up after your brother
Do you appreciate what we've done for you?
Smedley,this time,remember,AFTER he reveals the location of his hoard,THEN you can kill him.
Please, decide. If you want to play with him go now. We must come back early today.
Don't be scared, Rusty. It's a friendly cross between a pit bull and a shar-pei.
Sic ‘em or not. Your choice!
Don't worry, it can't hurt you.  It's just a liberal hoax......
I thought you were trained to recognize someone in need of emotional support.
Boy, I thought I smelled something, but obviously this is worse.
Are you the creature from the Black Lagoon
How's the Puppy Peyote? "  "Kill! "  "Fetch! "  " Even a puppy who says his preyers by night...
See, I told you we shouldn't have gotten a cat.
If you’re seeing what I’m seeing then we’re gonna have a bad time.
Space Jam 2: Air Bud takes on the Monstars
He sheds too much during the full moon.  Prince can't come home with us till tomorrow.
I guess she meant business when she rang the dinner bell
I don't think Duke University... you know, their pitching is rather week this year... The training camp is three miles down there, you'll see the light poles when you get close.
This is the last time I let you take me to one of your family reunions.
Just remember, when the subject comes up, we say we already bought cookies from another Girl Scout.
Sorry master, he smells just like one of us.
See that? No more unprotected lakes for you, Spike.
Please bite me to wake me up from this dream.
Never chase crypto-fauna
Enzo, meet your Uncle , Ferrari . _Judith Morse, Corte Madera, California.
See Toto, now that's a real threat.
If he wants to tickle your chin, just let him do it.
Going Dogging
Be glad you don't have in laws.
He's just jealous.
What do you mean service animals aren’t allowed in hell?
Rex, don't snap at mother-in-law."
I thought you ate that poop.
I've brought you the human sacrifice, now can you make me big and strong like you?
That is your dad!
OK fine, I guess the mailman does owe you an apology.
Told ya this would happen if ya peed on Grampa's tomato plants!
You don’t scare me, I’m an American.
You may be my best friend, but, you know, we bipeds need to stick together.
Is it really what you want to be when you'll get old?
I hear Lucifer is Trump's way of discouraging tourism here at Devil's Den.
Well Spot meet your new owner. You’ll love the way he  scratches behind your ears.
Boy, the cat really got big!
I think we'd better find you a different rock to pee on.
Does he have to ring the doorbell?
You can pee.
It’s only a squirrel. Remember what I said about letting your imagination get away from you.
His poll numbers are in the tank.
YOU DON'T SCARE ME A BIT.  LOOK WHO'S WALKING ME. YOU LOOK KINDA INTERESTING
I'm proud of you for staying. Sorry I can't remember the release cue.
Forget that "fight in the dog" stuff I told you.
Oh shoot, I forgot to bring a plastic bag!
Easy, Rover--the bigger they come the harder they fall.
As Man's best friend, I know he'll defend me.
LaPlace’s demon! Will I get bacon for breakfast tomorrow?
Mom, meet your grandson, Snowball.
It’s that way by the old steel mill.
Believe me, it’s far more terrifying in color.
I would adopt him, but Sparky is better protection.  Sparky's an alpha every night.
He wants access to our Internet account
Really? Now you’re not yapping?
He smells bad.
See, this is what you'll become if you keep pissing in the house.
Mama mia! That's a spicy meatball! And it smells like a spicy aardvark.  Burp! I'm Gary, and I need a cuter dog.
You're a lucky pup, Sandy. Gerational trauma never got to you at all.
C'mon Fido!  What kind of best friend are you if you can't protect me from this fiend?
Sure your quiet now - As I told you, If you Bark at the moon - this monster will eat you!
If your game-- all these "doodle" breeds are so last year.
See Mr. noodles, that’s why we bring you to the doggy groomer.
I should have gotten a pet prenup.
This is what happens when you abandon your master”
Get in the Eva, shinji.
It's a living!
Grandpa, please don't get angry!
This is uncle Maurice -- he shouldda had more dental work.
Don't point! I just thought it might help you 'go'.
They told me you were a purebred werehound.
I KNOW how you hate baby talk.
Why did you have to draw the bull from Where the Wild Things Are? I can't even take my dog on a walk. So unnecessary.
Once again, I did not spike Fe-Fe's dog treats with steroids!
You wussy.
Well, now is the time to earn your pay.
Guess you shouldn't have peed on that one, Boomer.
Oh please. It's more cultural appreciation than appropriation.
It was this or the monsters on the HOA
And this is why you don't beg for table food
Don’t worry he’s all bark and no bite
Darn, I forgot the 16 gallon trash bag for Thunderbeast...
Ut-oh, I didn’t realize we were in the off-leash dog park.
Can't we just go for a walk without you stopping to take photos every second?
Now, if you don't stop pooping in the house, I'll let him have you!
And with enough training, THAT could be you too
What did you think I meant when I said, we were running with the devil?
See? That's what happens when you're taken off puppy food too soon.
This is why you shouldn't think you're human.
So let me get this straight, it’s because only squirrels that give you the creeps?
Should we get you on a new dog food, buddy?
I will trust your instinct.
She is such a show off.
An undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese...that's what we get for switching you to that expensive gourmet paleo dog food.
Don't look at me that way...Nipsy wanted to get a closer look.
why are you not like this guy, pups?
I dunno. If I say "sic 'em," who'll respond?
So THAT’S what she meant by ‘the stars and moon determine your day’
Rover, this, my boy, is the stuff of dreams.
When did our city get rid of leash laws?
Come on Rover!  Finish your job and let’s get out of here
SAY HELLO. I WANT YOU TO MEET YOUR FATHER. HE ATE YOR MOTHER JUST AFTER YOU WERE BORN.
Dog insists I bring him down once a week to wet his appetite.
Great, now he's going to chase after it
Why did I even bother getting a wereschnauzer?
That's not a 'bit of undigested potato.'
And this why you are on a leash.
This is what happens if you don't eat your organic puppy chow...
Red, I do not think this is you long lost grandmother.
Don't worry Pookie, he is all bark and no bite.
This is the last time I walk the dog!

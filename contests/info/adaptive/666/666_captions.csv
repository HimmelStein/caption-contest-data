Lunch is on me.
Dinner's on ME.
Dinner’s on me tonight.
He’s telling his friends it’s not deep. So be patient.
I didn't know what you were serving, so I brought white.
Fresh? Sir, I assure you these were walking on land this morning.
A back massage and then dinner. What's not to like?
It’s like a good wine. You let it breathe before consuming it.
I brought dinner.
It's carryout.
Off Coney Island. There's thousands of them.
I’m letting him sunburn a bit more, I prefer extra crispy.
Once I gave him a name I didn’t have the heart to eat him.
Eat a guy and you'll be full. Use him as bait and we'll all be full.
I got us a politician. There is no backbone !
I swear, it is like the universe does not want me to stay vegan.
I used to feel sorry for them, but this one is wearing a MAGA hat.
Lucky for him this is the last thing on his bucket list.
You want the other half?
He has a name, Dad. It's Greg. And I love him.
When I get hungry, or he realizes I'm not a dolphin, whichever comes first!
It's part of this whole shore-to-table thing.
And I suppose you've never played with your food.
He' s my emotional support animal.
He’s paying an arm and a leg for the ride.
If you liked our food delivery service, please give me 5 stars.
My treat.
I was told we had to bring our own lunch.
So we each grab a leg and make a wish.
Professional courtesy....he’s a lawyer.
I'm letting him take one last selfie.
Jump up and yell, 'I'm that goldfish you flushed!' 
And then we'll eat him."
How did these things ever make it to the top of the food chain?
Last time I ate one this stupid, I was sick for a week.
Yes, I KNOW I'm holding up dinner.
He's never seen the movie
Well, that's embarrassing. How long has it been there?
Seems only fair ,
I ate his surfboard.
This is why they think most shark attacks occur in only three feet of water.
You go ahead, Frank. SPF 30 gives me heartburn.
‘Hold off a bit. He’s bragging about being “king of the sandbar” to four guys in backwards ball caps.’
Soon, he won't have a leg to stand on.
Another Darwin Award winner.
Found him in the shallow end of gene pool.
He’s locally sourced, and most importantly, cage free!
I just can’t do it without the theme music.”
Just be patient. He’s calling his friends.
Remember when Mom read us that story about how the fox tricked the Gingerbread Man and you said nobody could be that stupid?
When I go low, you go high.
Oh, did you want me to pick up something for you, too?
I love a well-balanced meal, don't you?
First, I gain their trust.
Trust me.  This makes it easier to get all the others into the water.
Luckily the dumb ones taste just as good.
Your order is ready, sir...
Hey, Sam, I’d like you to meet my chum.
On one hand, we have a reputation to uphold.  On the other hand, this shiatsu foot massage really feels good.
He still thinks I'm Flipper.
To be honest, I'm thinking of giving up this Uber thing.
The guy at the bait shop said this could get us a couple lifeguards.
Do you want to see what a big surprise looks like?
I ordered him sunny side up.
He ain’t heavy, he’s my breakfast.
How about some help carrying the groceries?
Fine, but walking him is your responsibility.
Watch this. I'm going to flip it up and catch it in my mouth.
He thinks I'm Flipper, who's Flipper?
When he says "Marco," they all say "Polo,' and then we eat.
I found this mannequin in some ocean trash. It allows me to get closer to shore without alarming my lunch.
I still don't see why the dolphins get such a kick out of this.
Isn't it time we told him he's adopted?
Let’s split the Bill
Excuse me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?
So much for them having a bigger brain.
I’m a certified support animal.
OK, you call it - Heads or Tails?
Are you the one who ordered takeout?
Shhh! He's looking out for sharks.
Shhh...he thinks I'm a dolphin.
I raise my own. It’s the only way to know they’re organic.
I would have eaten him, but I'm finally getting WiFi.
Can we keep him, Mom? Please?
This one's a decoy.  We get the real ones when they come out to rescue it.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
You're more likely to be struck by lightning than be stepped on by a human.
Ability to delay gratification correlates with higher SAT scores and greater success later in life.
One on the fin is worth two on the beach.
It's Hilarious. He thinks I'm a dolphin.
I thought he was a seal, he thought I was a surf board.
It's from that new take-out place under the pier.
Shall we just split an order?
Professional courtesy. Personal injury lawyer.
It seems rude to interrupt while he’s on the phone.
I just think it's a bad idea to eat something this stupid.
If he's gonna have kids as smart as he is, it makes more sense to release him.
Definitely a keeper!  I'd guess about a 180 pounder.
I can't go anywhere without a snack
It's Donald. We don't eat our own.
I ordered wings but they gave me legs instead.
I'm going to be on the evening news.
Heard it’s Trump ... we could become hero’s!
wait till he finds out I'm not his surf board.
He had a standing reservation for dinner.
I'm seventy years old and I'll play with my food if I want to.
I decided to go with carry out.
I brought you a snack.
No thanks. I brought my lunch.
The weirdest part is that the water above me keeps randomly getting warm
I’m trying to eat a more balanced diet.
Millennials act so entitled.
We have a deal.  He tells everyone else it’s safe and I don’t eat him.
It's a new ridesharing company I started. I call it Scuber."
Of course I’ll eat him, but in the meantime  I just love the foot massage.
Of all my anger management exercises, this one is the most difficult
Honey, I brought dinner!
Sometimes it's just too easy.
He's my therapy human.
I read that its best to let meat rest before consuming it.
He’s a rescue.
Don’t bite.My back has never felt so good.
Did you already eat yours?
I liked it better when they were afraid of us.
I work for UberEats now.
This one’s on me.
He's a loan shark-it's a professional courtesy."
It's professional courtesy, he's a lawyer.
He’s only just temporarily on top of the food chain.
Another 20 minutes and he’ll be medium rare.
Don't say anything, he just told all his friends that he's tall enough to reach the bottom.
I am the fin beneath his things.
I thought we'd get take out and watch a movie.
Yes, I could dive, but I think surfacing would be more interesting.
I'm trying to eat a balanced diet
I'm going to let him marinate for another 20 minutes.
It  is the final exam for self control and anger management class
Yeah it's a Great White
The doc said I needed a balanced diet.
I love the look in their eyes when they realize they're not standing on the bottom.
First, we were overfished and now we're support animals?  I don't get it.
Shhh.  This guy thinks I'm a service animal.
He's just a decoy.
I’m making a fortune carrying them into U.S. waters.
One lousy surfer and I get sixteen weeks of community service.
Should we do lunch now or save it for dinner?
I know. But he removed a thorn from my fin”.
I told him I’d give him a lift if he debunked shark attacks as Fake News.
He's trying to get a signal.
Are you a leg or a breast man?
I call it “ Surf and Turf”
I wish I had a blowhole.
Millennials...am I right?
Feels so good I hate to eat him.
I'm headed to the potluck
You smell fear? All I can smell is feet.
Why does the President always have to rely on us to keep him afloat?
We'll eat him right after my back massage.
Just wait till he does another hand stand.
I can't do that.  He's a lawyer.  He's one of our own.
I can’t do anything without the soundtrack.
He was drowning. I'm just keeping him fresh until I get hungry.
Probably not a stable genius.
This guy thinks he walks on water.
I accidentally looked up his trunks... totally lost my appetite.
Don’t worry he’s armless
Let him get his damn selfie first.
You know, it wouldn't kill you to help me carry the groceries.
My ex got the top half.
It’s a professional courtesy. He’s a corporate lawyer.
I'll split him with you.
Takeout is on me tonight.
I think he said "Hey guys, I found the sand bar!"
I REALLY hate Lent!
You were right about President Trump, he really is the dumbest thing on land or water.
Shall we each grab a leg and make a wish?
I just get more done if I bring my lunch to work.
It's a decoy.
I know we said we weren't exchanging gifts this year, but I couldn't resist.
You ordered a 160 pounder, no fins, no wet suit?
He thinks he's standing on a sand bar. I'm waiting for his wife.
Ok, let's go over this again... I hit the brakes, then you open your mouth.
White meat is dry and flavorless, but there's no alternative on Nantucket.
Beginning to have second thoughts on the Uber gig.
You said you wanted fresh.  I'm bringing you fresh.
The invitation said to bring your own lunch
New gig with Uber Eats.
I'm transitioning to porpoise, if you must know.
Too bad today is Catch and Release
It's win win. He gets a free ride, I get a free lunch.
I can’t, he’s a client.
I identify as a Dolphin.
It’s a comfort human.
He’s all yours. I can’t stomach another old white male.
I like to play with them a little beforehand. Don't tell Mom.
Something is in the water. Oh my god, it just touched me!
I dunno--I heard the guy say, "Less crowded than Everest and twice as safe."
Sometimes being a vegetarian is difficult
I know it’s a false sense of security, but the meat is more tender when they’re relaxed.
Here's your order.
He's a lawyer. Professional courtesy.
My wife said to bring someone home for dinner.
Here's your take-out. That'll be 20 clams.
They're all over the place. Go get your own.
He said he'd introduce me to his fat uncle.
They call him the shark whisperer.
It's called Great White Privilege.
I’ll wait until he finishes waving at his wife.
So who's on top of the food chain?
No, go ahead, you tell him
The most embarrassing part is he keeps calling me "Flipper".
Why?  What do you use as bait?
Go away, you already had your half ...
It’s times like these that I regret going vegan.
I’m seconds away from nipping this wildlife tourism trend in the bud.
They're like muffins. The top half is delicious.
It started as a joke, but now I'm sorta invested.
I brought take out.
Man, this Swim With The Dolphins racket is great -- look what I got!
I'm not hungry right now, but it's like packing a lunch for later.
When eating out got so expensive I started packing my lunch.
I like the top a little crispy.
Say hello to my little chum.
He's keeping an eye out for sharks
Suppers on me!
Don't say a word. I'm trying not to laugh.
Heads he's yours.  Tails he's mine.
The kids wanted takeout again.
He's my chiropractor.
Do you have any grey poupon?
All I know is the sciatica in my caudal fin is gone completely.
Don't show your fin! He thinks he's riding a dolphin!
Since when don't you like Italian?
Of course this happens the week I go vegan
The water taxi costs an arm and a leg. I said I'd charge just an arm.
First, you have to give them a false sense of security.
Let's wait until he's finished waving to his kids.
People keep coming to try and rescue him. I swear, I've never eaten so good in my life.
Let him finish taking his selfie.
Let's humor him until his wife and kids arrive.
Turns out, you can play with your food and eat it too.
You try it ,the last one I ate tasted  just like chicken.
I thought you said I was supposed to bring lunch.
On three?
Wait 'til he finds out I'm not a dolphin.
Like I told you, Karen, men will walk all over you if you let them.
Hey, Frank, dinner’s on me, today.
My mom finally said I could have a pet - he's a rescue.
I'm gonna give this Uber thing another week.
I'm sick of white meat.  YOU eat it!
He's my comfort human, Larry
And just like that, goodbye sciatica.
Oh, like you could say no to Sir David Attenborough.
What is it you're not supposed to do, 30 minutes after eating a swimmer?
...and we'll have these waters to ourselves for the rest of the summer.
You take the left leg and we’ll make a wish.
Thigh or drumstick?
Now I have athlete's fin
Tell the kids, dinner's ready
Met him at Montauk.  Twenty bucks to take him to Sag Harbor ain't bad.
Let one swimmer go and they walk all over you!
It's my emotional support human.
He ain't heavy, he's my lunch.
Tastes like chicken.
I don’t know, I think he said his name was Spielberg and I owe him big time....
Oh, it's Human Week.
I’m never sure of what to bring to potlucks.
Ooh gross, get it off!! Where is it?
They are all so confident when their head is above water.
What is it? Get if off me! Get it off!
You know what they say..."eat a man and you have lunch,  use one as bait and you'll feast forever"
I met him online.
I was going to let him finish his text.
We're pool sharks..live with it.
I’m letting him marinate
I told you I was bringing the entree!
I feel like a metaphor for the Mueller report.
Bait. I’m trolling for one of the really fat, juicy ones.
Why don't YOU ever bring dinner?
Jump the shark? No, but he did stick the landing.
You know that trick where the dog flips a treat up off his nose and then eats it?
It started off as a wart
What can I say, he’s a lawyer. He’s one of us.
I told him I'm a dolphin.
Well, if I had known your sister was joining us, I would have brought home more than just the drumsticks.
Gives a whole new meaning to "stupid" doesn't it?
Wanna grab a bite?
I'd eat him, but he's doing wonders for my back.
Let's let him wave frantically to shore for another minute or two.
That's Donald Trump - much, much scarier than showing my dorsal fin above the water.
Uber Eats delivery for you
I tried goat yoga. This is better.
No, when you're a shark, you're not necessarily a shark all the way.
Imagine how he'll spin this for his college essay.
The trick is to brine just the bottom half
No, maybe YOU misunderstood when he said "Help, shark!"
Hurry, go get the camera.
I thought he'd realize his mistake and jump off, but it's been three hours and now it seems too awkward to say anything.
This is NOT how He walked on water.
Sorry I'm late. But I brought lunch.
I'm saving him for later.
Ok, I am going to flip him".   Heads or Tails
We Canadian sharks are just too polite.
He thinks they're swimming with dolphins.
Why don’t you bring a sea weed salad or bottle of red wine.
Revenge is a dish best served live.
Great white privilege...
Have at him. I gave up men for lent.
I feel like a Golden Retriever with a Cheerio on its nose.
I'm on my way to a potluck.
The missus asked me to get some takeout.
Chick bait.
I got a lunch order here for a Miss Wanda Piranha. Is that you?
He’s just taking a selfie.  Then we can eat him.
He's my chum.
I couldn’t finish the whole thing, so I got it to go.
Why does this always happen when I'm fasting?
I give up.  What has two legs and looks tasty for lunch?
Watch this!  He thinks he’s on a sand bar.
Does the tag say “sell by” or “use by”
Go ahead they taste like chicken.
He's half the man he used to be.
I believe you ordered take-out.
I got some takeout from that new sand bar.
Do you prefer the thigh or leg?
This has been a bad week, one Fitbit, two tires and now a stand up comedian.
I stopped for take-out on my way home.
I promise. This is his last selfie.
40 more hours of community service, and I can go back to biting ‘em.
I grabbed us take-out.
Do I have food on my face?
He does things for me you can't begin to understand.
Are you gonna tell him? Or should I?
I got takeout tonight
It attracts the lifeguards, and they don't come any meatier than that!
He's my perfect disguise ... keeps all the tastier swimmers from panicking  when they see my dorsal fin.
'I won't eat him right away. My back feels great.'
The wife is working late, so she asked me to bring home dinner.
Best spa ever. Back massage followed by dinner for two.
It's low-pay, seasonal work. But it includes meals.
I am so sick of tourist season - you can have this one.
I ate his wife.  It's the least I could do.
Because he's a card shark, and I owe him a fin."
Yeah, I've got your Uber Eats order.
Your Uber Eats order, sir.
I thought I'd get a massage in before lunch.
I was running late, so I got my meal to go.
Are you the guy who ordered dinner?
he thinks he found a sandbar
He’s my chum, not yours.
Grab a leg, and make a wish....
At the count of three, we each grab a leg and make a wish.
I know, but my doctor told me to just leave it alone and eventually it'll fall off.
It's even better than goat yoga.
The worst part is, I just ate.
I think it’s a great white.
I know, you hate it when I play with my food...
I don’t care how much good publicity we need, this is humiliating.
Pretty soon this guy won't have a leg to stand on.
Do stupid people taste good?
You the guy who ordered the sushi?
Uber Eats
My wife sent me for takeout.
I have to wait for that music to start.
When should I tell him I am not a dolphin?
It works like a charm to catch lifeguards
Remember this is an aquarium - eat him and there is no more
Trust me, it'll be funnier AFTER he realizes...
It's the only way to get that knot out of my back.
Surf and Turf
He's all yours.  I can't eat anything this stupid.
I'm just gonna ride this one out.
I enjoy giving them a false sense of security.
I'm seriously thinking I should say something.
His name is Jesus and he likes it when people think he can walk on water.
Do I LOOK like a dolphin?
Take a bite and tell me if it tastes like chicken.
I just don't feel like I command the respect I used to.
Like Donald Trump, he thinks he is on solid ground.
He's a lawyer. It's a professional courtesy.
Can I keep him?
It’s harder than goat yoga and it comes with a snack.
Tourists ...its too easy
It's a matter of perception vs. reality.  He thinks I am a log and I know he is my lunch.
I don't mind. He's waving a 'Save the Sharks' poster.
I find it makes the other swimmers more relaxed.
My dermatologist isn't worried about it, but I want a second opinion.
He's picking up plastic.
It's not how I imagined global warming either, but here we are.
I'm trying to quit, but they make it too damn easy."
God, I hate being a Nurse Shark.  This guy says he has bunions.
'It takes a lot of self control, but I am getting a great massage.'
It feels so good I just couldn't eat him.
I'm a comfort shark...
You go high, I'll go low.
He's not heavy. He's my lunch.
Well, then, you should have asked for fries when you placed your order.
He's not heavy. He's my dinner.
It’s all about branding.  If we save one once in a while, we’ll be right up there with the dolphins
It's a shame we have to throw them back if they are under three feet.
Be my guest, I can't reach him.
Do you think he knows that he's taking the last selfie of his life?
The top half was delicious.
It's take your dinner to work day.
She can't complain it's not "fresh" this time!
Tee hee.  He thinks I’m inflated.
They’re delicious, but they need air.
The wife likes her takeout fresh
Don't ask.
What, do I have something in my teeth?
It's my spirit animal.
When I show my dorsal fin above the water they all run screaming, but with this sunburned mannequin they never see me coming.
Its Spielberg
The odds of this occurring are roughly the same as getting struck by lightning.
It's bring Your Victim to Work Week."
My new workout?  Strength training until failure, then a high protein snack.
I didn't know they delivered.
I like to eat a balanced diet.
I owe him, He pulled a hook out of my tail years ago
I'm looking for some fava beans and a nice chianti.
Call me Fishmael.
Actually, I do like working for Uber.
It's called "take out".
It's like he knows I'm fasting.
He's out of his depth and clueless. Sad.
I don't know, it's some kind of parasite.
Are you the one who ordered from Grubhub?
What kills me is he thinks he’s the great white.
No, papa, I love him!
Don't let this get around.
Just my luck. Every time I go on a diet...
Does this thing make my dorsal fin look weird?
Best. Disguise. Ever.
I saved you the bottom half."
Oh my God, where is it?  On my back?  Don't kill it, just get it off me!
I'd eat him but I've never had such a good massage before.
Let's make a wish.
He says the cell signal is better out here.
Don’t pretend like you’ve never seen live bait before.
I picked up some take-out.
He’s looking for us!
It's a balanced diet.
The legs taste better after marinating for an hour.
I'm taking it to the potluck.
Care to join me for take-out ?
You wanna tell him? Or should I?
I'm saving the rest for later
Whatever it is he's trying to prove, he's not going to have a leg to stand on.
I heard Everest just got too popular for them.”
If he likes the ride, I get five stars on Kelp.
What?? Do I have something caught in my teeth?
I know, never get attached to them, but this one is different.
No, I wouldn't say I let people "walk all over me"
Because a real periscope costs an arm and a leg.
No, you _can't_ have the top."That's the best part.
Remember, I said to pack a lunch...?
Should you tell him or should I?
Here’s your order sir!
I know we shouldn't play with our food, but this seems to help my back.
Do I have some food stuck in my dorsal fin?
let's do the old bait and switch.
I can never resist playing with my food.
Relax, he's just saying his goodbyes.
I'm taking him out for lunch.
Want half?
He keeps yelling “help!” Do you think there’s anything we can do for him?
I'll let him post to Instagram first.
I don't have the heart to tell him I'm not a dolphin
What can I say - I like to play with my food.
I brought dessert.
I got my sea legs.
I think it's time to show ol' Macheath here our pearly whites.
I like mine golden brown on top.
No you can’t have him.  I’m delivering for GrubHub.
Join the aquarium they said,
It'll be fun they said
Business has really picked up ever since the ferry boat broke down.
How do you want him- over easy?
I prefer dark meat. He's all yours.
I don’t eat white meat.
Took him 'to go'
He's all yours. I'm not big on white meat
I found a really good take out place right on the beach...
They call it Extreme Paddleboarding.
I call it lunch.
And somehow this isn't the scariest platform in America.
He said he was going to get me featured on Shark Tank.
I'd eat him, but it's so hard to find a good shiatsu practitioner and he knows just the right pressure point on my dorsal.
I know we don't normally get aggressive, but this guy is pissing me off.
Sure, but when one of us mistakes a surfboard for a seal, all hell breaks loose.
It’s Ramadan.
A lot has changed since I became a vegetarian.
Dad said he could clear a whole beach in the mid-70s
He’s not my friend, really more of a chum.
Let's wait another sec, .   .   .   he still thinks he's on his buddy's shoulders.
I know, I know. I just don’t have the heart to tell him I’m not a dolphin.
I’ve just about had it with being his companion animal.
I'm with Uber. If they don't tip, I eat them.
These new lures are a hit.
So, what are you doing to improve our image?
The Great White suggests allowing the meat to stand just a bit prior to consumption.
I am trying to make him feel what it’s like to be endangered.”
I try to maintain a balanced diet.
I'm saving the legs for dessert.
Shhh! He thinks he’s standing on a rock.
He’s a lawyer and 23andMe says we’re related.
What he doesn't know is about to hurt him.
Quick, take a photo for my Instagram!
Yep, another adrenaline junkie followed me home.
I had to do something—Dolphins are killing us in the PR department!
So what? You've got ramoras.
May I borrow your Grey Poupon?
I can't believe I missed and ate his surfboard.  I think I need glasses.
I brought my lunch.
He's bait, you idiot!
I'm tired of all the hate
Stick around! I am using him as bait!
I gave up eating idiots for Lent.
Can you please get a picture of this?
I thought it was potluck.
Yoo-hoo. My eyes are down here.
It’s a long trip. Thought I’d carry a snack  for the road”
Be patient. He just asked his wife to come in - 
there'll be plenty for both of us.
When I'm through with him, he won't have a leg to stand on.
If we don't nip this in the bud, sharkboardng may become a 'thing'.
I feel so much better since I went vegan.
I bet this idiot thinks he's on top of the food chain right now?
I got this one to go.
I just can't bear to tell him he's really in over his head.
We decided to try that new carry out place.
I wanted to go somewhere nice, you're the one who said let's just get takeout!"
Hey! I didn't criticize you when you brought YOUR lawyer!
They're so tame these days. It's no fun anymore.
The Hamptons have become way too crowded.
Sometimes, I feel like they just don't respect me anymore.
It keeps calling me "Dude".
Meals on Fins!
When do you think we should let him know?
Just stay calm - it’s more afraid of you than you are of it.
I brought a snack in case we get hungry later.
He's my chum or at least will be soon.
I''m saving the bottom half until later
He promised to fix my back. I promised not to eat him.
Oh yeah ! The old sandbar trick, it works every time !
I prefer standing rib, don't you?
He said he was a lawyer...professional courtesy.
Do you think he could balance on ONE leg?
My body, my choice.
It's 2019. We're in love. And it's beautiful.
The dolphin noises worked."
Meet my new chum!
White people, amiright?
Am I losing my edge, Alan?
Bite his leg off, will ya? My dorsal fin's going to sleep.
What was I supposed to do? Let him drown?
Professional courtesy. He's a politician.
I always like to bring a snack.
What? It's Take Your Prey to Work day.
Mom, I'm not going to be ashamed of who I love anymore.
He's a lawyer- it's just professional courtesy
Yeah, he thinks he’s standing on a sandbar.
No, he's just my massage therapist.
He does wonders for my spine.
I still play with my food — so what?
I'm tired of Dolphins getting all the good press.
You don't feel like cooking, so I got some take-out.
Did you order the take-out?
It’s Human Week.
He hasn't yet noticed I ate his surfboard.
I had the top half for breakfast.
I’m swimming for the new ride-sharing app  Scuber”
He thinks I'm a dolphin. What should I do?
Look what followed me home.
Shark surfing, apparently it's a thing.
It's complicated.
Humans endangered species? You must be joking!
i come bearing gifts
Bless us O Lord and these Thy gifts which we areabout to recieve...
I broke his surfboard, it's the least I could do.
Move to Marineland it will be fun, they said.
So you're sayin' he made up the whole symbiosis thing.
What would Darwin do?
Pardon me. Would you have any Grey Poupon?
Did you know shark yoga was a thing?
Do these make my neck look fat?
Pretty soon he won't have a leg to stand on!
It's called 'delayed gratification training.'
I just don't know if I really want to eat him or if it's because society wants me to"
Since when are you concerned about sustainability?
I WAS GOING TO EAT HIM BUT MY BACK NEVER FELT BETTER
I saved this one for you. I'm already stuffed to the gills.
I'd eat him, but I like the back rub.
He's heavy...and he ain't my brother.
I'm still a man eater. Uber is just a side hustle.
I'm just not into him
I'm beginning to rethink this ride sharing gig.
It's a symbiotic relationship.  He gets a free ride, and I get to swim close to shore undetected.
Do you want to surprise him or should I?
So, should I tell him, or do you want to?
Here’s one guy who’s gonna be defeeted.
I don't have the heart to tell him I'm not a sandbar.
It's just easier to carry your lunch.
It's just until he finishes his beer.
I know. But it supposedly cures hiccups.
It's one of my best lures.
I’m full. You want him?
Word to the wise: never lose a bet to Shamu
Fine then, you tell me how to accessorize.
Carryout.
I could only eat half!
It was developed by the same people who came up with goat yoga.
I've literally got lunch on my mind
I'm a Scuber driver.
I switched to using live bait
Surf for him--turf for me.
It's that first moment of realization I savor most, though the panicked thrashing is also quite satisfying.
He's endangered.
I’ve found that strapping a lawyer on my back scares more swimmers than my fin alone.
The top half was pretty tasty.
Fear is a tenderizer.
I'd eat him but he's such a stand up guy.
I do one National Geographic Special and he's been following me around ever since.
It's realistic, isn't it? Now lets see if it works...
It's a balanced breakfast.
Dinner’s almost ready - just letting it rest for a few minutes
I don’t have the heart to tell him he’s not swimming with dolphins.
I was going to eat him, but this massage feels fantastic.
I want to tell him "a little to the left" but I'm afraid he'll freak out.
Somehow  he thinks I'm taking him back to his surfboard.
I always carry a snack with me when I’m out and about.
I've seen better legs on a hermit crab.
It looks like it's white meat for dinner. Do you prefer the leg or the thigh?
It's strickly business. For luring them over to me, he keeps any jewelry and cash.
I named him Finn.
Watch me flip him in the air and catch him in my mouth
Do I have some food on my fin?
There are days  I wish I never would have  gotten involved with Uber!
It's the least I could do since I ate his surfboard .
As my sponsor can you help me with how to react or handle this situation? The urge to eat him is so strong.
His surf, our turf.
Now I understand why the oceans are warming.
I thought I’d  do carry out this evening.
He's just some guy from Helsinki. Calls himself a dorsal Finn.
I'm taking my lunch to work today.
Some moron ate his surfboard
Yeah, I’m embarassed, but it feels so good.
It's Ramadan.  He has until sundown.
I told you they'd try to domesticate us next.
This is what white privilege looks like.
It's a good decoy, but the glue gives me hives.
They taste better after you betray them.
'"Wait 'til he says Polo."
I had him stuffed and mounted as a trophy.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do regret going Vegan.
Yeah, it looks annoying, but after he does his job, it's like a big buffet.
I decided to get carry-out from the beach.
What?  He's my emotional support human.
I really don't like white meat.
I just love climate change.
Shh! He thinks I'm a sandbar. Don't spoil the surprise.
Zero respect since Jaws.
Professional courtesy - he's a lawyer.
I'd eat him but I don't want to ruin my rideshare rating.
Today's beach buffet is standing room only.
Karma’s a bitch.
I picked up dinner
He says his name's Jonah
I have to stay still. He's already been calling for more friends to come play at the "sandbar".
They taste terrible but you should see the look on their faces when they find out I’m not a rock
Don't knock it. This lure works much better than a bare fin.
I know, right? Second day as a vegan and already I'm being tempted.
I'd eat him but I think he was farm-raised.
It's an Androcles and the lion relationship. He pulled a plastic straw out of my gills.
Yea, I got approved to have an emotional support human.
I know you're not supposed to play with your food, but I can't help myself.
Would you get this guy off my back?
I'm just waiting for the rest of the beach crowd to think it's shallow water
Wanna split it?
You could've at least brought dessert.
It lulls them into a false sense of security.
I'm taking home the leftovers.
I carry him with me in case my blood sugar drops and I have to eat something quick.
Want to help me ruin the summer tourist season?
I bought it on sale, it was Half Off.
I just ate his wife, it's the least I could do.
In about one minute, he won't have a leg to stand on.
He says we can’t close until your lawyer is here too.
You gotta stop letting people walk all over you, Jeff
The recipe calls for fifteen minutes of brining.
This guy figures he's a shoo-in for the 2019 Darwin Award.
Let him take a few selfies first.
It stands for Make America Great White Again.
Did the water just get really warm?
It's a new game called 'Survival of the Idiot.'
I think they call him a sociopath--he acts like he is drowning and I get the rescuers.
Wanna join me for lunch?
I'm on the low ph diet. So I'll wait until he's finished peeing before I eat him.
Here is your carry out
My chiropractor said it’s good for my aching cartilage.
Of all the days to go vegan.
We're both warm blooded, but he's a lot dumber.
He’s started talking about his divorce and I just don’t have in me.
He has my back so don’t bite him
The invitation said "bring a dish to pass."
What, do I have food all over my face?
Remember, it’ll take lots of responsibility to take him on walks every day.
I just like the top part.
Normally I'd eat him, but this just feels sooo good.
Suzanne ate the top half.
I haven't yet had the appetite to tell him he lost his surfboard a few meters back.
I can’t, it’s too easy.
I think my vegan diet days are just about over.
Please tell me those are feet.
Ready?
No, no. On Fridays we can eat meat...
I’m sorry I am late but I picked up dinner on the way home.
Mr, Magoo here thinks I am a surf board.
I didn’t invite him. I thought you did.
And he's eating a tuna fish sandwich
If you wanted a fresh packed lunch Morty you should have brought one.
I know! But his feet are really warm and, when he falls off, well, lunch!
It's a great decoy. . .works like charm every time!
We do have a standing date for lunch, don't we?
Help yourself. I'm vegan.
tourist...am I right?
For my birthday I wished to grow another 2 feet.
There are times I just wish I could forget I'm a vegan!
I’m trying something different.  I’m letting my food play with me.
Well, the sharks in Japan say it helps with their back pain.
Don't you try to shame me into sharing just because you forgot to pack a lunch.
Like the American electorate, he does not know he’s standing on a shark
It’s a condition of my parole, to prove that I can resist temptation.
The key is to give them a false sense of security.
Money got a little tight so I signed up to be an Uber shark.
Gross. Callouses.
Sometimes I like to play with my food before I eat.
I ate the other half.
It's white male privilege
He's taking a selfie right now, isn't he?
He's just finishing up his goodbyes.
I'm saving the bottom half for later.
Get your own hood ornament!
Its an exercise in delaying gratification
Sometimes, it’s just too damn easy.
He's here to get a loan,
But you said to bring lunch
It’s a SHARK TANK audition.
Quick question. Can I get sick from eating someone who's "going viral"?
Of course I bring my own lunch.
I was saving him for later.
Do I look like a surfboard? I don't feel like a surfboard.
Half a billion years old and the planet’s most vicious predator - where’s the respect?
AH! What is it? Where is it? Get it off!
I need to work on my fear of confrontation.
It's just professional courtesy.  He's a lawyer.
I work for Uber now...
Hang on a minute. He’s almost worked out that knot.”
Human Week is the worst.
I'm sick of you looking at me like I'm a piece of meat, Kyle."
April Fools!  I ate the top half!
They call it shark-surfing. Want to help teach him a lesson?
This kind of thing only happens now that I'm vegetarian.
I ate the top half. I'm full. You want the rest?
Professional courtesy, he's my lawyer.
I'll give you an arm and a leg if you can knock him off my back.
Right now, I'm playing with my food
It's called Ashiatsu, and it's heaven... so don't even think about it.
WAY too skinny for me. 
You want him?
I'm gonna charge an arm and a leg for this.
It’s Spielberg. Again.
I packed my snack for the trip.
I'm saving the leftovers for tomorrow.
Well, I would eat him, but he's scratching that itch even my remoras can't get to.
I know what you’re thinking but it kinda feels good.
You have no idea what this anger management class has done for me!
He claims to be a pilot fish.
I ate his surfboard and felt bad about it.
Back off. He’s my chum.
Bro, You can't eat him. It's Steven Spielberg!
I wouldn’t mind so much if he cut his toe nails.
It's a lure for boaters. I call it 'Bob'!
Hors d'oeuvre?
You go ahead.  I'd prefer some finger food.
Augh, I caught it in NY. Long Island Sound is totally infested this time of year.
K. F. Sea had a special on their Thighs and Legs.
The tourists are here!
Those idiot resort dolphins talked me into this.
When you have kids, you'll know it's always important to carry some snacks with you.
Look,I saved HALF for you!
What? Do I have something stuck in my teeth?
The dermatologist said it was benign.
So anger management is going well.
Can you see if he's wearing a Yankees hat?
The skinny ones aren't as tender, but they usually have fewer preservatives.
I'm his Emotional Support Animal....but you're not.
I swear, if they give dolphins credit for this, I'm eating the next one.
I invited him to dinner. I don't think he quite understood the repercussions.
They are dumber than I thought
My lawyer got the charge reduced to an “investigatory bite” provided I go through a tourist tolerance course
I brought carry-out.
I was an extra in Sharknado 6.  True story.
“These millennials are so entitled.”
Less scary when it's not a fin sticking out of the water
I always wanted a periscope,
He thinks I’m a dolphin.
Yeah, I know, but I’m hoping he has a beer gut.
He's a lawyer.
I got mine to go.
I just ate the top half, it scares the daylights outta them!
I brought dinner home.
Once again, looks like you got more of it on you than in you.
Working for Uber is so so, but the tips are pretty tasty.
Is he wild or farm raised?
Give a shark a man and it eats for today. Teach a shark to lure other men and ... well you get the idea.
Best.decoy.ever.
Sometimes they're just asking for it.
No, I'm actually a hammer toe
Watch this. If a dog can do it with a treat on his nose...
Tell me honestly, do you think I have started to lose my killer instinct?
Yeah, so I’ve been Uber-ing on the weekends.
I like to fool people into thinking this is the shallow end of the pool.
I got it through Amazon.  You blow it up and they can't see your fin.
He’s waving frantically, right?  Good.  His friends will arrive soon and then we’ll REALLY have a feast.
They say if I stop swimming he’ll die.
I told you vacationing at Sea World would be a mistake.
I’m waiting for my musical cue.
Well, I guess I'm just more of a people pleaser than you.
Do you smell something?
He’s working on a hamburger up there. I’m trying to fatten him up.
All I could find for lunch was this take-out
I'm telling you, it's Spielberg.  He's casting Son of Jaws and wants to see what I can do.
Why do I always end up carrying all the groceries in?
You go ahead...they get stuck in my teeth.
When the rides over, he'll know it.
Which leg do you want?
Trust me; this is the most humane way.
He scratches the spot I can't reach.
Apparently we're serial predators and need to create a less-hostile beach environment.
I've been waiting on you.  Which leg do you want.
Da dumb, da dumb, da dumb
He promised me a part in a movie.
Of course it's degrading.  But Sea World auditions, here I come.
Don't ask. He's an admissions officer at USC.
Now you jump the human.
I got the patch. I'm trying to quit.
Did I mention he is now topless.
Say what you will, but I believe finding a friend trumps finding a meal.
Strong under-toe this time of year, huh?
He thinks I'm a lone shark.
If you don’t attack first, they think they can just walk all over you.
This is so embarrassing. Tell the dolphins we want to switch back.
My therapist says I'm a little too empathetic.
It was my turn to bring lunch, wasn't it?
The massage is very relaxing, but I'm looking forward to the happy ending.
I told you Felix, you have to eat at least one or they’ll walk all over you.
Yeah, but my back has never felt better."
He's so asking for it.
I don't know why. Some guy named Jesus asked me to do this.
With this stunt, I think we've finally jumped the shark!
I'm a victim of  compassion
Well, you know the old expression,
"Ignorance is bliss- until it's not."
Has he never seen Jaws?
Don't eat him till he finishes rubbing my back.
Everyone has baggage.
He's my old chum.
No, bull sharks are the aggressive ones, I’m more passive aggressive.
Dinner will be ready in fifteen …
Today's special is the Surf and Turf
Flip for it?
Looks like you get the bottom half.
You ordered a medium,with no anchovies,right?
He’s on his mobile. Doesn’t realize the sand bar is now moving
The secret is to brine the legs.
What really irks me is that if our positions were reversed, they'd harpoon my ass.
The ‘swim-with-the-sharks’ folks have  really become entitled.
Of course I'm not happy with this relationship. I always have the feeling he's looking out for something better.
It's crazy, but he looks out for me.
“Some body’s a little more than knee deep 
                  in troubled waters.”
I hate it when they take all the challenge out of it.
You were late, so it’s Take Out.
I've been swimming for Swyft a few months now, and posting reviews of my clients on Gulp.
Why do I always have to carry the decoy?
And me without my Grey Poupon.
Sure, I could eat him, but as an Uber driver I can't really afford the lower rating."
I'm gonna swish this guy right offa my fin, and send him on his way."
Want to hear about my new balanced diet?
He's lucky I already ate a quarter flounder for lunch
But he's nothing but skin and bones!
I don't like their taste, but I love the naïveté.
Do you prefer the breast or the thigh?
Market price is $8.99/lb.
Don’t worry about fixing dinner. I brought home takeout.
I had a hat like that last week.
Ew! Get it off me, get it off me!
I need to learn to use the word “no” more often.
Our deal: Skinny lawyer calls for help and we eat tender lifeguard.
You bring the salad, I’ve got the main course
You’re my witness. This one was provoked.
I think he’s confused me with a dolphin.
He thinks I'm his attorney.
I like to play with my food first.
His balance is unnerving.
I always use the skinny ones as bait.
Excuse me, did you order the caucasian male?
You said we weren't exchanging gifts this year!
I'll eat him after my massage.
Just picking up a little takeout for the family.
Sure, it’s humiliating, but it feels great!
Let's flip him for it.
I'm packing my lunch today.
He thought I was just a helpful dolphin and now I’m afraid to tell him the truth
C'mon, when do we let him know we're not dolphins ?
Tee-hee, he thinks he's still on his surfboard...
I got carryout.
Sometimes they tip, sometimes I eat them.
My wife insisted I bring my own lunch to work...
You wanna hear the punchline or are you going to keep interrupting me?
After the backrub, I'll have my lunch.
He thinks he's standing in shallow water.
Now watch carefully, Andy, next comes the fun part.
Summer people.
I couldn't finish the bottom half, so I'm taking it home for later.
Uber Eats at your service!
It started out as a wart on my dorsal.
In the mood for a slider?
See! Humans ARE dumb enough to use UberShark.
I promised him a ride before lunch.
I'd feel guitly eating someone so stupid.
5 second rule.
It's the pizza guy with dinner.  I had a swimmer for lunch.
I've got humans. You should get yourself checked.
Do you prefer the leg or thigh?
She asked me to grab some carryout tonight.
They are completely unaware while posing for selfies.
I didn’t have the heart to tell him he can’t walk on water.
What was that movie that Grandpa starred in called again?
He isn't organic, but he is free range.
It is a fake! I use it to lure swimmers out where I can eat them.
I'm his emotional support shark. Really.
I'm full. I'm taking this half home for the wife.
Took  you long enough, did you grab the fork and napkins?
Wanna come over to my place?  I have takeout
I'm sorry I ever got friendly with a lifeguard.  I can't get him off my back.
Sometimes I pity their naiveté.
I type feet porn in to google ONE TIME and now I get this everyday.
I would kill him if I didn’t respect him.
Where the hell have you been? My shift's been over for 5 minutes.
Some days being a vegan is harder than others.
I said I’d split it with you...
Crazy, 30 minutes walking on my back and I’m completely relaxed....I may not even eat him
It's part of a new program to change our image.
Think of it as bait.
I can't seem to shake the feeling that I've been taken for a ride.
We're here for the Bar Association annual meeting.  How about you?
They said 'Don't go near shore' . Did I listen - Nooo…
I've got a foot fetish.
You forgot to pack a lunch?
Another lawyer catching a free ride.
Yeah, a stand up comic, but I'll  get  the  last  laugh.
It's supposed to be a decoy that attracts other swimmers.
I hope you don't mind fast food tonight.
You want the leg or the breast?
What hood ornament?"
Just when he thought it was safe to go back in the water.
I know, Mom, "quit playing with my food."
Take a good look. He's about to undergo an Extreme Mako-ver.
I just can't bring myself to eat him. I like the thrill of the hunt.
It's a new ride-share offering by Uber.
How many times have I told you to not play with your dinner?
You want him? I'm still digesting his wife.
I stopped eating meat but I can't seem to get it off my mind.
I always like to bring my own lunch to school.
Allow me to cull this one from the herd.
I'm saving this half for dinner.
Yeah, the ashiatsu massage helps temporarily but I think taking human cartilage supplements is what has truly healed my arthritis.
Yeah, I'm going to eat him, but right now this feels AMAZING on my sciatica.
I think I’ve been attacked by a hammertoe.
I told you I'd find my sea legs!
He thinks he's wading. I hate to disappoint him.
Just saving this for dessert.
Well I'm hungry, too, but this really gets the kinks out of my back.
Free fish or not, if this crowd sings BABY SHARK one more time...
He must be a Republican
I wasn't in the mood to cook tonight ... so I just ordered in.
Was the top half tasty?
It's like Uber Eats only quicker.
Suddenly, he's not half the man he used to be, oh yesterday came suddenly.
He’s holding me down. I’m very bloated.
He calls it "shark surfing," I call it "toppings."
It's not my fault you ate your chiropractor.
Watch this!  I saw a dog do it.  They put a biscuit on his nose and...
She's a lawyer, so it's a professional courtesy on my part.
Once you get past the temptation, it's actually really good for your core.
In a minute he's going to discover there's another definition of  'chum'.
Don't tell me I never bring you gifts.
It's the new rideshare, 'Unter'.
I've tried everything.  I have an appointment with my dermatologest next week to have it removed
He said his big brother was, like, twice as fat.  So, we are going over to where he’s swimming.
I like to start with a false sense of security!
This is what I get for hiring a reputation management consultant.
How was the top half?
No, really, it's the best invertebrate deep tissue massage there is.
No, leave him alone.  He's really helping my back problem.
The fin isn't intimidating anymore
The Dr. said take two of these and call him in the morning.
I’m saving half my snack for later.
It's my emotional support prey.
First a massage, then dinner.
I just can't shake this feeling that I'm missing the obvious.
Do you want to tell him?
It just started out as a barnacle....
So here I am, asking the Sea Witch to give me legs...
I had to give him a minute because he wants a selfie.
I wasn’t hungry so I got it to go
I'm saving it for a mid-afternoon snack.
I just remembered why we never stop swimming.
Peek up there and see if anyone's noticed the top half is missing.
I want to eat him but hes growing on me....
I don't know if I should eat him or enjoy the back massage.
Nothing quite like a foot massage and then dinner.
White men can’t jump.
I’m just going to eat in today. I brought my lunch.
I feel responsible for him now.
I brought you the fresh catch of the day
Ironically, he's a shark spotter.
I know it's dangerous, but I just love the thrill of it all.
He's an attorney and my mentor.
You already had your half.
What? Do I have a booger or something?
Wait'll you see his face when he realizes he's not on a rock.
And we would have been on TV too, if Alabama Public Television didn't take exception to the fact that we're both male.
I'm taking him home for dinner.
He's a human who can stand sharks, so I support him.
Don't look at me like that. He'll be more tender not so worn out.
I feel as though I’ve got a monkey on my back.
He's an old chum of mine.
We actually get along ok; he's a lawyer.
I learned it from a duck hunter I ate.
Make all the fun you want—my chiropractor said it'll help!
Someday, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me.'
I get hypoglycemic.
It's the best kind of hood ornament--edible.
Hop on," I said. "Come join the circle of life.
I just couldn't. It's Bobby Darin.
He wants to compete but can't afford a surfboard
Because he asked politely.
These Internet challenges are getting out of hand!
If you like bones start with his feet.
Sorry I already ate the top half.
I swear, if he calls me Flipper one more time...
Suit yourself, but Shiatsu is the only thing that restores my Qi.
I can't believe you ate yours already. We were supposed to meet for dinner.
Amazon delivery of your Mako-at-Home Meal Kit
It was either him . . .  or a tracking collar!
I 'm saving the other half for later
Doesn’t he hear the music?
I put in a standing order for meat, and this is what happened.
I like the skin nice and crispy.
You asked for take-out.
How did they ever dominate the world when they are not that bright!
Ok, stop messing with me . You seriously don’t see anything at all on my back?  I sure as heck feel something
I have to take these leftovers home for the newborn.
Just watch. This will go viral.
It's symbiotic.  He gets chicks, and I eat them.
I hate this diet...
Call me old fashioned, but I was fine with the pilot fish.
Honey, come on in! It's not that deep!
Uber Eats.....what can I say, it's a living!
I saved the best part for last !
I got the idea from Uber.
The dolphins told me this would be fun.
What happened to yours?
If he gives me less than four stars I'm going to eat him.
It's my new "Meat, Greet, and Eat service."
He promised me a cut when they come watch him walk on water.
We're going to need a bigger ocean.
Yeah, my wife made me take a lunch today.
No, sorry.  I'm saving this half for later.
I saved this part for you.
Want to join me for dinner?
I took my lunch to go.
I always pack a lunch.
He's running for Congress. Testing the waters.
I’m using him as a lure.
I hate these swim with the sharks days.
It's an eatable back scratcher"
No hurry. He’s wading for Godot.”
You can have this half, I’m full
I swear . . . it's not what you think.
He’s not using me, our love is real.
Did you forget lunch?
Have you ever seen that trick where you put a treat on a dog's nose?
I am getting cold feet
You just move like a surfboard until your hungry.
No thanks, I'm full of plastic bags.
It's for a documentary.
He thinks I'm a sandbar.  Make a wish.
Dolphins, yes, but I also blame the breakdown of traditional aquatic values.
As a lawyer, he is one of us.
Law of attraction, my friend.
Can you believe this guy doesn’t clip his toenails before hitting the beach?
I signed up as an uber driver.
Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all: 'I hear you should always eat a balanced diet'; 'It's good to support your food choices; or 'He's a lawyer; professional courtesy'... Let's hope the winning entry is more original!
I'm brown bagging it today.
I got a job as a surfboard.
...and if I balance him on my head for 10 seconds, then toss him up and catch him, I win the bet, right?
I liked it better in the Jaws era when we got some respect.
He's not just a friend, he's my best chum.
It's how big? That's odd because it feels more like two feet to me.
Get your own Lean Cuisine.
I joined Uber's new water program. If I don't get five stars, I eat him.
They pee on us every day and then wonder why we’re so mean.
On the other hand, my back has never felt better.
A lot of trouble for toothpicks.
Freeloader.
I know, I know... I’m going to the dermatologist to get it checked out.
Wait, that’s what chum means?
I like to weigh my food first...you know portion control.
Let him finish his text.
"You want half?"
I regret going vegan.
No, he's the one who needs a bigger boat.
Oh, the quandary this poses. The Internet say,"For every human killed by a shark, humans kill approximately two million sharks."
Normally I would, but it actually feels very good.
You take the left, I'll take the right
Well he was floundering and I don’t care what Spielberg says, I’m no monster
I know we said we weren't going to eat any humans this summer but if he starts to pee I'm gonna lose it...
I decided to pack a lunch today.
It sounds like screaming, but that's just the sound they make when dropped in the water
It's okay. I appreciate not being stereotyped.
Okay, Okay, Okay...I am a humanitarian...Is there a problem?
Why can't I play with my food?
My level of intimidation has dramatically decreased.
stop showing off and just eat him
Trying to convince his friends it’s only 3 feet deep.
We had a much better turnout at last week's 'Yoga with Sharks' class.
I'm part of his walk on water trick.
Is it just me or are we losing some of our fear factor to plastic pollution?
I got some carryout.
It's new bait to fish for humans.
I'm not hungry, but this guy deserves to die.
Is this the future of climate change?
My therapist recommended this mental exercise.
You eat yet?
I'm doing this for Lent.
I got take out.
He doesn't know he's in over his head.
I had just eaten and he asked me nicely.
It's like migraine, a sudden weight on the back of my head.
I hate 'Shark Week'
The top half was pretty good. Saved you the legs and thighs.
I've got a busy day so I brought my lunch.
I saved you the legs.
I ate the top part and I'm saving this for later.
Can you hear his accent?   I think we’re somewhere on Oklahoma.
First, I'll tickle his toes, then ...
That top half was filling. I'm saving these leftovers for tomorrow's breakfast.
Help yourself, I’ve already had my half.
Does it make me look younger?
I'm still waiting for the Jaws music to kick in.
He thinks he's hanging ten, but when I get through with him it'll be more like two.
One trip to SeaWorld and you think you're a dolphin.
He's on top of me, isn't he?
Looks like six more weeks of winter.
Fine, don’t guess.  I’m Carmen Miranda.
It's the eagle holding his upper body upright who I feel sorry for.
This idiot thinks I am his surf board.
I ordered Chinese.
I'm using his GPS.
He's found the sweet spot. I can't reach him.
I find them really useful as bait.
The woman he was with was actually quite tasty.
You’ve got to be kidding. A great white?
So who's the Great White these days?
His phone isn’t waterproof.
The wife was in the mood for tourist."
Why don’t you tell him I’m not a 
sand bar
I packed a lunch today, it's cheaper than eating out.
I'm not hungry and my back feels great.
Look, man, depression has hit me hard. I just don't have the energy anymore to even bite.
I'll tolerate him for a while since he thinks he is swimming with the dolphins.  Then I'll grab a leg.  Want the other?
I just feel like my food choices are weighing me down
Leftovers.
It's just a snack for later. It won't "ruin my dinner," mom.
His arms were delicious but I had to save the rest for later.
I'm playing a long game.
Heads or tails?
Watch this.
I’m waiting until he drops the child
Mate, you've still got a bit of food on you...
It's times like this that really make me regret going vegan.
It’s all part of a balanced diet.
I like foot massages.
I wish he'd jump already.
I've got this guy right where I want him.
Are you sure these are the toppings we ordered?
We have a standing dinner date.
And they wonder why we attack.
The problem with this generation is they didn't grow up watching Jaws.
He ain't heavy, he's my Darwinian brother...
Rideshare app
But he's the only one who's ever made me happy!
I’m taking this one to go.
The kids call it "Sharking."
Yeah, but if I don't deliver it in 30 minutes or less, it's free.
What he doesn't know if, after the massage, I get a happy ending.
what?
I do this for an arm and a leg.
We're bartering. I get a barefoot massage. He gets to swim back to shore.
I want to eat him, but then I'll have to wait 30 minutes until I can go swimming.
He's a chiropractor.  I'll eat him once he's finished adjusting me.
Hey Sal, Do I have food on my head?
Uber doesn't care if you're a shark.
And after the massage, there'll be a full course meal.
Don’t tell him!
I like a massage before my meal.
So I thought Why not take-out tonight ?
Don't attack him, the foot massage feels great.
Join me for lunch?
He keeps singing
"Why not take all of me".
Do you think it’s malignant?
If I can't see him, I won't eat him.
I'll hold off on attacking until after he posts on Instagram.
See? They are not all blood-thirsty monsters.
I don't agree with everything he says, but I do support his platform."
I ordered take out.
I'm giving intermittent fasting a try.
Since  I hired him to be my lookout, I’ve  stopped scaring the swimmers away.
I'm a breast man myself. Do you want a leg?
Oh, him? I just signed up to be a Lyft driver.
He must be an attorney. He seems very comfortable in this environment.
He's giving a speech on how sharks keep oceans clean. Professionally, I'm on the horns of a dilemma.
Say when
Mom always put extra snacks in my back pack
It's a human decoy I made.  Everyone thinks it's safe and pile into the water and then we feast.
I  can't make it any easier for you  , can I  ?
And I thought barnicles were a bummer.
I told him he should just jump the shark already but, he didn't get it.
The guy at the store said you need to keep the head as dry as possible, but I just know I'm going to forget.
Grab one and make a wish.
I can’t break his heart, he thinks I’m a dolphin.
Don't eat my emotional support animal!
There is a $10 delivery fee
Let’s wait til he finishes his cigarette.
We won the surfing contest.
We met on a fetish site.
I enjoy lulling them into a false sense of security.
One lousy surfer and I get 300 hours of community service.
I would, but his arm only got one star on Yelp.
I saved the bottom half for you- I knew it is your favorite.
I know it's tempting, but I'm on this new gluten-free diet.
Do you want him?  He supposedly has bone spurs!!
Yes, I suppose I could use some assertiveness training.
Vinny's experience with a lone shark did not go as planned.
They do takeout.
I think you should know that this guy has a spear gun pointed at you and perhaps you should take a swim back to your own waters .
He's doing something called "selfie?"
It's today's special. Surf & Turf.
I’m a pacifist.
He wants to impress some woman. We all know how that is.
We have to throw it back. It's under the weight allowance.
I bought my own lunch today.
And now, what the hell do I do?
There’s gotta be, like, a million things I could do to this idiot to get on “Shark Week.”
It's bring your lunch to school day.
You're late for dinner.
I've tried everything, but I can't get this monkey off my back.
I can’t remember if I’m supposed to stop swimming, play dead or rap him on the nose.
It was my therapist's idea.
Want the other half?
I'm emotionally attached because years ago when I was really hungry  he gave me a hand.
You have Chip on your shoulder.
What did you do with yours?
Hey, Dad.  He followed me home.  Can I keep him?
I know it's not bacon, but it looks delicious.
Do you ever feel like “the man” is always on your back?
It’s not what it looks like - I’m taking him to lunch.
I don’t know, I guess I’m just not that hungry.
Do I have a pimple on my back?
I say it's a 60% - 40% split since he is standing on me!
I'll consume him in due time. Finish your story.
It's just the old bait and switch.
Give him a break. The guy lost his surfboard.
Going vegan is much more annoying than I thought it would be.
When should I break the news to him that the dolphins are in the other tank?
Luckily for me, Uber's driver background checks are rather lax.
I use him as my look out - the fin thing is just too much of a give-away.
No! You ate the top half!
Should I tell him?
Are you interested in the leftovers?
Here comes the triple flip. I'm going for a vertical entry with this one.
I just let him think we have a ‘special  bond’ then I’ll eat him.
Did you enjoy the top half?
Its a symbiotic relationship, he gets to swim without getting tired and I get to eat him when he's done.
Should I break it to him?
It's customary to tip for your grubhub delivery
It was either this or the chiropractor.
it's only my second week, but I'm already finding it really hard to be vegan
I'm starting a balanced diet today.
We're gonna need a bigger ocean.
The salesman said it would be less conspicuous than a fin.
I stopped by the shore on my way home.  Thought you might like this.
Technically, we would remain vegan because he was.
It's working, Ralph. He's telling everyone to come out and stand on this sandbar !
My ad was supposed to say ‘Wanted: Sucker Fish’, but in print it got cut off...
Not a fan of legs and thighs, you?
Where have you been? Dinner's ready.
No, honey, it's not an affair, just a great little massage.
They're much more comfortable approaching since I got the doll.
Open real wide now. When I go low, you go high!
Hey, wanna play wishbone?
My psychiatrist recommended exposure therapy to combat my compulsive overeating.
I know, honey, I know. But, we have just got to watch the carbs.
Just wait until he finds out I'm not a dolphin.
Professional courtesy. We might need a good lawyer some day.
Yeah, I just don't have the heart, OK? His glasses fell off, then he started swimming in my direction yelling here Flipper, here boy!
I know you hate talking about dinner plans when we’ve just had lunch...
A little nip on the ankle should get him off my back.
He thinks he's my surf buddy, but he's just chum.
You know you can just eat him, right?
He's making a sequel to "Jaws" and I am auditioning for the lead.
Hey, you promised dessert if I brought the entree.
Get it off, get it off, get it off!
I’m waiting for him to get off his phone.
Please go up and see if he's as bony as he feels.  I'm on a low-fat diet.
Works such a drag, I just can’t get this guy off my back!
I'm waiting for a seal, they have more meat on them !!
His feet stink like the Bronx so maybe he tastes good, too.
What?! You have a problem with carry-out?
I'm carrying 125 pounds in the finals of the handicapped shark races. How about you?
What do you say we see how he hangs five?
Of course we’ll eat him, but let him adjust my spine first
These millennials think they're entitled to everything.
I’m on Step 9, Making Amends.
Poor guy thinks he’s walking on water... at least he’ll go out in style.
You should start packing a lunch too.
I can't shake him.  How did you get rid of yours?
I lost a bet to a vulture. He gets to go first.
I packed a lunch.
An hour a week and the back’s good as new.
I was always told that we were on top of the food 
chain.
It's either this or pain pills.
Yeah, it's great, I make my own hours and eat on the job!
I've really lost the urge since I  can't hear the theme music.
Professional respect...he's a lawyer.
I disagree. I think this ride shark service could habe some legs to it.
I’m sorry man, but I can’t do it without the music
I'm just keeping him fresh for dinner when I get hungry.
He thinks I'm sandbar, and now I don't have the heart.
He complained about the rate so I told him I'd take half off.
No, ma!  I won't stop playing with my food!
matter of fact, no, i’m a man-standing shark.
Bait. The fin was a dead giveaway.
Uber Eats delivery.
It's my first time as an Uber driver, but if I get humgry it's all over.
More effective than hot rocks and tastes better too.
Uber shark food delivery ... here's your order.
I brought you leftovers...
Snacks on me!
This intermittent fasting is getting harder and harder.
It's an Uber experimental ride-share-eat option.
He thinks all sharks are bottom feeders.
Hi, I have an Uber Eats order for Bruce
I hate the gig economy.
As above, so below.
It's symbiotic for now. I'm not making any promises.
He's heavy, but he's a great decoy.
I think can we can take the mixed doubles water ballet title, if I can control my appetite.
I always bring a snack.
Shorts week
I ate the last two, so the resort put me on probation.
Think cognitive dissonance.
It’s a symbiotic relationship
Drumstick?
You should see him from the waist up.
I know he's heavy, but you should see my abs.
Why don't they ever talk about our good qualities?
He’s gonna be surprised when he finds out I’m not Shamu.
Trust me, it’s a great way to lure the others.
I'd take his legs off, but he's scratching a spot I can't reach.
Fast food to go!
Can you finish the rest?  I just wanted the wings and breast.
Call PR...aren’t they supposed to be scared of us!
I'm on a balanced diet.
I like to mess with them a little before I take a bite.
Here's your Uber Eats Delivery"
Last client of the day.
You can start with the drumsticks
Out of the Way! He is one of us,  Binsky just passed the Bar.
"Your delivery of a gluten-free person for dinner."
The family meal always ends up being too much food.
It's take-out tonight.  End of discussion.
Word is, Sharkworld may raise our pay to $15 per hour, plus chum.
I might be hungry later.
I've lost my edge!
Sorry, I can't go out to lunch today.  I brought leftovers.
He loves the ocean, but he can't swim.
I don't know if I should eat him or rescind his pro-surfer's certificate.
I'm evolving.
I'm making extra money as a uber driver.
I 'm taking a course in Anger Management"
Bad hair day
If anything, it's a conflict of interest.
I met him in my “Vegan for Dummies” cooking class.
I thought you said to pack a lunch?
I got us takeout.
Have you met Finn?
Let’s see if he can swim with one leg.”
I'm not hungry. Are you?
I call it my "Scenic Dinner Cruise". I'm the cruise part.
I'm trying a new approach, because those suck-up dolphins aren't getting killed for their fins.
Some situations really test my decision to go vegan.
I swim carefully, but they rarely give me five stars.
Tell me the truth: have I gained weight?
The Twelve Apostles still think He can walk on water...
I wish he'd stuck with goat yoga.
He's my attorney
I just don't have the heart to tell him he's in too deep.
I still don't get why my folks told me not to play with my food.
Something like this happens every time I try to quit.
I just know I’m going to get Athlete’s Fin from this.”
On the count of 3...
He's my brother-in-law. I tried to talk her out of it, but she said I was exhibiting a species bias.
I thought I’d try an edible back massager
He is going to have a sinking feeling soon...
He's all yours... I am a "breast guy" !
Leftovers. Why do you ask?
I'm not hungry, but I don't think I can pass up the teachable moment.
It's only humiliating if you don't eat him afterwards.
He said he needs to finish tweeting first.
I'd say it's a fair exchange--he scratches my back and I don't eat him.
As a support shark I get into the movies for free.
Shall I tell him, or should you?
My generation always swam against the current in freezing water to hunt for food. Your soft generation lays around in globally-warmed water waiting for delivery.
I'm about to give him a fish pedicure he won't ever forget.
I told you we look like surfboards
Climate change.
I brought the hors d'oeuvre.
He said he was a lawyer, so I knew he was one of us.
Just in case I get hungry later.
Man, that damn 'Shark Tale" movie really killed our street cred.
I don’t know how much longer I can take working under this guy!
I found him on decoys.com
''I owe him 'cause I ate his surfboard.''
If he shouts 'Hey, Bro!--Who's the Man!' one more time, let's snap him in half!
When do you think I should tell him?
This one's O.K. The last guy was wearing cleats.
I can’t stand this anymore, and they wonder why we bite them from time to time !
My PR team thought it would help soften my image.
I’m working on a balanced diet.
We make a wish, and then we each grab an end…
Goat yoga is so passé
Actually, I think I prefer Rolfing.
Talk about a false sense of security!
He works on my back and I don't eat him.
I've become a bottom feeder.
There is no other half.
Bite me in the snout next time I say work well with people.
He says he's honoring me by 'standing on the shoulders of greatness.'
Talk about white privilege.
Yes, he's adopted. How did you know?
White privilege, need I say more?
I'll take this half to go
This intermittent fasting is killing me.
Yes I’m giving him a ride. You’ve never heard of SCUBER?
I told you meeting Aquaman would be a disappointment.
Ashiatsu. Works out my aggressions.
My therapist says I need to be less reactive.
He Is Heavy, He Ain’t My Brother.
He’s right on top of me, isn’t he?
No, I know he's there, but sometimes I just want to have to work for it.
Jump the shark?
You’re holding up dinner.
I can't.  We've bonded.
I know it’s a cliché, but yes, he’s a lawyer.
I hope he will attract a plumper one.
When did you get that 4th gill?
It really helps my back!
They call it shark pilates.
Yeah, I prefer wings.
He made a bet that he could walk on water. I get a cut if he wins.
I hate being vegan....
You wanted the lower torso, right?
He's on Retainer.
It's a temporary symbiotic relationship; he likes to surf, I like to eat.
Not happy about this gig economy I find myself in.
I could be here a while. He’s reading the Mueller Report.
I'm thinking of writing a country music song about it.
I know this area is for members only--I'm about to take care of that.
Legs or thighs?
He's soooo worth it when I get an itchy fin.
I love to watch their face when they slip
I have to swim constantly anyway, so really the new gig economy is working for me.
He’s telling everyone that he’s a standup comic. Is there such a thing?
It's good for my core.
It's rebranding - folks were starting to have a negative association with the fin.
I just picked up dinner.
The vet said I have to start lifting weights.
Yeah, I'm doing a gig now for Uber Eats.
It's symbiotic. He eases my back pain, and I don't eat him.
And his feet are all slimy and gross, too!
I just hate those skinny bones stuck in my throat.
Some fins wrong. 
I'm just not sure what.
Do you want to join me for dinner?
I'm sick of shark week.
I used to think "When your a shark you're a shark all the way", but now I dunno
Who takes "Jumping the shark" literally?
It was a typo-the email said “shark attach”.
In the good old days, it was an albatross around the neck.
Lyft was hiring. I needed money. Don't mess this up for me.
Nah, it would be like shooting fish in a barrel.
He does not take advantage of me! It's a symbiotic relationship.
It's a new ride share program called SCUBER.
I just love this place.  Every massage comes with a free meal.
Haven't you ever heard of a symbiotic ashiatsu relationship?
So I guess now I'm a HammerToe Shark?
If this doesn’t get us on the caption contest, I don’t know what will.
Compliments of the Chef
But I can't do it.  He's so clueless and trusting.
We need a Jaws reboot to teach this generation some respect.
This will keep it fresh until we get home and eat.
I feel like I forgot something...
Are you hungry for schmuck?
I'm no marine biologist but this doesn't feel like a sucker fish.
He says that if I support him it will improve our reputation.
That's when I get this sense of things being unreal and I feel detached from myself and I just don't know what to do.
Weight-bearing exercise is super important as you get older.
Camouflage.
He tells everyone he's the "great white one".
When should we tell him that he's not on a sandbar?
Stop judging my taste in symbiotic relationships!
Humans, always looking out for danger when it's right under their feet.
You got some food on your face.
I know, but he's nice and I'm so done with being dangerous.
Global warming is bringing them out earlier in the season.
God is great.  God is good.  Let us thank him for this food.
So, I get this sonar call, I show up at some spot, someone climbs aboard and off we go.
These days you just look at an endangered species and The Man will be ridin’ your back for years”
And I  had to pick this week to go vegan!
Do you ever feel like the man is holding you down?
I know, I know; but he said 
he could get me on ‘Shark Tank’!
To combat our bad reputation, I thought I'd try the eco-tourism angle.
Since I started seeing him three times a week, my neck is 100% better.
I don't have the heart to tell the guy that he's no longer standing on a sandbar.
Okay, yes I'm using a decoy. Some of us are not as fast as we used to be.
No kidding? I've never tried shiatsu.
Too skinny. I’m gonna throw this one back.
Yeah Jack. All they see from shore is a guy bobbing around having fun. It's my sure-fire meal ticket!
Here you go. Thanks for calling GrubHub.
He’s my emotional support pet, or if that doesn’t help, a midday snack.
Hungry? I just ate his other half.
I'm saving it for a snack attack.
On 3. 1...2...
Its something called ride sharing.
The surfboard was very filling.
Time to let him know I'm not a dolphin.
How long have you been an Uber Shark?
I don’t get it.  This massage thing is just not what it’s cracked up to be.
Eat this guy, will ya.  I can't shake him.
The worst part is his feet smell.
Don’t judge me. I think we can make this relationship work.
Dude gives me a back massage and I don’t eat him, fair deal?
Sometimes you  get  exactly what  you  wish  for.
I didn't believe in chiropractors either.
I'm saving this half for brunch.
Works great for my sciatica.
Dinner is served Madam.
I picked up dinner on the way home.
He keeps calling me Flipper. I'm playing along until lunchtime.
One leg, his Instagram goes viral, and I'm the bad guy.
I ate his surfboard. Now what?
He wants me to swim near the surface so he can impress some chick Mary Magdalene...
This is why I don't come to New York anymore, it's just not a challenge here.
Every time I go on a diet, temptation comes a clompin'."
I picked up lunch for you
He thinks he is standing on the bottom.  Watch this!
The ones trying to swim with us are a little more satisfying. 
Less fat, more filling.
I brought home takeout.
Back off -- where are we gonna find another chiropractor?
It's just easier than carrying a lunch sack.
I don’t have the heart to tell him.
I’ve taken a job with Lyft!
It’s from that new take-out place down the beach. I’ll let you know later if it lives up to the buzz.
I have to digest his surfboard before I eat him.
port-a-snack
He thinks he's standing on the bottom.  We can dine when the others arrive.
I tried being nice to him for once, and now he won't leave me alone.
Please don't eat him. My back has never felt so good.
AND TODAY'S SPECIAL APPETIZER,,HOMME.
I knew I it was a mistake to go Vegan.
After he  gives me shiatsu, I'm giving him a pedicure.
I have to replace the board I damaged
I’d dump him, but turns out he does wonders for my sciatica.
They’re endangered
I'm not holding him up, he thinks he's holding me down.
Ok fine, as long as it won’t spoil your dinner.
You wanna take him for a while. I gotta keep movin’.
He's the best ashiatsu massage therapist outside of Cancun.
This guy just won't get off my back - can you give him a scare?
I thought you said it was a potluck.
I didn’t have a choice - I ate his surfboard!
I'm his Uber diver.
He's a cousin of ours - a loan shark.
I think they’re taking this “apex predator” thing a little too far.
If I move, do you think he’ll yell SHARK?
Shark surfing is trending.  You free for dinner?
Isn't this what you wanted for dinner?
When you said "meet me at noon" I didn't realize it was for lunch.
I like to play with my food before eating it.
I’m stuffed. Would you like the other half?
Will you get this guy off my back please?
I carry my lunch.
I told him that if he doesn’t get off my back, I’m going to eat him.  But I didn’t tell him that I’m going to him anyway.
You can have the first bite.
I'm just giving him a lift before I have a bite to eat.
He’s afraid of water over his head.  Sharks, not so much.
Should I let him finish his hot dog first?
I'm bringing the food. Did you get the drinks?
Well, Darren, maybe this is my happy place.
I know I look funny but you wouldn't believe the reception.
Go ahead, I had a late lunch.
On the count of three, let’s grab lunch.
One more lawyer joke and he’s toast.
Do you have a problem with professional courtesy?  He’s a lawyer.
It's BYOB, right?
Why does stupid taste so good?
Wow, the odds of being stepped on by a human is a million to one, we should play powerball this week.
Yeah, you just sign up through the ridesharing app.
He's free-range, humanely raised, and non-GMO.
Look...I did not go vegan because it was going to be easy, Walter!
I know you told me not to give it a name...
Dinner, ma'am , freshly served.
If he calls me Flipper one more time...
The lack of respect for the environment is getting out of control
Do you want to break it to him...or should I?
I eat anyone who gives me less than four stars.
The worst part is that he keeps repeating that ridiculous song.
He's gonna have to get a bigger shark.
It's symbiotic, he's promised not to turn my fins into soup.
I suppose he thinks I'm a dolphin.
Lawyers are taking this professional-courtesy thing to a whole other level."
It’s called shark boarding but it isn’t catching on.
Some of these guys, it's like they don't even want to be eaten!
Don’t knock it. I’m getting 60 bucks an hour as a powered surfboard.
I think he’s got a career in stand-up.
And you get a snack after the back rub.
It's a long story.
He’s a Shark Fin Soup protestor!
Please tell me it's lunchtime.
I had to go and attack a damn lawyer!
I stopped biting people after my cardiologist suggested a plant-based diet.
Predatory lending? I’m only charging 10% interest to keep this guy afloat.
If you don’t tell him, I won’t tell him.
When did this become a "thing"?
He’s already booked me for Shark Week. And, he thinks I could be the next Jaws! So no you may not eat him.
I lost his law suit, I gotta live with the shame.
Don't knock it. It's the best fishing lure I've ever used
I Think I'm A Vegan.
I think it's some kind of remora.  See if you can scrape it off me.
It's my new diet.  You have to balance your food.
I'm picking up  a few extra bucks working for Uber.
His chiropractic technique is simply delicious!
He said his name is Fonzie and he's just doing it for the ratings.
Says he's a shark spotter
The legs are enticing, but the massage is incredible.
They get a tad mealy if you just let 'em drown.
I promised once more around before we eat him.
I know I said I'd be home an hour ago, but look -- I brought you my leftovers!
You’ve never had a foot massage?  Oh, man, try it!
I ate his paddle board by mistake and now I feel sorry for him.
This all started with those @#&* dolphins.
It just pee`d on me. 
What do I do?
WHAT DO I DO?!
This joker thinks he’s standing on a sandbar!  Ya hungry?
Hungry for some surf 'n' turf?
He thinks I'm a sandbar and it would be awkward to move now.
Did you order Grubhub?
I know, but they're even more delicious if they bake in the sun for a few minutes until they're well done.
Don't judge me, bro... everyone's side gig is Uber
“He sure as hell stuck the landing!”
I just like the way it feels, okay ?
That's the deal: I let him take a selfie surfing a shark, and he lets me eat him with no fuss
These millennial snorkelers are awfully entitled.
Packing my own lunch is a chore, but nothing beats eating locals.
I hate it when the old Sea World training kicks in.
You've got to believe me,it's completely platonic.
'cuz you are what you eat
I think it helps our image.
It’s an Uber pilot program.
Tell them you're a vegetarian and they think they can walk all over you.
Simple. We bet, He won.
I ordered it to go.
Just toying with him before my dinner
He thinks I am an Uber
This is my friend Larry. He’s not much of a swimmer.”
Are you sick of white meat?
I told you that it was all over when they started with that swimming with the dolphins thing.
Say what you will about chiropractors...
My shrink is calling it "exposure therapy".
Give these humans an inch and they walk all over you.
We're both vegan.
He thinks he's safe on a rock; I'm saving him for our family frenzy at suppertime.
Yeah, it's kinda like uber.
So then he looks at his cellphone and says, "You must be my Uber Fish."
Got drunk, lost a bet, its hell...
He calls himself the "Shark Whisperer".  I'm going to wait until there's a huge crowd and then I'll rip him to shreds.
I know ... But I like ... how he rubs my neck ...
Okay, flip him. Heads he’s mine, tails he’s yours
Yes, Modell, I am going to eat it. If you want a piece, just ask!
Did you order the thighs?
It started out as a rash.
I’m working on my instant gratification issues
I’m starting to rethink my “friends not food” mantra.
I know, but he satisfies an itch.
Well, I say just because I'm a sand shark doesn't mean you can walk all over me!
His feet feel really nice on my back, but I also want to eat him.
My chiropractor says this helps.
Get ready.  These decoys really draw them in.
I find it much more convenient to pack a lunch.
He doesn't believe me when I say, 'Get off my back.'
It's supposed to be like goat yoga.
Ah, ha, ha, I fooled you!   This is the bottom half of the guy I bit in two off Florida!
A balanced diet is always best!
Lenny, you do realize they can see through the tank... right?
Finders, keepers!
Wanna a Bite?
It’s too easy!
Yep, another hitchhiker. He thinks I'm taking him to Hawaii. Dinner at 7?"

Sunil Mahtani, Westport, CT
sm@kingfisherinvestors.co
Yeah, I'm hungry... but where's the sport in it?
He’s made no eye contact whatsoever and has been on the phone since he stepped off shore!
No thanks I have my own lunch.
He knows it's dangerous, but sometimes the only way to keep your head above water is a loan shark.
Will you judge me if I drop him?
I’m lulling him into a false sense of security.
Yes, Steve, I do know this looks bad, and no, I do not have a plan to resolve this amicably.
I call it lifeguard bating.
It's all I can get after that Katy Perry gig.
Swimming with the sharks, he calls it. To think I left a good job at Sea World for this.
It's Hemingway's great grandson.
I hate it when lawyers go on vacation and think they’re one of us.
Yes, I am saving it for later.
So how do you like my new periscope?
You've heard of the marshmallow test?  If I wait, a second one will come along and I can eat both of them.
My headache's gone.
Wanna see me flip him into my mouth whole? The look of fear and surprise is delightful.
It feels so good when he wiggles his toes.
No, really! The guy in the white coat said  if I hold off for 15 minutes, I can have two.
But I did get the better half!
I'm rethinking this Uber gig.
I found him first.
“I know it’s a mannequin. I’m fishing for lifeguards.”
For being a Shepard of the sea, Aquaman is kinda an ass
I might as well come out and admit it. I feel that I 'm a dolphin.
I'm off probation after my community service hours are completed.
And the bottom half makes a one-of-a-kind hat.
Your order is here.
Apparently this is an example of what is known as "Florida Man".
If I don't carry a snack for the kids I can't even get them out of the bay
It is proprietary. I think this idea has legs.
Morty, be honest.... does this pair of human legs make me look fat?
Don’t ask. It’s Brexit.
Standing room only.
Marco?
You're about to witness, "The Ultimate Wedgie!"
When do we let him know he's not standing on a rock?
He's not heavy. He's my brother up the food chain.
I'd eat him except he has our cell phone.
I have a family to feed.
I had the top half for lunch, the bottom half I'm saving for supper.
Not only that, he's spinning a hula hoop.
Cirque de Soleil. Avoid 'em--it's like chewing on a broomstick.
Our deal is that he scratches my back, and I don't scratch his.
I was told it was potluck.
It's a perfect meal. Surf & Turf.
Be honest, is the hat too much?
Just play along. Dinner is later.
You know the one about the scorpion and the frog?
Snack time!  Ready?  on 1...2...3!
Please don’t eat my therapy human this time, Steve.
It's called "delayed gratification".
It was either this or goat yoga.
I decided to go with Lyft.
I had a big breakfast, but I'll be hungry again in an hour.
Looks like someone is getting excited for People Week...
No, Frank, you can't "borrow" my emotional support animal.
If I hear "nice hat!" one more time...
I think of it as the massage lunch package.
I owe him. I ate his ex-wife.
I ordered Uber eats and got Uber lift instead.
Airbnb. The wife's idea.
If he thinks he’s on a surfboard, he’s in for a big surprise!!
We're a duo - I've got the fins, he's got the shins...
for now.
Because they taste better when they're really fresh.
What about you? Ever wanted to try paddle boarding?
Working for Uber Eats has really helped pay down my student loan debt.
I'm not distracted, I've just got a lot on my mind.
I’m codependent...
Welcome to Sea World.
One day we’re going to look back at this and laugh.
I feel sorry for him, he can't swim!
I don't enjoy this whole 'let's change our image' thing.
Please don't eat my massage therapist!
What odd growth? I don’t feel anything.
I figured I'd give him a false sense of security.
Tell me I’m not hallucinating.
These young kids have never even heard of Jaws.
Go ahead. Dare him to hang ten.
Here's your dinner dear.
 You did say you wanted white meat meat, right?
It's part of my community service for that incident last summer.
Welcome to Sea World. It will all make sense after a while.
Do you prefer him over easy or sunny-side up?
I’m more of a leg and butt shark.
It's the lack of respect that bothers me most.
I'm not very hungry.
Please tell me you like white meat.
He's mine... I'm taking him for a ride.
Don’t go near the beach!
he's telling them all to come on in, I'm serving in 5 minutes.
It’s leftovers, I ate the other half last night.
You always say  “save the leftovers “, but you never eat ‘em...
Looks like they're making another Happy Days spin-off
When I'm through playing, would you like breast or thigh?
Why not?  He gives a great back massage.
How do I get this monkey off my back?
I know what it looks like, but it’s been great for my back pain!
I’ve turned the page, Jeff, and now think of them as family.
My Chiropractor said it's good for the Cartilage
It's my community service and its killing me.
Get ready.  I heard him call out "C'mon everybody.  The water feels great!"
Next time you troll the bait.
You call Uber eats?
Animal, vegetable, or optometrist?
I hear it’s good for your core.
He thinks I'm a rock.  I'm just holding him here until I get hungry.
I did the damn music!
Yup. I know... "shark boarding". What's next?
I mistakenly ate his board. A ride is the least I can do...
It's called  Ashiatsu and don't you dare ruin this for me !
No, I'm on this 30 day cleanse now.
I had a big breakfast.
We made a deal.....I get a back rub, and he gets to live.
Professional courtesy. He’s a member of the bar.
Of course he's an attorney.
Manna from heaven.
The dolphin said this was the best way to get more subscribers on YouTube.
Can we get fined for chumming?
I'm stuffed. You want leftovers?
Your delivery of a gluten free dinner
... because he thinks I'm a dolphin. You hungry?
Who’s gonna tell him?
Another consequence of global warming:  a dorsal Finn.
They’re treading a fin line.
I told you not to eat that surfboard
I'm gonna count to three...
This new workplace tolerance training is so humiliating.
Yeah, well, YOU try turning down a contract with the X-Games.
I wasn't really hungry when I found him, so I figure I'll save him for later.
First I must gain his trust.
The gig economy has its ups and downs.
Hold still. The wife is meatier.
No, it's not like shooting fish in a barrel.
Free delivery!
I'm saving him for dinner.
What? Do I have food on my face?
I am bringing supper over to the new shark family that just moved in across the bay
I'm tired of going around with a Chip on my shoulder.
I know it’s cliché, Gary, but I think it gives me an edge with the girls.
I'm saving this half for lunch tomorrow.
He thinks he's on a sandbar. Watch me introduce some sharp shells.
I have an appointment with the doctor this week to get it removed.
Some guy named Steven Spielberg.
I ate this guy's surfboard, now I have to do this for 2 weeks.
I don't care which cultures still eat our fins, I'm not gonna racially profile this guy!
He insists; just because I ate his surfboard by mistake.
They call it shark surfing.  I call it playing with my food.
No one told me becoming vegan would lead to this!
It’s the takeout half off meal deal.
I think the remoras are evolving.
I signed on with Uber.
Play it cool. It's for his PETA campaign against Shark fin soup.
This guy better give me five stars.
I thought it was a really big remora.
Catch up, dude. The fin thing is a dead give away.
He a fantastic and loving husband, but the constant surfacing for him to breath is getting old.
I thought I'd help him find his surfboard before I eat him
He wanted to say goodbye to his family.
I was full; I'm planning to finish it later on.
He failed to jump the shark.
white people
Do me a favor and eat this guy off my back
Yeah, well, you should see his other half. Course, you can't.
I know; I'm an embarrassment to my species"
Do me a favor and bite his leg.
Hey, honey. Want to split a dessert?
It's either this or extinction.
Oh
I thought it was a potluck!
I know this looks bad, but I'm just not hungry, okay?
So... What do you think?  Should we get him now or save him for later?
It's the latest thing in evolution - my own decoy!
I'm so full. Do you want the bottom half?
I was going to eat him but my back is really feeling the benefit.
I'm only eating locally sourced. This guy was flown in from DesMoines."
Until Shark Week starts filming again, I have to make ends meet by providing ride-sharing for swimmers.
If I stop swimming his shorts fall down.
I told you my friend was a "stand-up" kind of guy
Hi sweetie. Just wanted to show you that I am not a bottom feeder.
You know what’s been on my mind lately?
I like to save the bottom half for dessert.
I've got the entree"
"The dolphin mask worked like a charm."
I was told to bring lunch.
This guy walks on my back every Wednesday. Does wonders for my sciatica.
I hope you didn't cook, I brought take-out."

David and Miriam, Pacifica, C
I just can't shake this funny feeling.
He thinks he’s swimming with dolphins.
I support him for the tax breaks.
Better than any pilot fish.  He's a professional pilot.
No, I haven't seen Jaws. Why do you ask?
So what are YOU bringing to Terry's pot-luck dinner?
You ordered, lunch?
Hey honey, there was too much to eat at the party so I brought you some leftovers.
It’s less conspicuous than when my dorsal fin sticks out of the water.
If you think this looks bad, stick your head up and get a look at the other half
He's too skinny.  I'm taking him back to shore."
Michael Rogness, St. Paul, MN
Call it! Heads or tails?
Grab the other leg and let's make a wish.
I finally got the monkey off my back, now this!
You ordered the ‘Businessman Express’ lunch, Sir?
I’d eat this guy, but I’m still full from  those plastic bags.
It's the least I could offer after eating his surfboard.
I could only eat half of it. Just wasn’t that hungry.
I got a summer job as a surfboard.
I keep telling him I'm a fish not a mammal.
He’s starting to piss me off.
It’s the same guy who was struck by lightning last week.
It’s the latest millennial thing - shark yoga.
Thanks,but I brought my lunch today.
Great Meal Aboard"
It's one of those no frills around the world cruise
His Uber rating is a 4.7
Do I look like a surfboard?
I brought you dinner.
You'll have to talk to the man upstairs.
They`re featuring me in a nature film - "When Fish Had Feet".
He doesn’t understand what jumping the shark really means!
He's got my back, Dude.  Move on!
They think he's standing on a sandbar.
It's not my dream job, but he pays me scale.
I lost a bet.
This is our version of meals on wheels
He’s my spotter.
Weird. I heard him say “Hold my beer—watch this.”
It's like Lyft and Uber Eats all in one.
Sea World has the nerve to call this "a promotion"?
The top half tasted great, I’m just way too full to finish up.
Yeah, I can't believe it either.
Nah, too easy.
I bet if you say, 'Hey look! A phone!" he'll jump down right away
Well, it WAS a shared ride.
He took me for a ride!
I enjoy them dry on top and wet on the bottom.
I guess he thinks I'm a skate.
Doctor says it will help me quit
It's still better than wearing Crocs.
You want to split an appetizer?
The back massage comes with a lunch option.
The money is not great, but it's a job.
Can I get back with you? I'm going to lunch.
Heads he's mine. Tails he's yours.
You can Venmo me for your half.
I can't bite him.  I'm an Uber driver.
With that global warming I feel like eating salad only.
My nutritionist told me I needed to balance my diet
His toenails are a little sharp.
This one is yours, the last one gave me heartburn.
I ate half, and I'm saving the rest for a snack later.
He ain't heavy he's my dinner.
I was saving him for later, but I'm hungry now.  Want a bite?
Would you care to share my appetizer"?
Normally I'd be asking myself the same question, but his specialty is sshiatsu and my dorsal fin's been killing me.
You had to choose NOW to suggest that we become Pescatarians?!
Dibs on the crunchy part.
There's this great new takeout place down the coast.
I’ve had it up my neck with bloody tourists!
Would you like fries with that?
Is being vegan written all over my fins?
Bringing lunch from home for a change.
Did you order takeout?
I am beginning to rethink this Uber gig.
Goat yoga is for sissies.
I hope you don't mind, we're having take-out tonight.
He likes a cigarette after we have sex.
Take out is always best the day after.
He wanted to impress his girlfriend but enough is enough!
i try to remind myself: a caldera, the singularity, climate change, antibiotic resistance—something's gonna clip these dumbfucks.
You want this half?
It’s your Uber Eats fresh food delivery!”
Make a wish.
'I thought you said he was supposed to jump'.
I only eat them if they don’t tip.
I've decided to go back on the Paleo diet.
There's nothing better than an ashiatsu massage before dinner.
Wild, fresh caught!  Help yourself!
That disguise is not going to fool any of the swimmers, Sal.
Feels like remora, tastes like chicken.
My other option was cataract surgery.
Bet you a fin I can flip him and catch him before you do a full circle.
They're paying me more than scale for Shark Week...
He asked for a ride once, and now it's, like, every day!
For once I'd like to see how the other half lives.
I told the sucker I work for Uber. Now hurry home and tell the kids dinner's almost here.
He' ll teach me to walk I'll teach him to swim.
Wait till he finds out where he really is.
I'm a total magnet for humans.
I call it Farm-to-table.
Don’t laugh if I don’t eat this guy for fifteen minutes I get a second one!
And we just ate.
I'll flip him and then we split  him.
It was 'all-you-could-eat' night at that little bistro by the sand bar.
I guess I can say good-bye to flaunting my dorsal fin.
You do it your way, I'll do it mine.
Saved you the lower half
This is as close as he gets to be God and walking on water.
Yeah, well, you should've seen the one that got away.
I heard you are a leg man.
Did you know an estimated 100 million sharks are wantonly killed every year around the world? I think it is time we doing something about that, starting right here.
If you order a decoy, spend the extra money for the model that waves its arms and screams Help!
i'm saving half for dessert
Play with your own food.
8.25 isn't enough to have the customers just walk all over you.
Dang, I lost mine!
May I recommend a nice cabernet sauvignon to go with the gentleman’s entree?
You ordered the veggie lover, hold the sun screen.
Yeah, I know I should eat him, but he promised  me a part in the upcoming "Sharknado" sequel.
Lunch is weighing me down again.
Hey Franck, by any chance, have you seen my lunch?
Watch this back flip! then we'll eat.
We have a kinship. His legs are great and white.
Going vegan has been harder than expected.
You're invading my territory again! This time I brought my lawyer.
So, after I swallowed his surfboard...
The wife didn’t feel like eating out so I picked up some fast food
Look! I found a wishbone.
I ate his surfboard.
I just got some takeout
Does this make me look fat?
Brining 101
What, you don’t play with your food?!
I’m going to miss him after I eat him.
What? I'm celebrating Human Week.
It's a potluck
It's court-ordered restitution for eating his surfboard
Pity. He was only a couple feet short of the dolphin tank.
SUP, man?
See if this is all that's left.
Can you help me; I'm trying to get this monkey off my back.
First he called me Shamu, then...
I figure with the current state of politics they’ve got enough going on.
I'll stay here while you grab dinner for us both.
I'm afraid if I eat him it'll affect my star rating.
Fast talking salesman... you go in for a massage, and come back with an edible periscope.
The fin.  He thinks I'm a rescue porpoise.  Just wait ONE minute!
He’s marinating.
I can't get him of my back.
I'm waiting for him to stop peeing.
It's a new reality show that's a mash up of Shark Tank and Survivor.
Keep your jaws off him. I'm saving him for dessert.
I'm just not in the mood for stalking and attacking tonight, dear, so I decided on carry-out.
He's auditioning for America's Got Talent.
I can’t decide; shiatsu or lunch?
Want to share lunch?
They just don't fear us anymore ever since those "Sharknado" movies came out.
They've really become too comfortable after that Nemo movie.
I've got to get my Uber driver rating back above 4 stars after last month's "incident".
Then pollution gets worse and worse each year.
Not my fault. Said he was a chiropractor.
Saving him for the barbecue on the 4th
Can you get him off my back?
First the massage, then the meal
I thought I might as well bring lunch.
It's Barnacle Bill again.
Stop playing with your food Larry.
Discovery Channel needs to up our pay. These Shark Week bits are getting ridiculous.
Would you like the other half?
He told me he'd keep an eye out for Robert Shaw.
He’s my only link to the outside world..
Sharks are the scooters of the sea,” he said
I could use a good toothpick in about 30 seconds.
My therapist says I need to submit more.
you can't just let him walk all over you!
Jaw, paper, fin?"
I already ate the top half, so sure you can have the rest...
He's outta his depth.
I offered to give him some tips. He's a loan shark.
I don't know; something about jumping the shark."
Should I tell him that he's out of his depth?
Well, I couldn't make anything by biting people, so I started being an Uber driver.
Emotional support pet for now,snack if it doesn't work out.
I’m trying a more balanced approach to eating.
Ya. It’s my lawyer! Professional  courtesy...gets me real close to the beach!
Oh boy Surfer Surprise for dinner tonight!
No, he’s not a lawyer. He’s my agent.
He's in training to jump the shark.
The flavor is improved if they feel well supported
ONE LAST TIME- I go low you go high
Humans are a pain in the neck
Lawyer, professional courtesy.
So when I roll, grab his leg...
It's called aquatic reflexology"
You picked the wrong day to go vegetarian.
This dumb surfer dude thinks I'm a dolphin.  I'm just taking him far enough out to sea that no one will hear his screams.
Being a vegan is easy.  Here, try a little I Can't Believe It's Not Human.
Its like Uber, but with stronger incentives for good tips
From the surface we look like surf boards.
Sorry honey, but it sure beats your fin massages.
He's for my hard-to-scratch spots.
I actually never been this close to one before.
What  kind of wine goes with shlump?
Dinner is served.
Why don’t you try swimming with people
Well, he's a lawyer. And a very good one at that.
I’ve switched to live bait.
That’ll be $22.50 plus tip.
My wife sent me out for food for our daughter's graduation party.
Unlike you, I can live with it, Roger.
I owe the local loan shark a favor.
I had to pick up a side gig for Uber.
I keep telling you,
their carry out is the best”
As you'd guess from the legs, this species is called the Pale White.
It's a new Olympic Water Sport. . Shark Attack.
It started out as a bump on my fin.
Grubhub. I was tired."
They call it treading water.
They tell me I'm part of the cutting edge of surfing.
Sometimes I really wish I hadn’t gone vegan
What can I say? My stomach, like my heart, is full.
He's an intern in my law firm's summer program.
The idiot thinks I am a dolphin!!
Don't ask, he's paying me.
I have the answer to, “What’s for dinner tonight?”
I think he's getting ready to jump the shark!
My plan is to take him six feet under.
Cool hat Mark.
Grubhub delivery - did you order one whole swimmer and a coke?
Yes. I am relaxing, Master, I am taking slow breathes in and out of both gills...I feel like a peaceful swaying kelp flower..... but I still want to bite something.
do i have something on my back?
It's just that I'm not that hungry right now.
Should I?
This model really works! Get ready for a feast when all the rescuers show up.
Seriously.  What did you do with his surfboard?
I hate lawyers!
It’s similar to a monkey on my back but easier to get off.
I ordered my meal “to go.”
It's called fashion, Carl.
He’s a Trump supporter
He is an instagram influencer. Says he can improve my click bait numbers.
It's great as bait, but the temptation to snack on it is killing me.
Who him? His name is Fonzi.
It’s like shooting one of us in a barrel.
My shrink says I keep giving up my power.
If your father sees you playing with humans again he’s going to bite your head off
I know, but I felt sorry for the skinny bastard.
So next I flip it up into the air and catch it in my jaws.
I ate his surf board  and he says I owe him."
Hey look at me!  I’m Carmen Miranda.
We're bringing dessert.
I picked it up on my way back from the keys, hopefully it'll go away on its own.
This gig economy is killing me.
The weather is getting warm and this is my first swimmer of the season.
After biting a chunk out of his surfboard, I thought that I owed him.
I guess this guy never saw Jaws!
Everyone takes advantage of vegans.
He seems so comfortable I can’t bear to disturb him by rolling over and eating him yet.
He's underwater financially and I want to be the lone shark.
It's my turn to have the top portion.
You take the left one and I’ll  take the right.
They said 'Nice board shorts,' but he heard 'nice bored sharks.'
He's not heavy, I ate his brother!.
Get washed up. Dinner's on the table.
I'm willing to go halfsies.
I find it causes less of a fuss than the fin.
I just can’t seem to get this monkey off my back.
If I eat him I'll lower my IQ score by 50.
Damn global warming...
I'm his balance trainer, heh, heh.
I ordered it this morning on Amazon.
I pick them up for Uber, but I drop them off for Uber Eats.
There's too much news going around that sharks rarely bite humans.
Shark surfing, it’s a thing.
Have you seen the wife?
I was catfished.
My agent says it might help our image.
He will soon find out he's not on a sandbar.
I was fine with it till he started with the theme music.
He’s with me.
It's a living.
Dark or light?
I hate to burst his bubble.
You're right, he's going to owe me one.
Yeah, ok, fillet of sole.
We have been here for 50 million years and all of a sudden these guys are stepping on us and scream bloody murder if we bite them.
It's called Shark Lyft, and no you are not going to bite into my profits.
This attracts more snacks than letting  my fin stick above the water.
Soon he'll not have a leg to stand on.
Just until my periscope gets back from the repair shop.
It’s the El Chapo dorsal attachment. Gets a better reaction than the fin.
You Frank? Good, here's your Scuber Eats delivery.
This vegan diet is for the birds!
Reparations.
It pays the bills.
I mean as if the tagging wasn't bad enough.
I joined Lyft. This gig economy is getting me down.
I prefer mine with ketchup.
It’s Trump! He can’t swim !
Come on in ... I’m standing up!
I'm cutting my portions in half.
My dermatologist tells me it is nothing to be concerned with.
I can't decide to eat him or keep him as my personal masseuse. I must admit it feels good!
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?
You know I am a vegan, Jessica.
Apparently it is a form of extreme surfing. Let's hope it doesn't catch on
Where's Katy Perry?
Dude thinks he's Aqua-man.
They've become a lot more brazen since that cute baby shark song.
The jerk thinks I'm a coral reef- what the hell could I do??!
I thought this was a potluck!
But I like to play with my food!
Well, at least we're not at Sea World.
We’re not allowed to bite until he learns to tread water.
It's a Finn.
Well at least he’s no longer skateboarding.
Ask him to move back and to the right.
So, I see yours jumped the shark.
They gave me honorable mention for the ‘Family Beach Camouflaged Hat’ category.
They're better marinated.
What do you mean I have food on my face?
Unfortunately we do not have a leg to stand on.
I am a stand in for Shark Week
We call the service “Unter.”
It's called 'symbiosis' Jim.
Wanna give him a pedicure?
I have a feeling 'Jaws 5: Shark Surfer' is going to flop!
Don't even ask where I got this, I'm fed up with you always copying my style.
I told you going vegan was a bad idea.
He said we could switch after 5 minutes. Its been 20
I'm keeping an eye on that undertoe.
This is what it takes to be a Superhost.
My wife wants me to save money. I'm taking my lunch to work.
I thought volunteer work would be easy
Just let it go, Josh. The poor bastard is up there screaming 'California Dreaming' at the top of his lungs.
I'm having a lot of trouble adjusting to this new balanced diet.
He’s worse than a lamprey!
Damn millennials.
You're so late that I decided to start lunch without you.
How about we split 50-50?
I ordered carry out, and they  served me the counter man.
No, he can’t hang ten.
I always get mine "to go."
Which half do you want?
My therapist thinks I should strengthen my collaborative spirit.
It's the latest; UBER du Mer. I set my own work schedule. After training I received a discount card for seal sushi and if the client is overly abusive I can eat the them.
I know! I know! I lost a bet!
Guess we'll have to go a little deeper for privacy, dear.
He came into the Tank promising his “patent pending” online beachwear had amazing sales and growth.  Now I’m literally keeping him afloat.
I love getting my weekly shiatsu!
And then they blame us for going after their legs...
People give me a headache
I can set my own hours and don't need a medallion.
I love posing as a sandbar before dinner.
This new diet is crushing me with everything I can't eat
Hurry and take a pic for my Instagram page!
He's a dentist. Can he fix my bite?
Well, at least I'm employed.
That's the last time I'll make a wager with Jimmy Buffett.
He said his Grandfather was on the Indianapolis, that's why.
He's ours. You bring the avocado and I'll bring the cilantro.
I lost a bet with him, sucks, embarrassing.
He just had to prove he was on top of the food chain.
The waters getting warmer, and I actually hope it’s climate change
Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
'Extreme surfing,  it's going to be the next big thing.'
Maybe I was a dolphin in my past life!
He's head and shoulders above the rest.
It's Michael Ovitz...I'm helping him with his comeback
Actually, I'm waiting until dinner time.
His wife said to surprise him.
Grown up shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo …
I see this as a glass half empty/glass half full dilemma.
He ain’t heavy, he’s my chum
I must be stressed. I'm feeling more weight on my shoulders than ever before.
Why do I always get stuck with the drumsticks?
I’d eat his foot but it smells bad.
This will be his last selfie
He didn’t get the memo - it’s JUMP the shark idiot!
Do you think he can surf with one leg?
But my back was killing me.
He thinks he’s in the shallows.
I brought it home, you get it ready for dinner.
You should see the other half.
I know, I know, but I like the way his toes tickle my back.
He said he's got an idea to get us on "Shark Tank."
This second job as an Uber driver is really breaking my back.
I'm giving him a leg up before I take it.
Surfers!
I like a bit of ashiatsu massage before dinner.
If I flip him, I get first dibs.
Kiss me and I will Share.
Get paid to advertise on your head”
As soon as I get hungry he won't have a leg to stand on.
White meat - again!
Just wait, he won't have a leg to stand on.
This vegan diet is driving me crazy.
He promised that I  would star in the remake of “Jaws”.
It beats trying to use my fin for the itch on my back.
It's this new thing called Uber Shark. You should sign up.
I'm so sorry honey. I couldn't find a chubby one this week.
I'm a rebel, Ma. I'll play with my food.
So, now I'm a loan shark.
Yes, I am STILL working on it!
Let's see how they like it when we take one of their Finns
He thinks he's on solid footing... watch this.
I cannot say he won’t be eaten.
Uber shark, my ass.
White meat or dark meat?
So I was just swimming around flossing my jaws with a trash sign that read “Rides for food” when his idiot just hopped on me. You wanna do lunch?
Ashiatsu, followed by a protein snack, usually uplifts me from the slough of despond.
I think he needs glasses.
The worst part is being taken for granted.
Here, you can have the bottom half.
Get Spielberg on the line. He needs to make another one
It's totally copasetic. I get the surfers, he gets their boards.
About 80,000 calories, wanna split it?
Don't tell me you thought he really walked on water
Would you trim a little off the top?
Please, Doc! You gotta help me get this monkey off my back!
Your turn for "William Tell"
Did you tell him we charge for rides?
I’ve already had my day’s limit. Any interest?
I make chum change, but it’s a steady gig.
Hor d'oeuvres at 5:00 PM OK?
Thought he could jump the shark!
I never leave without a packed lunch on my back.
He thinks he's having a fabulous ride on his surfboard
It is called Ride Sharing.
I like mine semi-dry, shaken, not stirred.
Your turn, I need to go down
Professional courtesy, he’s an attorney.
He'd better not start peeing...
Well, how did YOU think he walked on water, Ezekiel?
I didn’t know what having a monkey on my back really meant...
I decided to try the new take-out spot everybody’s been raving about.
Incredible balance and breathe control.
Love your morsel fin
He asked if he could just stick around to so show his girlfriend”
It worked! Here comes his buddy!
Sorry I can't fish with you today; he doesn't know how to swim.
Ugh . . . what fresh hell is this?
You can eat him after he’s done giving me a back rub.
That does it! I'm moving outta his wifi range.
I think it’s time for a remake of jaws.
This seal mistook me for a surfboard.
I’m in anger management therapy.
His feet tickle
‘’This is when my psychology degree comes in handy,let him think he’s the one in control  and his friends will want to join him.’’
Here's betting he never saw Jaws
Well, how do you carry “take-out”?
Lyft wasn't kidding about inclusion!
Scram! After he takes the selfie, he's my lunch.
The best I could manage is a visual decoy.  We are still working on a human call.
Just be honest with me, how bad does it look?
I know... I know it's unbecoming....  but the dude has a wicked Oriental foot massage technique.
Thanks to global warming, Sharq is the new Lyft.
He’ll attract the tastier ones
This is what I get for eating his board.
I  gave him a choice. Be my periscope, or be my lunch.
'Dolphin gigs pay.'
If my daddy could see me now.
I felt guilty for taking a bite out of his surfboard
Whadd ya mean , 'four squid is TOO much for a skinny one'? You do the shopping next time.
He thinks he's riding the crest of success.
It’s professional courtesy- he’s a lawyer who got in over his head.
Yes, Uber is hiring.
It's that damned "Baby Shark" song I blame for ruining our reputation
My job is to catch the guys who don't get the metaphor.
He's just a chum.
I took him to Key West and now he wants to go to Mara Lago
He’s from Sea World
You're right.  It is a bit like shiatsu.
I could eat. All I had today was a bagel.
Pilot fish are so passé
Hang Ten?  How about Eat One
The doctor says it’s just a cyst.
I wasn’t that hungry so I’ll finish it later.
Dinner's on the table.
Periscope up!
Uber is thinking of expanding into new markets
I like working for Uber Eats.
Do you want the legs? I'm not a fan of dark meat.
If they take a selfie and don’t tag me, I eat them.
No Bob, it’s called ashiatsu massage.
Can you feel bone spurs
Technically, I caught him first !!
As soon as this guy gets off my back, we'll have that duel.
Should've voted for Beto.
It's called 'yoga'.  I hear the humans do it with goats in Portland.
Jaws wouldn't let this stand.
I'm just really full right now.
Did anyone order Scuba Eats?
I work as a tourist trap.
I call it a periscope.
I'm saving this half for later.
Now do you believe I used to work at Sea World?
I can raise the average IQ in this ocean during lunch.
Jaws is finally out of syndication.
This is why I'm always humming "Duh-dumb, duh-dumb" before I eat these things.
Apparently the 'live surfboard' - thing is a trend now.
Well, it's a living...
I packed a lunch today.  You?
I blame hoverboards.
Damn. Always when I’m meditating. Can you get this one?
Well it’s better than being shark fin soup.
I'm stuffed after that last swimmer, but please, feel free to help yourself.
He just made partner.
We'll have leftovers for dinner, is that O K with you?
Because then I'd have to find a new chiropractor, genius.
I considered Lyft, but Uber gets me more business.
It's like Uber, for sharks.
What ever happened to the thrill of the hunt?
It's not my taste but I got it half off.
New hood ornament.
Bad timing  for us starting that vegetarian diet, Marshall.
Where's baby shark?
I think it's a wishbone. Make a wish and on the count of three ...
I'm scared - he's a loan shark!
If only this guy knew how "in over his head" he really is.
He raised me from birth.
I like to marinate my meat first.
So he doesn't realise he's standing on shaky ground.  Are you going to tell him?
White man’s always keepin’ me down, man.
Apparently this is the new tracking tag system.
Enough of this, Are you ready to make a trade?
So, okay, Mom, I turned Vegan - you gonna tell Dad?
I'll give this guy 10 seconds to get off my back!
Well sure, it's embarrassing, but if Clara found out I've eaten between meals I'd never hear the end of it.
I haven't the heart to let him know I'm not a rock.
They always taste better without a struggle.
Do I have a parasite on my back?
It’s a new anti man-eating intervention program.
Here’s your meat order!
I know, I know. "Don't play with your food."
Wait'll he decides to step off!
There's a new sushi takeout sandbar – off the west end of the pier.
It’s simple: you take one, I take the other, and each of us makes a wish.
Ok, I'm trying to get with the new "Kindness PR" thing for sharks, but this is way too irritating!
Great for your back, though
Better than that shiatsu chair I bought.
Let me finish rehearsing for my audition at Sea World first.
And then when back feels better,  you eat it!
Uber Boat may pay the bills, but nothing beats Uber Eats.
Seriously?"  "I know... I just didn't have the heart to tell him...
He keeps calling me “Flipper” too.
He aint heavy. He's my brother.
Would you like to invite him for dinner, or shall I?
I've never recovered from life at Sea World.
He's an apex predator. What else am I supposed to do?
Sorry, I’ve gone keto.
Kevin, please don’t tell my dad...
I believe I was a surfboard in a previous life.
In my previous life as a dog, I learned to balance treats on my nose.
He requested one last selfie.
They ran out of doggie bags.
He feeds me.
This politically correct thing is starting to grate
I thought this kind of stuff ended when Steve Irwin died.
It's Mueller. He's riding it out.
I’ve always wanted to be a dolphin.
Don't laugh, that itch was driving me crazy.
You know, I've heard of white privilege but this is ridiculous.
He has no idea !
I just don't have the heart to move. He thinks I'm a sandbar.
He thinks this is the shallow end and I don't have the heart to tell him.
He's not heavy, he's my brother.
People are friends, not food.
I am regretting being a pescatarian...
Is there something on me?
Fishing. Can you believe it?
I would have eaten fewer of them had I known how good it feels to have them walk on my back.
Jeez Bob. The boss has been on my back all week!
The stand-up paddleboard craze has brought me a lot of new clients.
Humans are friends, not food Jim.
Support sharks are allowed now."
Got any ketchup?
Our dining experience just isn't the same. He hasn't looked up from his phone once.
Yes it's stylish, but the screaming is starting to bother me.
No cafeteria for me - I brought my lunch.
After we eat him, we can
 break the wishbone.
Let's split it...one leg each.
I think that's President Trump looking for his golf ball.
Stopped smoking weeks ago but there is still a monkey on my back.
This guy must have gills of steel. I've been trying to drown him for hours.
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water.
I'm tired of dining on all of these free loaders."
He says it’s symbiotic, but I feel like he’s walking all over me.
When it's my turn, I'll have him stick his head in my mouth.
He's all yours. I'll be the dolphin this time.
I’m full. I thought I’d  leave the rest for you.
Soon he'll have to change his name to Bob.
He gave up standing on principle long ago.
His Thai massage is to die for!
Uber and Lyft pay better, but maybe he’ll hang ten
I don't like this job either, bit it pays the rent.
I can’t seem to get this monkey off my back,Stan.
I saw him first!
Let's grab lunch.
They are calling it Scuber.
He got 'Standing on the shoulder of giants' all wrong.
Well, there are benefits for me too.
I said, "Okay, sure you can swim with the sharks, but who the hell gave them permission to stand on us?"
It may look demeaning, but I'm told it's called 'rideshare'.
The joke’s wearing fin.
He wants one last selfie.
Show a little professional courtesy to a lawyer, then what?
Let him post a few selfies first.
Jaws" Guilt...
I'll play along for now
I'm not exactly getting paid for the shoot, but I'll get a vignette in the special features.
He's an "ocean half full" kinda guy.
Have you seen the guy with the tasty looking legs?
Just wait ‘til he tries 
to hang-ten.
He’s my midnight snack.
It's the latest new spa package - Thai massage, then lunch.
Don't tell the guys, but I volunteer at You-Can-Swim on Fridays.
These Shark Week photographers are getting pretty bold.
He started with with praise and small fishes just like he did with the Orcas.
So, I launched into my Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry impersonation.  I said 'you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?'  Epic non reaction. Zip, zero, nada."
Why do you think he keeps saying, "I am proud to stand on the shoulders of those who came before me!"?
The feet feel really nice but I’m conflicted about the nature vs nurture thing.
Lunch? No! It's Seaworld's first rodeo.
It's not deep.....
This is why I'm hoping a Jaws reboot gets greenlit
Trust me, it's better than my last job.
I can’t believe you DON’T have one, Trevor. It’s the latest fashion.
We'll attack after he posts his selfie.
They're calling it "sharking."
What do you mean, what’s in it for you?
I haven't been eating between meals.
Mine's to go.
Lighten up, it's casual Friday.
I can't eat him he owes me money, so I'm forced to carry him for awhile.
If he shouts "Cowabunga!" one more time he's an appetizer.
This is the worst back massage I've ever gotten in my life.
I'm sick of this topping.
When I volunteered to be a "support" animal, I thought it meant emotional support.
Get out of the way, I need five stars for this ride.
It's a new fad with a huge downside
The kids wanted takeout.
What are you looking at? Human bait is the new cologne.
False sense of security, and then breakfast.
Of course I'm hesitating--I was a broker in my previous life.
He won the Shark Tank, and I lost.
Yeah, I know. Humans and their last wishes
He thinks he’s walking on water.
Pet humans suck!
I'm just giving him a false sense of security.
Ever heard of the Marshmallow Test?
If you can't eat 'em, buoy 'em.
Yeah, but the pay is good.
It's my lawyer, he's like family.
And we look nothing like surfboards.
Yes, but I’m a lot more tempted when he hangs ten.
They really are atop of the food chain?
The top half was tasty, but the bottom is stuck on my fin
It was funnier in the conception than the execution.
I just can't bring myself to do it. It feels soooo good.
I'm going to be late tonight. ...my boss has been on my back all week.
I don't know what it is got into me made me discover my compassionate nature somehow...
It sucks being vegan.
He hasn’t  seen the movie yet!
We gotta start targeting these millennials.
I like a balanced diet.
Human interaction really weighs me down.
'Super Glue."
I'm going to give him a few more minutes,  then it's lunch time.
It’s almost too easy nowadays.
He pays $500 a month in rent.
Swimming with dolphins was one thing, but surfing with sharks...?
I don't think I can tolerate this guys white privilege much longer.
I was raised in Seaworld.
Thought I’d get a foot massage before dinner.
Too easy.
Where's the respect.
Just bringing some leftovers to a potluck.
I rented myself out as a floatation device. Imagine his surprise when he gets the bill.
Professional courtesy to lawyers
Frank Buckley Andover, MA
At least with Scuber I get to set my own hours.
Our relation is somelike long distance relation but more itimate.
I'm training him to attract bait.
Welcome to Long Island, where they used to fear us
Did you order the human?
You ordered Jake tartare?
My therapist said to keep calm but...he's really pushing my limits here
A stand in for JAWS
Did you eat the top half?
Do we really want to attack the last member of the species that doesn't believe in global warming?
It's the new ride share called aqualyft.
I’ll split him with you if you get him off my back
I knew I shouldn't have become a vegetarian...
Take-out for lunch
He thinks I’m Flipper, lol
Yeah! They’re not even as meaty  as the chicken wings down at  The Ocean Club.
ewwwmooommmmm! getitoffgetitoffgeitofffffff!!!
Once you deliver them to their destinations, you get to eat 25%.
He has a long-running television show that’s about to make no sense.
I caught this one off the coast oF Long Island
The flailing is more inspired when they're well rested.
It's a little demeaning, but my small business is thriving.
Too lean for me. Wanna try a bite?
Harvard Law. I'm stuck with him for the next twelve weeks.
I’m packing a lunch.
Just download the app: It’s “sharx” with an “x”
So I started driving for SCUBER  .
I mean I’m back and forth anyway.
it's like their marshmallow test, Dear... just eat him right now and risk the beach closing down...or wait 15minutes and feast when all his idiot buddies join!
He thinks he can still touch here. At this point I don’t know how to leave.
Next time I`ll go for the deep tissue, instead of the Thai massage.
The hard part was finding a taxidermist for this trophy.
What he can't see can't hurt him.
Watch me do a 180 and end this stand up paddle boarding craze forever.
He thinks he is on his surfboard!
Did you call UberEats?
They would call it chum.
Uber went under.
You smell something fishy?
The invitation said "Bring you own food".
It's a steady gig until they get the L train fixed...
Wanna' see something funny?
Are you a Nurse Shark?
He's gonna need you
Nah, this one's an hors d'oeuvre.
Adjusts my cartilage, then he's a snack. What's better than that!
The last time I ate legs like that,I became a vegetarian.
I hate when they don’t bring the food all at once, please, go ahead....
I ate his surf board and this is what the judge came up with.  It's only on the weekends until i can come up with the cash.  But you can eat him if you want...
First they came for the whales...
Slim pickens this season.
Are you ready to make a wish?
Lay off Killer. Our PR has been terrible since Jaws.
I wish they’d cut their toenails.
The polls say it makes me less threatening.
The hardest part is giving up human.
If this is what he thought they meant by 'swimming with the sharks', I'm going to show him what it means to put 'foot in mouth'.
Vegan sucks.
Hazel stared in stony silence. Once again George brought home the dark meat, having selfishly eaten all the white meat on the way home.
Yes I know, for 400 million years we were the undisputed apex predators, but pasty-leggs here is a cutthroat big Pharma lobbyist!
Listen, I’m sick of this Circue de Soleil stuff. It’s your turn!
Well this can't make my scoliosis any better.
I've got a bite.
He took a thorn out of my paw.
Dude, make him hang five
It's not what you think!
I don't want to drive Uber forever, but it pays the bills for now.
I’ll admit, Uber Surfing is a niche market, but lunch is free.
I can't talk now.  My food is burning.
How about this, he thinks he can get a free ride.
Stupid humans - in over their head and they never know it!
It's community service
He followed me home; can I keep him?
I know it's unconventional, but it really helps loosen up my back.
It's called symbiosis, Barry. I get a back massage and he gets to not be lunch.
This is the next step after swimming with dolphins. It's also the last step.
My doctor said I need to have a more balanced diet.
Humans...it's like they're trying to get eaten
He said he’s a fascinator.
He's outside my HMO coverage,but what he does for my dorsal pain is worth it's weight in seal.
Okay, but I only sold out to A man, not THE man.
Its an experiment, see if we can develop a symbiotic relationship.
I deal with this every year during Shark Week
Supposedly the adjustments will help with my lower fin issues. We'll see.
I am planning on a light lunch.
I keep telling him he's going to need a bigger shark.
He will be de-feeted!
He says he's The Fonz and he's going to ruin television forever.
This joker is about to get a food chain lesson he'll never forget.
It's part of the corporate training they're making us do called Being the Master of Your Impulses or some such b.s. like that.
He used to keep a lookout perched on someone else's gigantic tail.
Of course I could eat him. But you forgot I’m a vegan.
Life at the aquatic park sure isn’t Jaws, is it?”

Robert Van Brocklin, Portland, Ore
I hear this all started with goat yoga.
I'm using him as bait for something meatier
HE THOUGHT THEY SAID BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, NOT SHARK
That's it. I'm so done entertaining people at SeaWorld.
You want a Piece of this?
He just said come on in the water's fine. Tell the kids dinner will be ready in two minutes."
They tell me it will improve my sex life.
This is my final test in my weight loss management course.
The stupid ones taste terrible!
I have no qualms about eating something that stupid.
Sorry, I forgot the milk.
This new yoga is all the rage...humans climb on your back.
Yeah, I know how it looks, but Dolphin World was the only one hiring.
Seriously, how did we manage before Instagram?
What... like you don't have any fetishes?
I told you I'd get a leg up on you.
I thought it looked nice... But if you really hate it that much, I’ll return it.
I'm his Uber Pool.
Don’t say a word...he was dog paddling and got tired, what was I suppose to do?
Sure, take it.  But the upper half gave me gas.
Where would you like to have dinner tonight?
I always thought that "headstand" was something different!
I brought my lunch today.
Don't laugh, it keeps the dorsal fin from showing. I can get super close before they realize I'm about to attack.
I prefer the pilot fish cleaning
So I figured, what the hell, why not moonlight as a Segway?
This one is a slam-dunk. I dunk him. You slam him.
Karl, don't play with your food.
Ocean Uber Eats
But I do kinda admire his chutzpah
I'll do dinner tonight.
He won’t swim with us. He says wading is safer.
I’m working PR for Animal Planet
Amuse-bouche?
I've had this persistent headache since shark surfing became a trend.
Just let them think you're a dolphin. We'll catch more that way.
It's called a Watsu massage, it was developed by some hippie in California.
His fearless naivety was so endearing I couldn't eat him.
Wait!  He says his older brother will be bigger and tastier than he is.
Go ahead and laugh, I'm trying out a 'Stand Up' comedy routine
In five minutes time he won't have a leg to stand on
Its not my fault it you didn't pack a lunch
That's what happens when you go vegan.
I just can’t shake the addiction ! They’re so delicious, but a bitch to clean !
I'm just waiting for it to marinate.
You're late! Dinner's getting cold
I just ate, so I'm keeping him for tomorrow.
The hindquarters are not kosher.
... and they think they are at the top of the food chain.
Obviously he hasn't seen Jaws"...
Yeah, he wants to settle down but you know me. I have to keep moving.
He’s holding my phone.
One Man's Uber is another Shark's Grubhub.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying."
I bit his surfboard in half and this is part of the settlement.
Is this a good wishbone or what?
Let's just say he's my wingman.
Stay calm. They can smell your fear of extinction within their personal bubble.
I signed up for Lyft and Uber.
Never fails. These inflatable humans always manage to scare the baby sharks.
Best bobbing-head doll I’ve ever had!
Do I tell him?
I know, I know, but he promised me lots of krill.
Don't look at me that way. Lyft is expanding and it's a job with a 401(k) plan.
What? You've never had chicken legs before?
My overbite is the problem.
I thought I'd pack a lunch for the beach.
For dramatic effect I have him make the “dunn dun, dunn dun” noise as I approach the shore.
My Anger Management class suggests de-escalation but maybe submerging would be better.
You’re acting like you’ve never seen a Hammertoe shark before.
He won’t be able to keep his head above water in this economy.
It helps with the cravings.
What? I can't get a massage once in a while?
My favorite, swimmer surprise!
I never go anywhere without a snack.
Yeah, but if I get hungry, I just dive.
This is EXACTLY what it looks like.
Well, he's a lawyer so its a professional courtesy thing.
Yeah, but have you seen the hair on his back?
I am so loosing teeth over this new ride-share app.
I don't think he understands the whole "jumping the shark" thing.
Should I tell him I ate his paddle board?
I picked the wrong time to be a vegetarian
What did you do with the other half?
We're hoping to go viral.
I hate working at Sea World.
I’m letting him rest for a moment, they say it makes the meat more tender.
He thinks he's standing on the sand. Should we tell him?
It was this or becoming shark-skinned shoes.
I've heard they taste better with a squeeze of lemon.
We’ll both die if I stop moving.
I like them sunburnt!!
Do you think he's gluten-free?
What about this is supposed to be relaxing?
I'm using him a bait.
Take over for me,  Will you? I’ve just got to get a bite to eat.
i left you half.
I just feel bad for the ones who can't even swim.
Jesus is up to his old tricks again.
When I ate his surfboard, I didn't know he was a lawyer.
He keeps telling me he’s Brian Wilson, so...
But,I saw him first !
He was a surfer, I missed.
My therapist told me it would help with developing patience
yeah,crazy huh? he mentioned something about a scorpion and a frog...
I'm conflicted...Am I Uber Ride Share or Uber food delivery ...?
You look different...did you do something with you fin?
I don’t care what he looks like.
He’s my son.
I don’t care what they say, this vegan diet really messes with the ecosystem.
It’s my periscope.
The seals never see me coming.
Your order is ready.
And heʻs singing the Baby Shark song
Because he lost his flippers.
Don't even think about it. It's called Thai massage and I've paid 20 bucks.
Hey, George, can you help me out?  Is this a pimple on my forehead?
I just ate breakfast at the 'Ride a Dolphin' attraction and picked us up some take-out.
Yeah, I can’t stand Shark Week either, Fred.
I am saving him -- for Lunch.
I wanted to have it removed, but insurance wouldn’t cover it.
I've been trying to save money by bringing my lunch to work.
Then why do I feel like I’m at the bottom-of-the-foot chain, Gary?
But Uber takes most of the fare. I keep almost nothing.
I just feel a need to make some kind of amends.
He’s taking a stand because I ate his uncle last month.
keepin' him alive and fresh until I'm hungry
How do I tell him?
I thought they said to pack a lunch???
I’ll eat him right after he’s done with my massage!
What, you've gone vegan now too?
It's a shame he didn't come with more legs.
Did you bring the Old Bay and butter?
They're from the gifted youth program
I'm keeping this one really fresh, perfect for a nice quiet lunch instead of the usual frenzy.
Does this hat make my fin look fat?
I'm a vegan."
I know what Charles Addams would have done.
He said this is more environmental than the traditional surfboard.
I’m full of climate changers. You do it.
Body surfing, on my body.
Don’t even.
Be still, he is calling for his friends to swim over this way.
I’m pretty sure it was Francine that gave him to me. Anyway I gotta be more careful when I’m drinking.
Don't you dare!
If it's smaller than a 10 wide, I throw it back."
I can’t believe you didn’t get the Aquaman 2 callback too.
It beats getting punched in the nose.
What?  He said he'd lure in some other swimmers if I didn't eat him.
Your wish has come true, that is Mark Cuban.
Who's left shark now!?
I'll eat him after the water polo championships
Does this human make me look fat?
yeah I bought it on Amazon!  Best lure ever!  Fake a drowning and a whole bunch more come for dinner!
I know, but it feels so good on my bad back.
Any idea what they mean by extreme surfing?
He likes to do his own stunts, okay?
It's the latest thing. It's called a "to go" snack.
They call it Unter, and, you know, it's a living.
Welcome to the REAL Shark Tank!
Bite this jerk for me, will you Sid?
200 hours of Community Service.
I am just carrying a snack with me.
I'm running him over to Martha's Vineyard and he promised to give me a toe.
No more messing with me—finally got my sea legs!
Of all the days to decide to become a vegetarian...
Making up for the one I ate"
Do you want the leftovers?
Now, it’s clear how Jesus performed the miracle of walking on water.
I brought a little snack. Would you like a bite?
And you call me spineless.
This is not what I meant when I said I needed a breather.
How are we handling walk-ups?
Okay, you're right. Americans are delusional. Let's eat
And if you stop moving, they'll give you a crappy review.
I don't want to bite him. YOU bite him.
I'm going to wait until he eats the snack box on the beach.
Hold my beer
Invitation said we're all supposed to wear party hats.
The minute I go plant-based...
I was typecast as “Jaws,” my career dried up and now I’m doing this.
I'm saving the bottom half for dessert.
I'm totally addicted to home delivery; the food is always warm, too.
This guy is very lucky that I'm not ticklish.
Perhaps a low I.Q. individual?
I needed a lift.
I find when I'm using a teenage bait I can land those lifeguards 1,2,3.
Its "Mr. Wonderful"  showing how to win in business.
After the massage I'll share a leg with you.
I thought 'getting then off your back' was just a manner of speaking!
Water taxi is my side hustle
You ordered the legs?
If he takes another step or two, he's saltimbocca.
Cheapest periscope on the market and likely tasty too
It's somewhat annoying but they taste way better when caught fresh.
What an idiot
You take the bottom half
They taste too un-fishy. Besides, where else can you get a massage?
I get the legs
Sure I want to eat him, but I have to maintain my 4.8 rating.
What can I do? He is a lawyer.
Well... haven’t you tried Noom?
And I thought remoras were annoying.
He promised to convince the swim class kids that it wasn’t that deep
It's a scab.  My pilot fish are on strike.
I'm trying a more balanced diet.
My back hasn't felt so good in years.
Just my luck, his feet stink to high heaven.
Do you really think a mosquito could kill more humans than a shark! No one should even care about bug spray in summer!
There’s not enough meat on those legs.
I guess goat yoga is passé.
It's called a side hustle.
He’s my first passenger. It’s an app called Grouper.
I made a deal. He’s on seal patrol.

Dan Barrett, Chatham, MA
And they say their higher on the food chain?
On weekends I make extra money with my ride-sharing app.
As soon as I finish with this massage, maybe we can stop for a bite.
He’s really not getting my drift.
I would eat this guy, but he's on my L3 and L5,  and dude, does that feel good or what!?
I hate to be a stereotype but will you bite him?
You familiar with The Marshmallow Test?
Tell me again why we are doing this"
They taste much better semi-dried
Before I rectify this situation, doesn’t it remind you of the old shark-lawyer-professional courtesy joke?
I threw him up and he's back.  Now what?
I call it Swyft - my new app based water taxi service.
Unfortunately, this is meatless Friday.
One, two, three, flip.
My client ignored the advice not to take the stand.
It's your turn to float around with him before we go to lunch.
Do you have any hot sauce?
Oh yeah right there. This guy really gets the kinks outta my dorsal.
He’s a lawyer. It’s professional courtesy.
How long do you think until he realizes he's not on his paddle board anymore?
I really miss our fridge.
It's great, I make extra money on my schedule and if you eat them at the end they can't give you a bad rating.
Hey - find your own elasmobranchii craniosacral shiatsu practitioner.
I guess one sandy surface feels like any other.
Your wife has you doing Meatless Mondays too, huh?
It's funny. He said he was drowning in student debt. Now he calls me his loan shark.
I like to give them a false sense of confidence.
I'm having it removed next week.
Go for it—I'm more of a breast shark.
I thought I had tops.
Not for just anyone. He's a good chum.
I thought only elephants had trunks.
Why am I giving him a joy ride? He gets relaxed and the meat will be tender!
Hey, gotta take advantage of the rising sea level.  I call it Süber.
Tell me the truth, does this dad hat scream hipster?
I'm a surfboard.  This is my life now.
He got on at Coney Island !
We're shooting 'The Sponge Bob Jaws Movie.
It’s a symbiotic relationship so back off.
He's on thin ice, well, was on thin ice.
I've been working for Green Surfboard for a year now.
If the rest is anything like the legs, he’s all yours.
Apparently jumping the shark is now passe.
This guy thinks I am one of those new powered surfboards.
I know, I know. I'm too aggressive-passive.
It’s a new X-Game sport... sharkboarding.
I’m helping out with the shark watch.”
I’m making human leg soup.
Let's share.
Wait till he discovers he”s not standing in the shallows.
Standing room only at the Jaws Fest.
We have a symbiotic relationship - he claims to be eco-friendly not needing a boat and I get human prey easily
I decided to have my lunch to go today.
It’s the opposite of stepping on a Lego
My lawyer's pulling rank.
When you asked me if I would be your stand in, I didn’t think it meant this.
I accidentally ate his surf board. I was either this, or ... do you know how expensive those things are?
I can’t get that Baby Shark song out of my head.
Mom, I’m a dolphin
I liked it more when they were in the cages.
the bottom half never tastes as good as the top half
I’m not hungry, but this is too good of an opportunity to pass by.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t it your idea to order in tonight?
I get my dinner to go.
It pays the rent...
I'm carrying my food on my back............he's my "Snack Pak"!!
I can't. Just started paleo.
He's a real pain in the back.
They call it fish boarding; I call it trolling.
Well, what's YOUR side gig?
Do you prefer a leg or a thigh?
The trick is not to rush.  Soon, more will come.
Who let this guy into their PhD program?
Hey Sal, go up and see how fast this one can swim.
I'm not that hungry, do you want to split it?
Says he's a TV writer and needs to learn fast, how to 'jump the shark'.
It's all about the optics.
I’m trying shiatsu for my migraines.
I'd say he's a foot and a half from disaster--maybe two feet.
I’d eat him but he’s a vegan
How was I supposed to know he was Neptune’s nephew?
I get a good back rub AND lunch.
Whadda think of my new hat?
I’m part of a new Uber service
Hey, I don’t see you having any luck finding a job
Wait until you see him, he's scarier than my dorsal fin could ever be.
There's really nothing as satisfying as Ashiatsu barefoot back massage.
It’s a great bait
I wish it was a lamprey.
Take out.
I'm teaching him how to jump the shark
I told him I was a dolphin in disguise.
You can't let people walk all over you.
I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like if I say something, that makes me the rude one.
On the other hand, if I do dispose of him, I'll never get rid of those pesky remoras.
How long is a water polo match?
He double-dared me not to eat him.
UberOcean
Harry. Get it. Get it. It's 'surfing turf!'
It’s my new start up. I call it ‘Under Eats’.  You think it has fins?
You should consider getting a human masseuse too. This back-walking is really aligning my chakras.
His tattoo says “Babe Magnet” so I have an idea...
He needs work on his sea legs.
He also wears a pair of Crocs.
Humiliating work but they cover dental.
The store was fresh out of periscopes.
I hate being a support animal.
Gerald, Stop playing with your food!
I have this kink in my cartilage.
The "Coral Seas" now has take-out.
My internist recommended daily back-walking spinal manipulations to release stress-related dorsal fin tension.
It's an investment, he is posting on Instagram.
Actually, George, I'm swimming for a peer-to-peer ridesharing app called SurfSerfs.
Perhaps Darwin was right.  This guy claims he is my Uncle Bill.
It's this damn great white guilt.
I'm trying to eat smarter.
It's that cocky Roy Scheider!
It's cheaper than a chiropractor.
Here's your delivery, thanks for using UberEats.
It's supposed to help with headaches.
My kind of restaurant. Standing room only.
Growth? What growth?
They're better when you marinate them.
I had not choice -- they were out of the small size hood ornament
When he jumped onboard he kept calling me Uber.
No thanks, I don't need to go out for lunch.  I brought mine.
He said "professional courtesy". I want to bite him.
This 'Vegan Shark' ploy is brilliant, Bruce.  Just two more days..."
Do I look like a pig to you?
He tried to jump the shark, but missed
Do you know what it's like to be stuck with Richard Dreyfuss
After synchronized swimming, I'm having him for dinner.
He's looking for Spielberg. He works for me.
He thinks he’s in surfing school.
Parasite Laws are Horrible!
Another whale watcher.
Have you seen the movie, Jaws?
Go look -- it feels like a set-up.
Let's wait until he's finished texting.
I told the wife I'd bring home dinner.
My wife said we’re going vegan.
It’s called “Sea Uber”. I’m taking this one to Montauk.
Migrate early, they said.
It’s my side hustle.
If I let you take a bite it will ruin my rating.
Split him now and nosh later?
And I'm telling you: It's my turn now. He's been doing you for nearly an hour.
I brought a snack.
I don't have the heart to tell him that he won't have a leg to stand on.
INFESTED with humans, more like.
They're too stupid to eat.
No Jerry, I don't like you're new hat.
Hi, honey--I brought dinner.
It's a great gig.  Uber Waterways lets us join the labor pool.
Well, I get great back massages and luckily for him, it curbs my appetite.
They're actually worth more alive than dead.
Just a Big Pharma exec who needed a professional courtesy
I'm trying to be dolphin-like, but I should just be myself.
I order them for take-out.
Are you going to help me fish for lifeguards or what?
Brought some lunch.
Lunch is so easy this time of year
no, you can't have the legs again.
Don't eat him - this back massage is doing wonders for neck pain.
He gets a ride for free and I get another set of eyes.
Yeah, but you should see what I did to his surfboard.
I don’t care if he is a big shot attorney, this professional courtesy thing has gotten out of hand.
Apparently shark surfing is the new trend.
Meh. They taste like chicken.
He thought he was appearing ON Shark Tank! Heh
Nobody fears us since "Baby Shark Doo Doo" came out.
I have the profile of a surfboard.
Ya wanna come over for some leftovers?
I’m waiting until dinnertime.
I never though massage therapy was this good,Bob
I’d eat him, but he’s scratching an itch.
Yeah, just until the end of August, then I start work with a big carporation.
It is such a hassle bringing your own food to the beach.
He's annoying me but I just ate.  Have you eaten yet?
Another twenty seconds and I get to scratch his.
It's amazing what you can pick up body surfing the net these days...
Best bait ever for Long Island Sound.
Oh yeah? Let's see YOU swallow a surfboard in one bite!
This actually helps relieve a lot of tension on my dorsal.
I’m saving it for an afternoon snack.
I had to take a 2nd job as a lyft driver.
Don’t do it, Sid. Remember what Mom said. Those things’ll cause splinters in your throat.
Once I land my Netflix special I'll quit UberEats.
Don't touch, I'm working.  How else did you think these dumb humans participate in Synchronized Swimming."
I'm a level 5 vegan.
Would you like to share lunch?
I'm thinking about the roll and snap maneuver.
You like it? I picked it up on vacation.
It's the new LIFT service.
They say it's good for your posture.
We met on Tinder. He thinks I'm of a plankton-eating variety.
I like to play with my food first . . . you?
I'm just waiting 'til lunchtime....
Welcome to Shark Tank, Mr. Johnson.
And I'm not even hungry now.
My guess is this moron never watched the movie Jaws!
It’s worth it for the massage.
In about 2 seconds: the 'sandbar' strikes back.
This dude thinks he’s windsurfing...
I'm waiting to see if the top-half is any more appetizing.
He kept humming this strange tune and saying he needed a bigger boat, do I decided what the heck, go all in."
Yes, I’m now employed  by Uber.
He's a stand-up type of guy.
Honey, you hungry? I brought home the leftover drumsticks.
Back off! Get your own surfwich!
Go away. We're a lone shark.
I wasn't very hungry, so I got half my lunch to go.
If I can't get a seal, he's my Plan B ...
Cause, he's Republican like me.
And I though remoras were a pain.
He was screaming and crying.  Then he gave up and started taunting me.  And I  lost my appetite.
I've changed a lot since my evil days as "Jaws".
He doesn't understand who the frog and who the scorpion is in this scenario
When it stops itching, then we'll eat.
Honey,I can’t get dinner off my mind.
It started a few months ago as a small bump on my back!
Hey Sushi, ready for lunch?
It’s the latest thing at my yoga studio.
Would sir like some lemon with his legs?
You gotta let them think they're in charge.
It's my new side hustle, Uber Surf.
Don’t judge.
ShUber. Don't judge me.
The doctor says it’ll clear up if I swim in colder waters.
It's for later.
The guy says he never read the Gingerbread Man.
I am bringing him home for dinner.
We have an arrangement. He runs a cruise line.
I get no respect.
It's take out dinner.
He thinks I'm his paddle board.
It's my sinuses. Feels like something is sitting on my face.
It's the reboot--he's too old now to actually make it over me.
You want the other half? I'm full.
What? Patience is a virtue.
I drive for Uber.  The money's not so good, but meals are free.
He says he has my back.
What was I to do? I ate his mother, and he needed a ride home.
I think you’re right. This is an  unanticipated shift in the service economy.
You just download the app.
Do you want the legs or the chest?
Personal Injury clients are always asking for support.
We can't bite him. Ecotourism is where the money's at.
He's lucky I've gone vegan.
He has 5 seconds to get off my fin!
But you said you couldn't 'stand' humans.
You can have him, he's gluten free.
It feels so good on my back I am not even hungry.
He thinks he's one of us - but he's just a flippin' lawer!
This way people  think he can walk on water.
It is called Uber and it pays quite well
Don’t. It’s not worth the publicity.
Give me a break.  I owe him one.  I ate his mother.
Wanna play 'wishbone'?
It's take out.
The chiropractor says two more weeks
I've felt so disrespected since the end of Shark Week.
He doesn’t know my favorite story is “The Gingerbread Man”!
el stupido here thinks he's jumped the shark!
I  just don’t think the free fish are worth it.
Your choice:  Chicken or bumpercars?
He gives great massages, and is cheaper and neater than a pygmy goat.
he's pitching a shark repellant on Shark Tank
I'm taking him home to meet my parents.
Are you okay with take-out?
I need to find a new job.
He didn't want me to be a lone shark.
He said he was looking for Crocs.
Oh I know, I'm saving it for later.
Aqua-Uber
He thinks we're friends. I'm waiting until he shows me off to the kids to strike.
He's pushing my vegan commitment to the limits.
I am interviewing for Sea World,will you be a reference?
Timing is everything.
You can  take his better half
Fresh and convenient
Call me Primitive!  I don't need a table and napkins for dinner.
I’m working for Uber. A bucket of chum gets them a trip to the island.
He thinks I'm a dolphin rescuing him.
This is getting too easy
I'll split him with you if you eat the pants.
He feels like jail bait
No thanks, I brought my lunch from home today."
A little to the left...aaaaahhhhh, that's it!
It's Japanese. It's called shiatsu.
I'll take him out past the surf-line,and we can all have a bite.
He says he's a lawyer and wants professional courtesy.
Did you order dinner delivered?
This new rideshare gig is a pain in the neck.
You want him? I gave up meat for lent.
Do you want him or not?
I usually don’t kiss and tell, but...
The script clearly says ‘Fonzie JUMPS the shark’, Karl... I don’t get paid enough for this crap.
Don't look at me like that! YOU had a monitoring device attached just last year!
Haven't you heard of the new gig economy?
I thought I would bring a snack for the trip.
It was you who suggested we try reiki
I think of him as an attractive nuisance...
Your Uber Eats order is ready.
He wants us to join his firm
Sure I like a challenge, but sometimes I’m just hungry.
Junior, I brought your supper
I asked "Scorpion?" "Frog?" He just smiled, so I told him to climb on...
I just wish the lifeguard would get off my back.
How long do we need to support this guy !
It's okay, he's The Fonz.
I'm not falling for it again.
I was burned out.  I am trying something meaningful.
Relax, there's no top part."
No, it’s not a symbiotic relationship.
My driver rating is 4.95. People love not being eaten.
This massage promises a happy ending - the question is whose?
The doctor said it would help with my lower fin
Want to split a dessert?
Each year it gets easier and easier.
It's been like this for an hour.
I would bite him, but I don't want to hurt his self-esteem."
Have you seen his top half?
Would you like to join me for lunch?
Now, watch while I flip this up and catch it in my mouth.
Just a little snack for later.
He’s watching out for people with hooks.
He says he likes living on the edge.
Really, I guess it comes down to your definition of "apex".
I get the feeling I've been stood up.
So, how shall I convince him that he doesn't have a leg to stand on?
I figure, use some bait.
I'm delaying gratification.
ok, the coast is clear.  It is your turn to go fish!
"Yeah, but the sciatica relief is unparalleled.
They had to evolve....
I'm saving this half for a mid-day snack.
Why do I always have to be your wing man?
"I'm giving him a lift to Amity.
Should we eat him now, or let him scream more?
I'm saving half for tomorrow's lunch.
We have a "You scratch my back, I'll remove your calluses" type of relationship.
What, I signed up to be a UBER driver.
I just didn't have the heart.
I don’t want to hear a word out of you.
I'm still top of the food chain, Frank. Yes, they call for a ride on the app, but I get to decide if I want to accept it.
Would you like to buy a human periscope?
Look dear what I brought home for dinner!
I’m working Uber and Uber Eats part-time — can’t recall which one this is.
Work-life balance — you should try it sometime.
I'm a loan shark, he'll pay for this!
He's my lookout for fin hunters.
My dorsal was itchy.
He's lucky we've gone vegan last week.
Guess who just joined the sharing economy?
Do these skinny legs make me look fat?
I try not to cause panics, but they really make it hard.
Why?  Because supposedly surfers taste gnarly and bitter, that's why.
I’m saving him for my afternoon snack.
The food chain is a bit screwed up.
Where can I get a pair of those Bermuda shorts?
I'm trying to improve our image.
The ad said ‘stable employment’...I shoulda known...
He said he needed a leg up; actually, he meant “two.”
Court orders ...!
He's happy keeping his head above water but I'm taking him for a ride!
I could eat.
I got five yelps from my last meal...ready to count?
Forget it! You don't stand a chance.
Hanging ten is no longer an option I’m afraid.
I  had no idea this was what pool shark meant.
He's ordering me the two for one tuna special in trade for a ride home.
I've got mine, you get yours
The Swedish was getting old. I decided to try Thai.
We’re just messing with the Lifeguard
Boston Harbor. Says I’m too expensive. Want him?
I just ate.  Do you want this son of a beach?
I know it's embarrassing, but times are tough and this Uber Scuber gig helps  a lot.
You didn't know I work for Lyft?
So Greg, you're saying the dumb ones don't taste as good?
Apparently it's a killer core workout."
He told me about a new kind of yoga, and I said: "Sure, my Dorsal's been killing me!"
I just feel weighted down.
It's what they call a foot massage.
When his swimming lesson starts, I get first dibs.
Honey, there's something that's been weighing on my shoulders.
This one needs to cook a little longer.
Say, aren't the chum portions getting larger?
We make less than even Uber drivers, so we take a bite of the customer.
He does wonders for my sciatica
I can’t eat him until I cash out of his hedge fund.
Brining and sun drying: salt, fat, acid, heat.  Don't you read?
Here's your Uber Eats order.
If this edible hat thing catches on I'll eat my hat
I've hated the beach since I first saw "Feet".
It's not that deep; I can still touch bottom!
Dinner tonight? I've got too much for just me.
I can barely pay the fish monger with the cash this UBER Stand Up Board gig brings in.
You want him head first or feet first?
It turns out, I really like surfing.
Don’t say that I never gave you anything”
Morally, I’m against the lifestyle.
But my back has never felt better.
He says it will rehabilitate our image and I get a week's engagement at SeaWorld.
Working for Uber as a side gig is helping me pay off my student loans.
You’ll get your sea legs someday.
There are some downsides to the gig economy but at least my schedule is flexible.
Is it leg day?
I brought him to share
Said he forgot his surf board!
Take him, I'm vegetarian!
I already ate the top half
This growth ruins my chances with the seals
Upper or lower?
He want  me to pick up another.  Invite the family over for dinner.
It's just my side-hustle.
Apparently, his name is "superego"...but who knows!
You told me you liked legs over easy!
Is it lunch time yet?
Disgusting.. it's a literal Jaws remake titled 'No Guts, No Glory.'
In Amity they say "shak."
Do you want to pants him or should I?
I kind of think of him as a sharknerdo.
It's been a long day, so I just ordered some takeout.
I'm sick of acting kind.
It causes way less chaos than a dorsal fin.
I know it's not much of role but "Companion Shark" was all they had for me today.
What did you do with rest of him?
I get nervous if I don't keep a little snack on me.
First it was sushi, now Ahiatsu massage, what's next?!
Do you want it over easy?
Just when you thought it was safe to go onto the sand bar...
Mom told me about parasites,  but this is rediculous.
Noticed squirrels store acorns.
Yeah,now he's got my back,but later I get his.
I don’t know what he’s doing but he’s been up there for hours.
This is not what I had in mind for a "movable feast''!
I just ate. I'm saving him for later.
In my other life I was a surfboard.
It's for an instagram post. When he stops filming I'm going to eat him.
Who does he think I am, Uber?
I agree... Ever since Aquaman went vegan, he's been acting like such a wimp.
That's not what I meant when I said get a backbone, Bob.
Look what we have to constantly put up with.  And if I bite the kid, all of shark nation will be accused of inappropriate aggression.
David Fleischer, New York, NY
It’s Jimmy Buffet, you imbecile!
MSGA - Make Sharks Great Again!
They really need to re-release Jaws on the big screen.
Can you imagine how many likes I'd get?
They taste better when they're healthy.
He’s not as irritating as a ramora, and getting into The Hamptons is a snap.
Nah, they’re too bony.
He's from Finland
Sometimes I can really identify with Rodney Dangerfield.  No respect.
Yes, Uber has hit the open seas. I figured I'd try it for a while as I'm always just cruising around anyway.
He’s part of my new balanced diet.
It's Damien Hirst. Do you know anything about Formaldehyde?
Why, it's ashiatsu massage, of course!
He said if I hold him up he can tell me what the weather's like.
She got the house and half of everything I have.
He says he's a remora.
Going vegan is a delicate balancing act.
At least I have something to sink my teeth into!
I'm waiting for just the right moment
Nothing beats a neck massage before dinner.
Not yet, I’m waiting till he turns 18.
I can't hurt him until he sees that he's in danger. You know, like in the old cartoons. Trust me, it'll be hilarious when he finally looks down here and I can eat him.
Dinner cruise ...
I don't know how much longer I can wait here until I have lunch.
It actually relieves my back pain.
I thought I’d better bring my own lunch today.
Aquaman forgot where he parked again.
Vegetarian Shark Week sucks.
Did you wait 30 minutes before swimming first?
He can’t swim; plus he paid me lots of money to promise not to tell anyone.
He's my fish finder.
It's much more fun once you go vegan!
Was it tasty?" 
"Not half.
I'm just here to support people.
I ate the top part.
A little bit higher.... ahhhh!
Yea, He's a stand-up guy.
Evidently, he hasn't seen JAWS!
Because he's managing partner, that's why.
I'm trying out for Aqua-Uber, so don't even think about it!
I'd eat him but he really helps me back!
No,I'm a bait white shark.
My humiliation is complete.
Does this make me into a nurse shark.
He's sooo lucky I've become a vegan.
When they think you’re a reef it takes all the fun out of it.
Oh my God I felt something!
I chose a massage over dinner
It's Mark Cuban, and he's the star of the show
What can I say? I owed him a favor.
I feel bad that I ate his surfboard.
I keep telling him,
It’s JUMP the shark.
I know you told me not to play with my food but it's just too much fun.
Hang ten? Watch this.
This sharkboarding is exhausting!
We are waiting for the big wave.
Yeah, they call it "sharkboarding", can you imagine?
I want to give true homage to John Donne and the 'No man is an island' meme, but I'm conflicted because I haven't had lunch yet.
...But dude! You should have seen us in the barrel!
You're going to need a bigger back.
Ron, get it off
I  know but it's too early for lunch.
Uber is testing some new services. I prefer passengers over this food delivery though.
He promised to let me eat him when he is done with the water polo game.  Care for a limb?
He gets internship credit at law school. I get free chum.
I'm practicing willpower for my summer body.
For fifty bucks, you can ride a shark.
For another fifty, you can be eaten by a shark.
Ya I can play rough. But a little footsie is nice too.
I’ve had a wicked headache for the last hour! Maybe I’m just hungry. Anything around here to eat?”
These humans are literally giving me a headache!
I asked him to scratch my back.
Ever get tired of carry-out?
I didn't read the fine print in that Contract with Kevin O'Leary.
It's only fair.  I ate his surfboard.
Ugh, his feet are freezing.
...it pays well
Doug, you need to stop letting people walk all over you.
I'm trying to ignore it. If I bite it, they cull at least 200 of us.
Wait until this kink in my neck gets worked out.
He found out it's Shark International Vegetarian Week
Yeah, I know the money isn't great, but at least working for Uber I get to set my own hours.
Honestly, he's done wonders for my back
its only  temporary . he  just  broke  up  with  his girl._he'll be  gone  by Tuesday!
Don't blame me.  It started as a pimple on my back.
He said he was hiding from a lone shark.
Screw the friendly fish campaign. I wanna eat this guy.
Doing Uber is ok, but you need a phone that works underwater.
I don't have a fork.
Yeah, it's my side-hustle.  They call it "Shoga."
It's just until he gets his swimming legs.
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted a human for my birthday.
Global warming!!!
Marge said I needed to take my lunch to go.
What can I do?  It was this or become a pair of loafers.
Personally I prefer the breast.
He promised his kids if he can find them
Watch out, I’m running late for Ubersea
You seen this guys wife?
I can't, as much as I'd like to. He said he's a PETA agent and needed a Lyft.
I find it more effective than octopus's aquapuncture cupping.
I like mine half baked
I don't know how it happened but I can't stay still any longer.
Whatever you do, don’t start your shift on an empty stomach.
The surf gouging always takes them by surprise.
Top half was chewy.
I like your hat.
They call me Uber shark
They say opposites attract.
He’s on loan.
I think this species is learning to adapt...
Not sure this ride sharing business is really worth it!
I know our relationship is unhealthy, but it's nice to feel needed.
‘Have you seen my dinner?’
I'm just waiting for that scary Jaws music.
But I need this job to make fins meet.
I just feel like maybe this politically correct thing is getting a little out of hand.
It's all fake news ... the dumb lawyer jokes and the smart ass
dolphins. I'm doing this so they'll leave us and our fins alone.
You can't say I never bring you a tasty dinner
Hey, wanna join the finitching school?
It's this new thing called Uber.
I’m beginning to think our new vegan diet is overrated.
What’s the score?
Yes, fine, but what I asked you is, "Do I have something in my teeth?"
To bite or not to bit , that is the question?
I'm supposed to swallow him in the next scene but, to be honest, I don't have the stomach for it.
On the surface, it can be fairly unnoticeable, ...
He smells of pizza. I can’t handle Italian anymore!
Just my luck, another lawyer.
I'm not doing anything until I hear that  Double Bassoon
I don't like this. It seems TOO easy.
That was some party last night.
I’m a cuck.
I'm trying symbiosis this year.
They're texting.
It's a "take home" dinner.
I wouldn’t want to be in Chief Brody’s shoes, it’s the Kintner boy.
Rock-paper-scissors?
I don’t think he knows, but the massage feels great!
Just trying to keep his head above water.
Well, it looks like they need to re-release Jaws for a new generation.
Cuban's giving him a thrashing up there.
My dad thinks it’s hilarious when he puts food on my head.
No, I'm not going to eat him. I swim for Uber now.
Now for his killer dismount.
He's outside of my HMO,  but what he does for dorsal pain is worth it's weight in seal.
Ooh!  He has pointy toes!
Do I look like a dolphin to you?
Sharks love Uber Eats
He's standing on the shoulders of Greatness."
This is my camo hat— I wear it and people think it’s okay to swim out here. When somebody gets close enough, WAM, I read them my list of ways I would improve the last season of Game of Thrones by adding light elements of steampunk.
He thinks I'm his surf-board. You've had this problem before, what did you do?
Pithy witticism.
I'm with Uber Eats.
Every now and then I like takeout...
Extreme sports just aren’t what they used to be....
Well I win with the last man standing!
We made a deal.
If you know a better way to get these kinks out, I'd like to hear it.
You have to build their trust before consuming their life.
All he said was "SUP." Care to join me?
He's got chicken legs. I'll wait for the next one.
We just can't eat them all, can we?
He calls it body surfing, but when he falls off I call it lunch.
Leave him alone.  I need a good back rub

Sidney Delson
East Hampton, NY
I'm trying to go vegan.
And I thought it was embarrasing when they were wearing crocs...
I'll flip you for it.
I’m hoping to attract one with a bit more meat on it.
Well... Hot yoga seemed too invasive
Don't touch him, he's Swedish.
One of us. He's a loan shark.
sooo not impressed with the swimming with humans at the resort, it's not the life changer I was expecting.
Its Not pot luck?
He's too dumb to eat, probably be bitter.
What a day for my remora to take the day off.
It's called professional courtesy, that's  Jeopardy champ James Holzhauer
If I do not get a good massage, I just eat him.
His profile said that he was a shark in the boardroom.
He's trying to start a new sport called shark-surfing.  Let's just say the jury's still out.
He scratches my back...or I eat his
I would, but it actually feels kinda nice
Isn't he supposed to jump the shark?
HEADS UP !
He thinks he's the scorpion...
Do you want to tell; or should I?
Fuggedaboutit, I saw him first.
Quick, he thinks it's a sand bar.
He thinks I’m giving him a ride home...
It was your turn to swim the human.
I work for Scuber on the side.
Is this what they call "Surf and Turf"?
Hon, do you mind having leftovers tonight?
They were out of to-go containers.
I know you think I am spineless
Who's not in the mood for some beach park skin soup?
What?! He had a great muffin top!
Do you think it bites?
I read that carrying the weight of an average human during my swim helps weight loss, but I can't resist eating those toes.
He's great bait.
On a magic shark-pet ride
Does this mean we've been domesticated?
They really are unappetizing
You can have the rest. I lost my appetite when I got to the shorts.
...and then I just swim away, the '"sandbar" collapses, and you lunge!
He’s way more alarming to swimmers than my dorsal fin.
Maybe we should at least wait until his insurance kicks in?
When the wife feels it ok to come in, we eat them both
keeping him around for a midnight snack....
What?! Everybody's wearing one!
Get him off my back!



I brought you lunch
This one is playing hard to get.
Now I know how equestrian horses feel.
Do I turn him over? Or gobble him up half baked?
The idiot, I told him to walk on water, not on me!
Some guys will do anything to look a little taller.
It’s portion control...I’ll eat the other half later.
Don't let your food play with you.
He didn't jump high enough.
It doesn't seem fair, wouldn't you say?
You ordered UberEats?
He said he was the world’s greatest deal maker so I said, ‘Heads or tails?’
I prefer working with live bait
If you can't eat em, join them!
I told you that if you fed them they
I don't know WHATS come over me lately!
Oh, it's some kind of proverb, I'm sure.
My agent told me if I took a surfboard gig I'd be able to grab bigger parts.
I feel so used.
You hungry? I've got dinner on my mind.
I’m his lawyer.
Sure they taste great, but this guy gives a fantastic back rub
Don’t ask me!
Best back rub I ever had.
Meal prepping has changed my life
I'm beginning to think I'm not cut out for Cirque du Soleil after all.
He just thinks he hasn't gone off the deep end.
Counterintuitive, I know. But it stabilizes me and lets me go faster.
Haven't you heard? Delayed gratification, man! It's the bomb.
Uber has expanded.
Honestly it's called a massage
Hors d’oeuvres are on me!
I don’t think so, but if it is Aquaman, I don’t want any trouble!
I had a stint at SeaWorld.
You suppose he'll yell "Hang five!" when I get through with him?
I’m helping him save gas.
It may be my fin, but it's gonna be his fin-ish.
He called it a sharkskin suit.
You can have him if you want...not enough meat on the bones for me.
Just like an arrogant white guy -- can't stand on his own without the underclass.
We get no respect since that damn song hit YouTube.
Look at me:
I have a periscope and you don't; 
so there!
We have this deal.  He shows his friends he can walk on water, and then he carries me over to the kiddie pool.
I heard they pay the other lifeguards $20 an hour
The world used to be on the back of a tortoise.
He said he would get me on Bay Watch
I am really making good money as an Uber driver.
It’s kinda scary. In a very deep voice, this guy keeps saying “dum dum dum dum.”
He's a member of the Remora Union.
This would have to happen just when I start my diet.
Can you get this guy off my back?
This lure was a stupid idea.
I tried to tell him I'm a shark, not a skate.
I heard you prefer the thighs.
I feel like I've lost some respect since I became a vegetarian.
Synchronized Standing Competition
If it digs in its toenails one more time I’m going to eat it.
Apparently it’s called “extreme” surfing
I'd skip it. It tastes like chicken.
Speilberg cut this scene just before release!
He thinks he's Moses.
I'm brining him before I eat him.
Tourists pay better than scientists.
Hummm... The water is more shallow than I thought.
I get him fish, he gets me poachers.
Well, this is a new one on me!
I’m trying a new thing where I eat half and save half for later.
I'm volunteering with Dins On Fins.
This Uber surfing gig will pay for my trip to South Carolina this winter.
He grew tired of bucking broncos.
he said i could eat his brother if I gave him a ride
I always come here in July for spine therapy
What bothers me is that he thinks I'm a segway.
I'll flip you  ...er, him... to see who gets the top half.
I can't make out what he wants me to do. Submerge and he'll drown. Surface float and he'll get sunburned.
God, this neighborhood has become so gentrified.
Yeah, I'm worried that he's gonna be COMPLETELY tasteless - just look at those boring shorts!
I miss stand-up paddleboarding.
If I keep this up Netflix will make a documentary about me
He is supposed to be yelling, "Come on in!"
I don't know,I'm just not hungry.
Fins don't cut it anymore, but social anxiety still keeps people far away
Please don't tell me I've got a monkey on my back!
Want to make a wish?
It’s a collectable decoy.
I had half for lunch, and I'm saving the rest for dinner.
Sure, Bob, I’ve had a spate of good luck - that doesn’t make it cheating.
He doesn't like swimming so I'm his Uber-shark.
Trust me, it's weirder for me than it is for you.
Yeah, but this one claims he knows the casting director for the Jaws remake.
I guess another one got his better half.
Ok, so it's not goat yoga.
Paying passengers help pay the dental bills.
I'd been warned about picking up parasites in these waters.
Now I understand.
I invested in his business on Shark Tank last night
Back off, I've been carrying this appetizer for 10 minutes.
I have no idea where I'm going to install the Uber sign.
Ecotourism pays the gills.
He has no clue he is standing on sharkey ground.
Before we take him for dinner, let him give you a Shiatzu
It's the latest in gadgetry. A human periscope.
Leap, and the net will appear.
This guy is so stupid, I could eat him standing on my head
The top was a little too rare for my taste.
I just want them scared, and I read humans kill more humans than we do..
You order Door Dash?
I  guess  the  swimmer  was   not  as  fast  as
I   thought!"
I asked for Swedish not Thai
I myself prefer the tail!
You actually have to admire his balance.
Dude, this massage is dooope.
Careful, these waters are leg-infested.
It’s more than embarrassing. It’s sole crushing.
Will you be paying with cash or credit?
Order's up.
The fin was getting me the wrong kind of attention.
We’re gonna’ need smaller people.
I feed him minnows;  he keeps an eye out for shark fishermen.
Because being his maritime support animal pays in chum, chum.
I know what you’re thinking.
Can you believe I paid 100$ for this?
Can you imagine the expression on his face when he looks down and sees me?
Could be better than chicken fingers!
And this was all she left me....
Hammerhead? Pashaw!                                                                                                I've got an entire card-carrying union carpenter!
This is not a midlife crisis, it's a lifestyle.
I'm hoping this patch will help me quit the habit.
It’s just in case I feel like a snack.
I,ve got gas.
Technically it's cartilage
You've heard of goat yoga?  Well, this is as close as I could get.
Get it off! Get it off! It's so disgusting...any moment it's gonna drop plastic trash on me.
It repels the remoras.
It’s my lunch, I’ll eat it at noon.
I know, right?  Fear-induced immobility was supposed to be our thing.
Listen...I’ve been getting cold feet...”
I just can’t wrap my head around this!
I’m trying that new service “Food to Go” !
It's the Surf 'n' Turf special.
What’s your problem? I was feeling magnanimous.
That explains it. I was wondering where the other half had gotten to.
I mean, standing on water won't make them think too much of him, right?
I'm just pulling his leg.
Millennials.
I know, I know. But the price was surging, I had to take the fare.
I thought our PR could use a boost.
If this idiot doesn’t get off me soon, his nickname will soon be “stumpy.”
I'm depressed
Next time, let me know when you're coming for dinner
The moron thinks he's standing on the bottom.
It makes me more aquadynamic.
These mandatory lunch breaks are killing me.
Just another example of 'the man' keepin' us down
It’s supposed to help with the cravings.
Yep, well, many a truth is told in jest.
No thanks, you go ahead. I’ll be eating in tonight.
I knew those shark tracking apps would lead to no good!
Grubhub.
What are you doing after dinner?
I'm not sure why I keep him. He does like sardines, though.
He pays me scale.
Have you ever lost your appetite for no good reason?
So much for biomimicry, he knows there is nothing like the real thing.
This court dismisses pulling a rabbit out of a hat as evidence
You want to be the one to break the news, or should I?
And then they wonder why.
Another “Shark Tank” loser!
It's called ashiatsu massage and all the sharks are doing it.
I felt bad for the kid, Jerry. Prom weekend and he couldn't afford a limo.
The millennials needed a new trend after self-driving cars.
Like to come to dunner tonight?
I know, I know....
Bruce, remember: humans are friends, not food.
It's mutualism.
I don't think this guy's keto diet is working out too well.
Wait. I thought you said "Beto" diet.
You ever tried bait?
Picked up surfing as a hobby, but it's more of a headache than you realize
Third time this month I've been mistaken for a surfboard.
It must be tourist season again...
I was told around here it’s not illegal to use live bait
Good morning. Old chum.
service with a smile
He's MY lunch...he just doesn't know it yet...first, I have to work up an appetite first by treading water in place for 10 minutes while he plays to the crowd on the beach.
Sorry but I don't like raw fishermen...
My therapist says this is good for me.
We wait till they Q the music.
Can you tell I already ate the top half?
I feel so violated.
I thought it was just a headache.
He thinks he's on a reef.
First I braise them
He promised me a job.
He thinks he's playing Jump the Shark. I hope he tastes better than the last one.
I save the drumsticks till last.
Skinny is still tasty.
I regret taking my food to go
I have your order for delivery...
This economy, am I right?
This time, forget about the deep-fried wings and keep it simple. The left leg is yours and the right is mine.
Even the tourists found out Martha's got me on the kelp. I've been giving dorsal fin rides like I'm some kind of dolphin, all month.
I always like to bring a snack along.
What can he be thinking?
His hepatitis screen is pending.
This chum is getting too chummy.
I don't know, Bob...I fear that I've lost my edge.
You ever have one of these?
I thought I was tough but lately, I've been letting people walk all over me
They're the only parts I'm really interested in.
I'm starting to think it's political.
Would you believe, this is harder than it looks!
Three is a crowd.
I got community service for eating his surfboard.
He really gives a great foot massage.
Last week I mistook his surf board for meal. I guess now it's his turn.
I signed up for "Swimming With the Humans" but I think he signed up for something too.
I saved the drumsticks for you.
Sometimes it's not easy to keep my food fresh.
You know we can't stop to chat.  My Uber rating is already down to a 4.7.  Also, I'm pretty sure we'd die.
Listen doc I just want this *thing* off my *back*
This one tips in sardines
Oh that's John, he thinks he's a remora.
Me neither. I don't understand fashion at all.
The orcas have given up. It's our time to shine!
I'm going back to remoras as soon as his contract is up.
I took it home because waist not want not.
It mostly helps with spine alignment.
I told you to pack your own lunch
It's like he's baiting me into acting like a shark.
I'm baiting him for a larger one.
Apparently, more environmentally friendly than speed boats
I happen to like the mixture of wet and dry meat.
Well you know what they say, “If you can’t eat ‘em adjoin ‘em”.
It’s all the rage....he’s a chum
What, never seen a shark getting a foot massage?
I can’t decide whether to eat him or just enjoy the massage.
When he falls off, I'll gobble him up.
My wife said it was pot luck.
I think this stand up paddleboard craze has gone too far, don't you agree?

It's hard to get a day's work done with a monkey on your back.
He wants us to help demonstrate his new shark repellant on Shark Tank.
Diets suck.
I thought global sea level rise would be a good thing.
Dark meat is juicer.
He told me this would be good for my root chakra, but I think I'd rather just eat him.
He is lucky I don’t like the taste of humans.
Let's talk about table manners, The lower part in water is mine and the upper one is yours!
It was a bad itch.
We have a working relationship.  He rubs my back.  I clean his feet.
Foot massage before dinner.
I miss when they'd just jump us for attention.
Yeh, I know it looks weird.  But he asked nicely and, you know, I couldn't say no.  Anyway, if he is going to be some sort of Grand Poobah he will have to learn how to swim with us.
I/m saving him for lunch.
Moonlighting for Uber. Why do you ask?
God I wish I was a piranha!
just helping change the bad PR from Jaws #6.
I can't get rid of this monkey.
Do you want to take this one?
There I was couch-surfing...now I can't get rid of him!
Would you mind doing me a little favor?
The least he could do is cut his toenails.
It's Uber's new service...finsharing.
First it was just incessant singing, now a movie adaptation? I don’t know, Mama Shark... what should we doot-do-do-doot-doot-do-do-do...?
Please say you will stay for dinner.
NO!! You cannot have lunch with him after he finishes my back massage!
He told me that since I prefer dark meat, he needed to get some sun!
We can do lunch after my back massage
At times, I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders....
Improves the freshness and gets the blood pumping.

I like a good foot massage before dinner.
We can't keep meeting like this. I just can't do it to Stan - he's in such a vulnerable place right now.

Filling in until a replacement is found... had it BEEN a seal, I wouldn’t be in this predicament!
I lost a BAD bet damn it!!
Get this guy off my back please.
I figure if he can strengthen his core like this, he'll eventually taste a lot better.

I'm saving it for a snack later!
I'm just not feeling respected
Now I understand what living at Sea World feels like
Ever Since I signed on with Uber, I've gotten all these strange requests...Do you have any idea where "Times Square" is?
Let's do lunch—the treat's on me!
It's sort of like Custers stand.
Uber in Florida in 2050.
I'm really sorry but he makes my tail wiggle.
I'm only doing it until he gets his "shore legs" back.
He needs to learn how to be a five-star passenger.
Are you here to replace me?
Are you ready for lunch?  This guy doesn't understand that even at Sea World, we have our limits.
Do you remember, when I told you my new cleaner fish is a bit different?
Wait! Look at the surprise on his face.
This overcrowding has got to stop.
Terry swears they’re more tender when they don’t see it coming.
The wife's busy. She told me to pick up delivery on the way home.
Hey man, watch this trick.
It’s the new “functional fitness” trend
Little help?
The lengths I have to go to get a good Ashiatsu massage!
This new ride-sharing job really helps put food on my table.
300 hours of court ordered community service.
He thinks I'm a rock. A rock! Judy, do I look like a rock to you?
Being in the gig economy sure beats chasing fish all day.
Since becoming a vegetarian I've been making a living as a surf board.
Flip a doubloon?
You’ve got to be careful. They often mistake us for surfboards.
Sure, it's just like those other ride-share services, but in addition to earning a few extra bucks I can eat the day's last fare.
I'm bringing dinner to my in-laws'. I figured I'd bring fresh food.
It is important that you  accept  what  the  deer and the antelope played at  on the range!
This new device gives me outside 360 degree vision.
I't's called Human yoga. We used to just eat them.
I’m too committed at this point so, no, I won’t go to dinner with you.
This generation really needs a Jaws remake.
...And to think he took me for a spineless
jellyfish.
There’s no medical, but I get to work my own hours.
Don't look at me like that, it was a good gig for Shamu!
Listen, it's my job to follow orders and the mermaid princess said she wanted human legs.
Did you see the top half anywhere?
I’m elevating my cuisine.
Yeah I guess I'll miss him after I eat him.
Is this enough for dinner?
This ride-sharing gig I signed up for isn’t paying the dividends I expected.
You see, dogs aren't the only ones that can do this trick.
How about a casual lunch?
I prefer breast meet.
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.
I'm working part time for Uber Eats
I sim for uber a
few
Where is John Williams when you need him?
Shark obedience school
I don't like this "gig economy" thing as much as I thought I would.
Lyft was looking for divers and I needed the chub change
Don't you think I would take the legs if I knew how to walk?
I'm waiting patiently for him to jump the shark.
What, the legal intern? Just getting his feet wet.
I’m gonna need a bigger stomach.
I found the legs to unappetizing, but know you'll eat anything!
Hi, I’m your Uber
I know it looks stupid, but working for Under helps me
 put more fish on the table.
I thought I'd try a decoy.
I should have listened when you told me not to sign up for Uber.
Yeah, but he gives me five stars.
I like the whole massage aspect of it, but I'm getting hungry.
These back massages don't last long enough!
I'll never do this Salomon Brothers internship thing again.
The upper portion was yummy
Bothersome ?
Not at all. But if you want him,he is all yours.
I feel like hrs just treading water. Should I just cut him off?
Dinner AND toothpicks.
I’m moonlighting as a water UBER. Ocean times are tougher than ever.
If Shorty appears kiss him.
And this dude calls himself a surfer.
Got any ideas how I break it to him that I'm not a sand bar?


-- D. Parker, San Francisco
What can I say?  it’s a living.
Fetish? I thought you said feetfish.
It's been one of those weeks.
He thinks it’s a cheap ride, but wait until he finds out about surge pricing.
Human yoga.
As fishing lures go... this is the best bobber yet.
He's my snack for later.
What would Beavis and Butthead do?
I'm not convinced about becoming the new luxury inflatable pool toy.
They don't do delivery in my zip code
But mom, I like to play with my food!
Oh, he is so gonna get the shark and awe treatment.
Lunch delivery for Mr. Fin.
It could be worse, I could be soup!
Heads up, this guy is a bit peeved by the transfer delay.
I'm getting tired of this 'professional courtesy' thing -  he's my next meal.
Now I know how it feels to be taken for a ride.
He says its a symbiotic relationship, but I'd have to dive to test that.
You know ice cream sales are up this month
He's looking for a pair of fins. Any interest?
The invitation said “potluck.”
Are you going to tell him or shall I?
My back is itchy
‘It just goes with being a dogfish.’
What? It's surge pricing.
You’re welcome to the top half first.
It’s new business- 
a ride sharing.
It's the latest trend in extreme sports.
Half a loaf is better than none.
This poor loser thinks he’s on dry land.
I prefer to carry my lunch.
Feetish massage.  Yummy.
He's been taking a selfie for the past twenty minutes, can't really move until he does.
Their regular Uber drivers are on strike.
I thought during the closed season I could make some money from this Uber thing, at least.
This helps me get a LOT closer.
He’s light. The pay is good. He might have a friend for you.
They are not a very intelligent species.
I bit off his toes last summer and my conscience got the best of me.  Now I ride him around the bay so he can impress his friends."
Stop playing with your food
He thinks I’m a rabbit
I can’t get this guy off my back!
You’d think we would get at least a third of the money.
Shark or sink.
Looks like daddy shark do do do do is the winner.
Damn millennials and the ‘gram
Once he leaves me five stars you can attack.
Death is not the end.
I'm saving him for tea time.
So,now will you go out with me?
It's easier if you make them feel warm and comfortable first.
Call me Ceremony and I'll bite your face off.
I'm working the gig economy as ab Uber shark
Look it’s a free massage, don’t judge!
I prefer leg of lamb.  You want his?
I owe him a paddle board
No thanks, I brought my own lunch
He doesn't weigh that much.  It's the toenails.
We've thrown in a free second leg with your takeout order
I only do Uber on the weekends.
He's a vegan.  He promised to lure meat eaters out here if I did;t eat him.
Maybe, maybe not not .  .  . I really prefer the taste of board shorts.
He plays a great "Jaws" theme on his tuba.
Enough is enough! If you don't eat him, I will!
No there isn’t.
Grubhub or Doordash??
Overheard at the sandbar; “Cheers, this one’s on me!”
Something's fishy here!
OK, It ain't the reef but here you get all the fish you can eat and water temperature control.
Sure, I get hungry. But this is the only relief I can get for my chronic backache.
I'll flip him. Heads you get um, tails he's mine.
He promised me something bigger.
We could have him for lunch, but then Uber might fire me.
I'd ask you to spell me for awhile, but I'm afraid we're *all* sort of supporting them.
You'd be grumpy too if your food was playing with you.
I like a little ashiatsu before lunch.
If you stay perfectly still, he can't see you and will hopefully swim away.
Like shooting fish in a barrel
He thinks he's standing on the bottom. How do I break the news?
Do you hear music?
He scratches my back and then I eat him.
Long story short: he pulled a thorn out of my paw.
Delivery?
I'll have the rest of him for lunch
It's just not the same when we do it.
Here is your UberEats delivery sir.
75/25 or I’m outta here!
I’d bite him, but I’m trying to be my best self.
Lifeguard interns are much too brazen these days.
It's right behind me, right now, isn't it?
The line for poke bowl was too long so I finessed us some sashimi instead.
Yes, he's THAT Laird Hamilton.
I would bite him, but I’m not a fan of stereotypes.
Trump's white guys can't jump!
What do you mean there is not enough meat on him?"  " You said you wanted to start a low fat diet.
There's a sous-vide frenzy right now
HEAVY meal ahead!"
He's my first Uber passenger.
I got a 50% vig for this one
My girlfriend wanted take-out.
And they say Shark Fin hunting is illegal.
Can you believe it? This guy keeps saying global warming is not a thing... this used to be his living room!
If you keep your fin underwater, I'll split him with you.
The pay is lousy, but it’s the only summer job I could get.
Getting aboard the gig economy
He has a 5 star rating but one more shark joke and he’s fuel .
He doesn’t know about jumping the shark.
I started with goat yoga then moved on to surfer yoga.
I’ll go ahead and have the legs, the breast is always dry.
Uber's not all it's cracked up to be.
I’m just happy that this idiot doesn’t know what happened the last person who thought I was a dolphin
Stay low!  They want our eggs, too.
Without the dangling, it’s just no fun.
Looks like we're gonna need a bigger ocean
Remember when Jaws was scarier than Blackfish?
I broke his surfboard.
Life is moving by pretty fast at my age, I’m just trying to slow down, not stop of course, and smell the roses
It's an alpha male test.
You just wait, its a little trick i learned from them
I’m saving him for tomorrow
Wait till he posts a few selfies.
We bonded at Seaworld.
I lost a bet. For now.
He's a verified rider and I could use the money.
You wanna go get something to eat
Shark yoga. Beats chasing seals for a living.
I now identify as an emotional support Selachimorpha.
It's something like Uber for swimmers. Pretty good pay, but they fire you if you eat a passenger.
No, this is our new food delivery platform that makes getting great food as easy as getting a ride.
Don't eat him. I want to keep my five-star rating.
I've picked up some seasonal work offering cruise ship excursions.
I know this bites, but with rising sea levels, we have to learn to coexist.
It’s heavy, but it’s a find.
Damn...I wish! But we can’t. Remember, we’re doing keto this week!
Thinking that he is still aboard his Stand-up paddleboard?
He says: "When the water recedes they will see I have trunks on, but before that I need to swim with the sharks." Also says I will get 10% commission, do you know what food that is?
Don't you just hate it, when people walk all over you
The best he can do is 24.99% APR.
Time to mingle and get a bite to eat.
Of course this will work!”
He says he's a Finn.
There are advantages to being a sand shark.
No I will not shake!! I might get ticket for contamination!!
Hey Tony...is there something on my back!
Say Finny
Seen anything to eat?
Yes sir, would you like tonight’s hor doevre? We call it “lower half.”
How do you do, fellow shark?
I’ m just working for SCUBER  until I get my degree
I’m not sure this human yoga is worth the effort.
I doubt he's seen Jaws.
It sucks being a pet shark.
Sorry, a couple of  heels held me up.
He's paying me in exposure.
This Uber gig is not good for my back.
Sharfing
Too soon...
I'm Shark Weak
He is really weighing in on our conversation.
They're easy to capture with an adjustable-rate mortgage.
Uber Sharking needs to implement a better dress code
I got the massage and lunch combo.
You know, one day at a time.
Can I get a doggie shark baggie for the bottom half?
I wish he would replace his surfboard so I could taste a new one.
I'm trying to make up for all the bad rap we've gotten since that horrid movie with Richard Dreyfus, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw.
He is directing Shark Week this year.
Jumped the shark?  That's a thing.  Jumped on the shark, not so much.
It's like Uber but in the ocean.
He's taking testing the waters to a new level.
AirBnB. Covers half my mortgage.
Shark Week keeps me downtrodden. I don't get it.
I took a bite out of his surfboard. It was expensive.
Missed. 
Got the surf board
Have you seen him?
I told you the stand-up comics are going to the sharks.
I'd rather have plastic
It doesn't pay much, but every little bit helps.
I  wish he would jump this shark now.
He will give me food if I take him across the Pacific
My experiential concept will be a first on Shark Tank
He promised I could be in his movie.
To make matters worse, his feet smell!
This obviously isn't how I thought things would work out.
You up for a chicken fight? Winner eats all.
I’m allergic to sunblock.  Bon appetit.
He tips well"
You can have him, I just had lunch.
Honestly, it's not what it looks like.
Patricia Lewis, Alliston, ON
I said Eat Him , not Eastham. Besides, he's from Truro!
Does he understand?
It's from the new carry-out place on Washburn.
you mean he isnt a remora?
Do you want the top or bottom half this time?
I know it's an aquarium, but I'm hungry.
My fitness coach says I need to get food off my mind.
I’m getting tired of these lawyers.
What do you think, Marge? I picked it at Jaws's Secret; they had a special on head wear."
How about a game of ping pong?
Sea World scout.
I am a breast man.
Edible?  You bet.
Yeah, say what you want about the company, but I’m making good money with Uber Pool.
I can't seem to get this monkey off my back
It's a quick hundo, so they can tell their friends they know how to water ski.
Beach Informant...
I call dibs.
I think at this point it's too late to ask their name.
You just bribe the skinny ones to lookout for the chubby ones.
He taps his foot twice when
please leave him for me
Is that you dear? Thanks for the foot massage.
Really? You think the bowler worked better?
This guy thinks he called an Uber.
Can you give me a lift?
Are you sure this is an outstanding meal?
I really want to eat him!
Wait knuckling it ‘til my gig’s done at Sea World
I can't eat him, he's going to vote for Trump
It's a new service called Lyft Shark.
I picked him up off Cape Town. He thinks i'm taking him to New York.
We only charge for a one-way ride

If 'Jaws' could make it big, why can't 'Upper Back?'
SMS: Shark Massage Service
Somehow, I'm getting the loveliest back message.

Its a new sensor I am trying out
He still thinks he's in the kitty pool.
He thinks he's on solid ground, but in a minute he won't have a leg to stand on.
They call it 'shurfing.'
Want to try a leg of lamb?
I know, but it beats being an Uber driver.
Ugh, millenials! Am I right?
No thank you, I'm full.  I'm saving this half for dinner.
It's called foot massage.  You really oughta try it.
I know. He's dum, but I'm sort of attached to him
It works great!  They never see you coming.
I hope he's a good tipper.
On the upside, things are looking pretty well
I'm under foot. Can you give me a hand?
All I hear is blah blah blah....
It's a new Uber service. Helps pay the bills.
When I was told that I was going surfing, this was not what I had in mind.
We made a deal--I let him scratch my head, then I get rid of his bunions."
The poor guy couldn't get an Uber.
The koi say it’s big where they’re from, but frankly I’m just not feeling it.
It's part of the re-branding we started after Jaws.
My second cousin was a dolphin.
Jaws” therap

I’m down to bone on bone .
Close your eyes and make a wish.
Surfing is so last year dude. Say hello to sharfing.
My regular masseuse was booked.
I invited him out for dinner.  He said he has to fix his hair.
These mellinial parasites just won't move out.
This th-thing is c-c-cold.
It's the gig economy, stupid!
I told you, it's called the gig economy.
He’ll be fine. I prefer Manhattan Chowder over New England.
With rare exceptions,I skip the fiction.
Beep beep, George. It's peak hours.
He has me on retainer.
I don't wanna let him down!
I already ate the torso. Do you want a leg or not?
But it feels so good.

Why do you think they call us Sand Sharks?
Right or left?
No,you cant keep him
and I thought I was the predator here.
You think I should let him know?
«I think he got away...»
It scares the locals less than the fin.
What say I pull down, you bite, and we split the difference?
Sure it's annoying, but I'll take it over dealing with my kids.
I know, but he needed help keeping his head above water.
The portion was so big that I could only eat half, so I decided to get the rest to go...
The wife told me to bring something home.
Daddy Shark, what should I do-do-do-do-do-do?
Yeah, I'm hungry, but this is just too easy.
Hunting in China it's way too easy...

I'm going to bite his Great White legs off.
I don't know if I can keep doing this until lunch time.
Hey, we're friends. He's just a chum
He paid me a fin to do this.
I get why no one visits Greenwich
Yes, I would...but I’m also ticklish..
Is this what they mean about being a Good Samaritan?

Then he said, “jump the shark!”
That G***** genie.

Wanna split it with me?
I'm waiting for him to hang ten. I love toe jam.
You're the one with the foot fetish, bitch!
Meet Kevin, my new investment banker!
His Mar A Laga reservation includes professional courtesy.

I want to be helpful.  I can't eat him.
Welcome to the Anthropocene.
So I said,"How am I supposed to get my take-out home without a plastic bag?!"

Don't you dare. He's scratching where it itches.
I can’t, I’m full.
I ordered wings!
They have it bad enough up there already
Looks like he still won't let Nancy cut his toenails. It's weird that she wants to but she's so hot I'd bone her in a second with my weird two-pronged shark dick. I'ma calling her right now for some surfer-and-turfer or some shit. She's gonna love it
I don't like the fishy odor, you can have him.
Tails! I won!
Sure, but it'll make the eventual betrayal WAY more shareable.

This is different?
I ate his surfboard, and he said this was only fair.
He's pretty scrawny but I think he'll go well with tilapia.
It's some kind of selfie thing.

These massages just aren't doing anything for my stress anymore.

Here’s how we’re different, Carl..
I would rather have a slow and steady bucket of sardines after every ride.
I'm a service shark and if he doesn't like my service I'll just eat him.

I’m saving that for snack.
This is the closest he gets to owning sharkskin boots.
What did you want me to do, they ran out of doggy bags?!
It's camp

I’m a wildly successful UberEats driver.
Ya, it’s a pain but it pays the rent.

I really miss my Remora Fish.
His Toe nails are Gross!
I assume they've got everything sorted out above the waves, because they sure don't make much sense below them.

The fin doesn't scare them anymore--they think their kids are playing--so I decided to wear half a body. It works every time.

There's an upper half?
When I move, we'll have lunch.
Don't they realize they're swimming in our restaurant?
Don't you dare start singing 'Baby Humans.'
Do something, quick!  His toe nails are killing me!
It hurts me more than it will hurt him.
I’m stuffed, Charlie. Want the other half?
Are you in or out on this deal?
Nope, sorry - there isn't any breast meat here!

I acknowledge that the gig economy has its downsides, Justin.
The unintended consequences of Blackfish....

I thought it wouldn't work out either, but he OWNS climate change!
I have a biting business proposal for a new line of swimwear!
Wanna come over for dinner? There's enough here for both of us.
Swim away, doo doo doo doo doo doo.
I can't seem to get rid of this hangover.
Really? The whole country is underwater, And this is what they’re serving?
I let him survive because he entices much human flesh
It really helps with my upper back pain.
I know it's a bad look, but it does wonders for the sore spot next to my dorsal fin.
I was really looking forward to that back rub after lunch.
Will you cut his toenails?
I feel my head a bit heavier than usual.
If I drop, will you share?
It’s very difficult to be a vegetarian in this world
Want a drumstick and a thigh?
Yeah I'm swimming for Uber full time now.
I’d love to but I’ve had this stiff neck all week
I auditioned for the movies, and this is the role they gave me.
No.  Nobody will see him because I bit him in half.
I ate the top half for lunch but I'm saving the bottom half for later, it's an aphrodisiac."
Sorry, he's MY client
Get off my back
Genius,he thinks he's touching bottom.I'll use him as an appetizer.
He's from Chicago. He thinks I'm a dolphin.
I'm making a killing on this Scuber gig.
Do what you will, but not until my 90 min are up.
You didn’t pack a lunch?
I got the surf.  You get the turf.
I subscribed to that new ride sharing service.
It's a trade off.  I get a shiatsu,he gets to live.
1. When do you think it is a good time to tell him you are not a surfboard?
2. And they thought the unlicensed taxi drivers were dangerous...
3. What do you call a man sitting on a shark? Fred a staire!
They’re always this late — can’t we start eating without them?
You may have his lower half, and I'll finish off the upper.
Crazy, heck!!  I'm making twenty five bucks an hour, pal.
I told him he could say goodbye to his wife and kids.
This is what I hate about Veganuary.
Hurry up and bring the other guys. I am getting tired of holding this food up for the feeding frenzy.
I couldn't swim the sharks, I guess, and that's why I became an Uber driver.
This way they never know they’re gonna be eaten.
It's your turn to remind them we're not dolphins.
The top was outstanding too.
Bowling with sharks:  "Make that spare!"
It sure would be easier if we met at the shallow end of the pool.
OSHA said we present the workplace hazard to him?
Is it me or does my remora smell like feet?
Honey, will you scratch my back?
Sure it's annoying, but worthwhile at supper.
Surf & Turf vacation contest.  Its actually incredibly difficult to win.
He’s a pre-lunch periscope”
I’m not getting it, I’m sorry.
Shark to shark - "you've taken this sobriety this a bit too far!"
Remember how we were before SeaWorld?
I don’t care what you say. His name is Remora and I love him.
Why would I eat him before the massage is finished?
I hear he comes from a long line of rodeo performers .
He must think I'm stuffed.
He's last name is RAMORA
We don't want to evolve into surf boards
He's gonna swim with the fishes for this!
Don't judge, YOLO dude, it's on my bucket list
I'm just waiting until happy hour is over for the main course.
It feels like we’re about 2 feet from the surface.
I already ate dinner..
You want his left foot or right foot?
The A train was broken and Jets were at another rumble, so I took a Shark
I just can’t seem to shake this thing.
I had a late lunch.
He doesn’t know how to swim. He’s really nice but he doesn’t really get me. If I tell him it’s over, he’s going to be so crushed.
He thinks it's a cool trick - I call it a snack
Don't bite, he promised another Sharknado
The hardest part is using the rideshare app underwater.
Really? That's jumping the shark?
Yes, I know... it's a test  to see if strict vegetarianism still helps you feel lighter!
Your turn to jump the shark!
So where is your dinner?*
It's a franchise. If you can eat it, you can wear it.
I just cannot seem to shake this pain in my neck.
He’s joining our Law firm.
We're training for a new show called Shark du Soleil.
Professional courtesy.  He's the guy got Doris and me that condo for half price last year.
He wanted to wave ‘goodbye’ to his family.
When he proposed, 'Shark Tank,' this is not what I thought he meant!
This Thai massage is making me hungry!
He said that if I helped him with his beach side theatre installation, he’d get his dad to grant me poaching immunity
So that's how it feels to be a surfboard.
I’ll flip you
I won’t be a stereotype.
The remoras I'd been working with died because of all the plastic and shit in the water, so now I've got this intern fresh out of Oberlin. I can only catch like 50 percent of what he says, but I get the sense he's a total bitch.
Let's blow this Popsicle® stand
This gig economy is getting ridiculous
Hammertoe, not hammerhead.
Oh, this? No, I'm just in it for the food.
I'm about to teach these humans they can't walk all over us.

It's a job.
Just remember, I prefer them medium rare.
No it’s not a foot massage; he’s too dumb to eat.
For lunch, what's your preference: his fatty butt or his skinny legs?
When I was told I was a cornerstone species, I didn't think that this is what they meant
On the count of three I am going to flip him; see if you can get him in one bite!
He's on loan from another shark who owes me fodder.
Please tell me it's just seaweed.
Yes, it is annoying - but, professional courtesy.
I don't think I look like a surfboard either, but here we are.
He promised me sushi from the snack bar.”
I'm working for Underwater Uber. But meals are included.

I really believe that nothing good should be busy.
You would think living in the zoo has at least some perks.
he's walking around on those... what do you call them? oh right, sharks. get it? like the little mermaid? i should probably keep working on it. the All-Ocean Comedy Contest is still a week away. what's that? sure i'll go into detail about my comedy!
No one really understands until they've experienced this guy's feet doing a deep, deep pre-dorsal massage.
Sooner or later I'll eat him, but for now it's really helping my back pain.
It's just for the week Ed.
When he told me that we should reciprocate 'Shark Week' by instating 'Human Week,' I thought it made sense.
Did you order the one with the pigeon legs?
It's either acting as a surfboard or being hunted to extinction
And I thought "$ 10.00 for an hour of professional ashiatsu massage is actually pretty reasonable".
My mom takes school spirit week very seriously. You should have seen what she made me wear for "Crazy Sock Day."
The price of gas must have gone  up again....
I wish I had a really good reason to ask him to move... like, 'You're blocking my blowhole.'
They say a human foot massage every so often is good for the cartilage.
He's a New Yorker, holds on with a straphanger.
I think this must be à la cartilage.
He should be lucky I’m not hungry
I'm working for Uber. Free snacks, if you catch my drift.
He calls himself Mr Magoo.
Do you know what a remora fish is?
I'm trying to make some extra money doing this rideshare thing.
No, if you bite him in half, I'll have to make two trips.
I told you, I get no respect.
I’ve got a stupid one. What do you suggest?

Don Dechman 
Austin, T
When I become a Gefilte Fish he'll be replaced by a carrot.
Then I'll do a double flip in the air and he'll land on your nose, arms outstretched but steady.
The worst part is that he insists I call him "Danprey."
Waist not...want not...
Remoras are sooooo passé.
I'm hoping this will help me sleep.
The fin just scared them.
He is convinced Mr. Wonderful will be impressed on Shark Tank.
This is the price I have to pay for a decent back rub.
Would you mind helping my passenger off so I can eat him?
Didn't you pack a lunch?
You know I love that humans are less scared of us because all those documentaries, but this is a bit too far
He can't swim!
He's not a pilot fish?
So, I have weak boundaries. Whaddaya gonna do? We’ll eat him next time.
It's carry your lunch to school day!
Scuber driver.
I don't have the heart to tell him that no shark is an island.
My back itches.
I'M going to do a back flip.
Apparently the show hasn't jumped the shark yet.
He's warning Cape Codders to stay out of the water"
Sorry, no walk-ins.  And it’s pronounced ‘Ashiatsu.’

The hubby's birthday gift - exfoliation by natural species.
Now let's see if he can do that with one leg.
I’m with Uber. Are you Lyft?
Don’t go in for the kill until I get to see his expressions.
Don't eat him until I get the tip receipt back from Uber.
The remora were making me itch.
I have an itch.
Whadya mean, standing room only?
Happy Anniversary!
He thinks I'm his surfboard, but that's all part of the plan.
I've been sharking for Uber
The growth started off Fukushima!

It was either this or Chairing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
Jake got the guy's upper half.
It's called "native advertising"

It's better than traditional ashiatsu because it comes with a snack at the end.
It's the latest in lures.
He said, if I don't keep swimming, the relationship will die.
My mom is the harshest disciplinarian in the sea.
The top half was  delicious.You can have the rest.
I picked up some take-out at the beach.

I've been looking all over for a hat like that.
You called Shuber Eats?
I'm going to brutally maim this bastard on top of me....friggen savage

I know, but he says it's a casting interview.
He ain't heavy, he's my brother-in-law.
We're running low on toothpicks. Do you want this one?
baby shark, more like "annoyed shark doo, doo, do, do, do, doo"
He's all yours if I can leave early tomorrow.
Stop.  This is just my side hustle.
I know but I don't like to eat between meals.
I 'm no longer practicing law. I'm trying Uber for a while.
You can have this one, he's not heavy enough for me.
It’s my version of the bite squad.
I'm hoping the resistance training will help my vertical leap.
OK, but I get the top half.
I feel the urge to scratch, but lack the appendages to make it happen.
It's called "shurfing" and I don't like it one bit.
You can eat the bottom half.
He’s just hitching a ride.
I’ve been promoted from a skate board to a skate shark!
I don’t think he realizes Seaworld is just a show

Sssssh. Don't disturb our Dinner. He is drunk
Climate change and the Uber strike provided an opportunity...doo doo doo doo doo doo!
It's not scratchy enough.
Well, why on Earth would you suggest standing desks?

Smelly feet.
"It's like Uber, but for fish
They pay me in sushi so it's a good deal.
It's called 47 Meters Down.  It's a typical summer "shark" movie. Is it degrading? Well yes, but money's been tight, and you have to start somewhere in Hollywood.
Oh yeah? Well, You step on me metaphorically everyday
Right now it's all hearts and minds.
I'll flip him and we can share
It makes my back feel so much better.
I have a case of buyer’s remora.
Wait...wait...OK!
I swear one more time he sings baby shark du doo du I will eat him up.
Underwater UBER, I'm swimming back and forth anyway plus you get fisherman insurance protection.

I know it's not good for me but I just can't shake it.

You see son, this is what happens when "Shark Attacks" go down.
I'm afraid I'm gonna put my foot in my mouth.
do you think I should eat him now, or should I wait for him to fatten up?
He said he is looking for the site of a new movie.
No way! But you can have the wings and breasts.
Wanna come watch the swimmers when the two of us hit the beach?
Do I look like a Carpet Shark to you?
Ahhh, shiatsu massage is my favorite.
Sometimes I regret reading Kant.
You can also tip me in-app.
As a second job, being a Scuber driver is good for the cash but pretty humiliating
Well Jack, Hume In-n-Out only had legs left. They were out of torsos....... Again!
It's kinda like a Lyft gig, I run him over to Martha's Vineyard, hang around the beach for awhile, pick him up at 5:00 and take him back home. The only difference is, I eat him on the way back .
He says that he is just along for the ride.
It’s shark surfin USA.
George and I just have to learn to adjust, that's all.
Doctor Fish, Nurse Shark, a pedicure's a pedicure.
These waters suffer from foot fungus.
They’re less afraid of us since ‘Baby Shark.’

Hey, look at this: They double as a backscratcher!"

It’s the ‘Treading Deep Water Massage’.  You have to try it, really limbers you up for attack.
I was full after eating the breast and wings
I'm saving these bits till last.

He thinks he’s Aquaman and I was full.
He's obviously never read The Gingerbread Man.
Let's hear his pitch before we devour him.
Let's wishbone him Bud!
My school only serves vegan now.
I'm beta testing a new combination rideshare and meal delivery service. It's called Uber Blacktip Eats.
What a terrible weight on my back! Can you bite him please?
I've got to stop being an Uber driver in my spare time...
Something's been weighing on my mind recently ...
My wife is making me try this vegetarian thing...
Would you prefer the top half or the bottom half ?
Now I'm looking for something to top it off.
I’ve always wanted to “hang ten,” but I’ve never been able to resist eating them.
Oprah's giving everyone a piece.  You want a leg or a wing?
His idea is to jump from one of us to the other and back, for the idiots watching through the glass.  Let's drop him.
Can you do it? I don't have the heart to tell him.
Honey, not vegetarian tonight.
What ever you do don’t make any sudden movements
We can eat after the message is done.
I get the middle part.
I was already depressed. Now this idiot's treating me like I'm an underwater uber! Bite me,Georgie. Just bite me!
I dunno, man - sometimes it's just too easy.
And then they wonder why we attach.
Must be Uber Ocean summer surge.
What with Ubereats and Grubhub, I can’t compete.

The doctor said it's just growing pains.
I'm building my social media presence.
Going vegan is really killing my mojo!
I'll bet you a fin I could  throw him off.
I Know ! I know !! 
He is too skinny. I hired him to
find me dinner.
I can't stand humans but they can sure stand me.
Hurry up to the water-sports center, such smorgas-boards are their new thing"
Buzz off -- he's on the lookout for fish.
Shark:" Sorry Jeff! Shark Uber is the latest boat transportation!"
They taste better if a little sun-warmed.
You hungry?
I'm prepping ingredients for tonight's human fin soup.  That's why.
Give me a little time...I'm still digesting the top half!
This and with a monetary donation. I feel we need to support humans with special needs.
Your DoorDash order is here.
I am getting paid by Uber.
Whatever happened to just plain old paddle boarding?
Now that they all have cell phones, the thrill of the hunt is gone.
You should really try going vegan.
It’s my dorsal feet
‘’Just another passing fad…like planking …sigh.”
Uber or Lyft?
This shark-hailing business is killing me.
Man:is this my surf board?!!!
Yeah, it's professional courtesy, basically.
I used to be a hammerhead, now I'm just a hammer toed shark.
What does "Executive Privilege" mean?
Wasn't this part of the pool deeper?
I’m leaving the other half for the gulls.
Always check the fine print on timeshare agreements.
It's Fonzie!
See you in court.  My guy will be above water.
I'd jump through hoops to get back into the viewing tank.
Wait, Joey, you can’t bail on the chicken fight now!!!
Shall I ‘share’ him and his cranial-sacral work, with you?
I am your better half!
Sure, I can eat it at anytime, but the ashiatsu is worth the wait!
Marinating them in salt water helps tenderize the meat.
This new "ride the shark" attraction isn't eco-tourism, it's bull shark.
This ride share business is for the birds.
Well, you know me, he asked for a last request so I just had to.
Your foot fetish is bigger than your stomach, Donald.
He is not worth eating ,he is on prednisone .
I let the last guy "walk on water" first, and then I ate him!
Works better as a line in Rilke's poem.  Actually standing on a fish is slippery and stinky!
Shark Week Uber
Don't look now; there's a monkey on your back.
Would you like your human raw or seared?
It's take away.
I can’t decide between the meal or the delivery guy.
This new Uber pool gig isn't really working out for me.
Tourists- they'll stand on anything they can find.
Can you foot this one? My patience has run fin.
I know, I know, but I promised my wife no more attacks
A candidate for the Darwin Award? 

I shouldn’t have signed up for Uber!
He said just to consider him a harmless parasite and swim around a little while.
I signed up for one of those SharkShare programs. The benefits are terrible but at least I make my own hours.
I know.  After our next America,s got Talent 
Performance I'm gonna eat him.
I really cant believe I've been mistaken for Shamu
And we thought that eating their surfboards would make them go away...
You like drumsticks, so I saved these for you.

Don Smith
Repton, Alabama
The hot stones were nice, but this is just unnecessary.
Who let him into the shark tank.
Where does he think he is? Sea World?
He's doing important research.
I'm starting to drown so i might as well even him
Just earning some extra chum through Uber
This Ashiatsu massage is the only relief after working another episode of "Shark Tank"
Eat him! What an appalling idea! You won't find a better Ashiatsu master for miles!
Bite safety? Talk to Uber. They're the ones taking a bite out of ride-share compensation.
Just doing some pro bono work at the latest sunami
Yea, I know it's bad for our image, but I'm vegan now.
What are you lookin’ at, you never heard of Uber?
How could I say ‘no’ to Mark Cuban?
You've lost your mascot!
He’s with the crew of ‘Shark Week’
They don't get that the plastic isn't the real problem.
I would but skin bones isn’t worth the effort
A snack just in case.
It's this gig economy.
Do you want to know what's more annoying than being attached to a suckerfish?
I like to give back before I take.
Wha-da-ya say we each take a leg and play Wishbone?
ALL VISITORS:
"For the well-being of our marine life, please remove your shoes before entering tank."
Hey, it might look like I'm not a killer anymore but the foot massages this dude gives are the best.  The best, I tell you.
Roadpop...
He's thinking either shoes or a suit.
I felt bad-I chomped his surfboard in half
humans always pretend they can swim
Ashiatsu back walking massage really relieves the tightness in my back. Hard to find a therapist willing to do it in water though.
Actually, my appetite has been a bit off lately...
Oh no! Mr. Wonderful?
I hate it when he digs his toes in.
This Ride-a-Shark business is really cramping my style!
Didn't you get my message...it's BYO lunch this week!
I keep getting supporting roles, like Jaw’s younger goofy brother.
I could of been a contender.
It's like Uber for the ocean.
We can't. He's a corporate lawyer and he's family.
Somebody this stupid can't taste good!
It’s called  “Drown the Shark”
Remoras are just so passé.
I always try to get a massage when I swim to Bangkok
After we do the film...well..."Sharky" might have to get his just desserts...if they try to pay off in jumbo shrimp.
I've been eating the Impossible Surfer and now I've lost the taste for the real thing.
If I dive I want half
I'm up for the next Sharknado movie, that's why!!
I would eat him, but he bribed me not to...
He thinks he is waist deep, wanna see total hysteria, then you can have him, I do owe you one.
Getting their feet wet with their showboating ecotourism is killing my back—not to mention the environment.
....you laugh but its like Hello Fresh for busy on the go sea carnivores, they deliver it right to you.
I know, I know, but I’m trying to improve my image with those guys!
Just between you and me, I think he needs a different boat.
With regular accupressure treatments, I'm able to thrash without back pain.
He thinks I’m rubber
Can't join you, Larry. I work for Uber now.
I've taken up surfing.
He's mine - from here it's just a flip and a gulp.
Get off my fin, doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Sometimes dinner just really weighs me down.
I recommend the thighs.
Surfer beaches are more trouble than they're worth.
He says he’s the apex predator.
I bet the stupid doctor put me on the low fat diet just so he can hog all the good food .
Mako?  No.  Macho.
My rating's at 4.6 stars and it helps with my herniated disc.
I let him live if he agreed to them the water was safe.
Jumped my shark.. :(
Uber Eats with your Italian.
What? I  could only eat a half portion.
He's mine; I found him first!
Dinner or foot massage?
This is the best bait I've ever used!
His other half is in my stomach.
It's a gig economy... things are changing fast. You better keep up.
You  know the old saying, shark eat shark”
No, let's pull his pants down... Then eat him.
With global warming and rising seas, I’ve decided to stay ahead of the curve... I call it SharkLyft!
Why do I always have to carry the heavy load?
Shall we flip for it?
' I gotta new job as a loan shark'
Please help me.  There’s something not fishy about this weight!
I'm working for Lyft now.
Just doing a little bit to help with global climate change problems. He's changing the torch light in the Statue of Liberty.
I believe in a balanced diet and he is surface to requirements.
It's the warm spots that piss me off.
I just can't bring myself to correct him.
I still can't believe we let them bring the gig economy to the ocean...
When they said "Shark Tank" I never expected to be on TV.
Don't go there yet, obviously he thinks he's on a surfboard.
I blame this kind of boldness on Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper
They call it chicken.
I'd much rather be a 'fish out of water' at this point.
What I won't do to make it on Shark Week
-Shark Walk-
“Risking your Shame, by Brene Brown.”
I already ate,but I couldn't stand watching him try to swim.
Do I swallow him whole or only what I can see.
No, your first bite should be his knees.
No idea. He booked me with an app, apparently.
They eliminated the whole 'jumping part' at orientation...
It's your turn!
I hate humans
And I swear I can hear him humming "Mack the Knife."
Don't ask, it's a deal we made.
His trust  has changed me from a predator to
a support shark!
Feet are food, not friends!
I just hope my headache heels soon.
If I wasn’t so full and ate the bottom half, I wouldn’t be in this position.
Just waiting for the other half to fall.
I saw it on the "Jeffersons". It really does feel good.
I'm watching my weight. So I ate half earlier and I'll finish off the rest this evening.
I never eat below the waist.
Guess what we are having for lunch?
I was hungry and  Disney bought my rights for a couple of mackerel.
He sure looks better, than the surfboard I just ate!
Ever have an itch you just can’t scratch?

Tanya Braganti, Marblehead, MA
Hey Ben... new hat?
He promised to let me know if there are any jellyfish around
It's a gig economy out there and he needed a lift!
It’s foot-on-head disease, a precursor to foot-in-mouth disease.
He's much lighter since somebody ate his top.

Working for Lyft has its drawbacks.
I promised his mother I would chew off his ankles for the 1st half hour after he eats.
I can let you have this guy NOW, pay me back 3 on Sunday.
It's easier than goat yoga.
Apparently, they pay extra.
He's been standing on me all day...how long until I can eat him?
Of course I support those Uber drivers,but a guy's got to make a living.
Would you please eat at least one of his legs? I promise to share the rest of him.
Finding someone to give house call massages is harder than you think.
He has a new business model he wants to show us.

His board? I dunno,"cept now I have to take him in
Nah — don’t like the texture and tastes kinda gamey.

How's does my new hat look ?
I already told him he’s out of his head.
Ya oooh yum dessert
Any ideas about how to get rid of back pain?
Well I'm no megalodon and I don't have shoulders, but I think he is seeing further, why?

He was an easy catch.  And at lunchtime, I'll do a backflip and eat.
I guess it beats rolling a rock up a hill.

Let me introduce myself... I am a hammertoe head shark
Offer him 10% participation.
Too many options...
They’re getting so close to shore that I’m terrified to even go in the water.

No more pink mustaches, but I'm still an independent contractor.
One, Two, Three.......
I know our ratings are down, but that jump-the-shark publicity stunt was a desperate measure. And now we have a standing invitation to deal with? Talk about overkill!
I didn't realize it was an Uber Pool so now I've got to go pick up another dude.
Once I get the vest, we can fly, he says.

He got tired of surfboarding.
He's on the lookout for Jaws 4.
He said he'll take me out for shrimp later if I help him just this once.
This standoff is aboveboard.  It's clearly not bait-and-switch.
Sometimes I just don't bother.
It's called a "lure" and yes, it was "as seen on TV".
Its's only fair. You got the first half.
Yeah, I finally became a ScUber driver.

Just give it a week, and there will be enough for everyone.
Uber is gonna have to offer better insurance, because this is getting ridiculous.

Wait... I want to know what happens at the end of this story
He promised if I let him do this for a day he

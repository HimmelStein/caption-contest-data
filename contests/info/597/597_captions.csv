My emotional baggage is more literal than most people's.
My therapist keeps telling me that my baggage from past relationships is what's really weighing me down.
I’ve FINALLY left him.
I guess there's oxygen in the luggage compartment. Why do you ask?
The baggage carousel ride is the high point of their trip.
It was either the suitcase or a middle seat.

I have never left my bag unattended. Why do you ask?

No problem. This is an open-carry state.
Only way we can afford an X-ray.
Don’t judge. We’ve all got baggage.
Oh, I just told him this was a girls' trip and he couldn't come. What did you tell yours?
We met when he fell out of the overhead.
Don't be silly, you can't bring the dog, without having someone to walk him.
I'm told Baggage class is the new Economy.

One is an emotional support animal, the other a financial support one.

It was worse when suitcases didn't have wheels.
And the upside is that the X-ray system has neutered them both!
It's easier to pack them than to pack for them.
It's okay, I have no liquids.
We had no choice. The dog ate John's photo ID.
The luggage screener said Johnny’s tibia has a hairline fracture, but that it should heal on its own. With deductibles going up, it’s great the TSA is helping out.
I had them registered as therapy animals.

This is the first time I've left him alone with the dog.
He's always been excess baggage.
It's actually spacious compared to our apartment in the Village.
It is not so much getting away from it all as it is taking it all somewhere else for a while.
He said this offers more leg room than flying coach

I checked the TSA website for prohibited items in carry-on.
Amazing, your three children and a babysitter! I don’t see a bulge. It’s flat perfectly flat.

I pay a little more in baggage fees but the ticket savings is phenomenal.
So where can you check emotional baggage?

Do you know if emotional baggages cost extra?
'That duty free shop has EVERYTHING!'
JetBlue. Why do you ask?
It was easy--we just added wheels and a handle to our tiny house.

The airlines are now calling first class what used to be economy and calling economy what used to be the overhead bin.
He shouldn’t be surprised, I told him I had serious baggage from my last relationship.
He promised to watch the kids and dog, and he even packed my bag.
It's not a problem. I just line the suitcase with plastic.
They’re always so excited till they realize we’re visiting my parents.
The extra baggage fee is worth the peace and quiet during the flight.
I no longer resent the baggage fee.
Who says what happens in Vegas has to stay there?
If we're paying extra to check a bag, we might as well get out money's worth.

So if you fly first class, you can't even hear them yelling in the storage bay!
With AirbnB, I'm even renting out my luggage.
It was so odd! My husband was completely fine with the idea of a girls' trip to Las Vegas!

Their frequent flyer program needs work, but their carry on policy is excellent.
No, he's not clingy. Why do you ask?
The brochure said "one comfort dog" and the website said "one comfort doug".
As long as they're in a clear plastic bag, it's fine.
I ship the kids.
His mother packed his bag.
Last week I let the cat out of the bag.
They love to ride the luggage carousel.
If you think I'm weird for walking backward while pulling my stupid son and his dog in my bag, then check out the man with the transparent pants getting on the escalator.
I am so looking forward to this trip, Sally. Peter and Daisy were driving me crazy at home.
So I said,"Look, I'm going...you two just carry-on,"
It's ok, they're both service animals.
It was a great vacation. My suitcase is stuffed with souvenirs.
Hopefully they have gate-check, so I don't have to hold up the line stuffing him into the overhead bin.
He's afraid of flying, so I brought his emotional support human.
Actually, the 'checked bag' fee works out well for me.
No, I'm not ready to settle down...who needs that kind of baggage?

You know that bag is too big for carry on, don't you? Who said anything about carry on?
John definitely trusts me, why do you ask?
He seems comfortable with my baggage.
Of course they're considered baggage.
The baggage fee is worth not listening to them whine the whole flight.
It's fine up there unless someone stows a cat.
He's been carrying on for years.
The cat hates travel.
My therapist says I've got too much emotional baggage.
It's the only way to get my husband out of the house.
A seat in coach is $300 but a checked back is only $25.
It'll be heavenly - a week away with no kids, no pets.
They're hoping for an upgrade.
The airline charges less for stowaways than carry-ons.
Oh, you BET I'm gonna check it ...
On the return flight it's me in the bag.
I may have over packed.
It's a new frequent flyer program they call "family and pets."
I don't think he's any more clingy than my last boyfriend. Why do you ask?
They live for the carousel.
Yeah, I expect to get caught. But if I'm not trending on Facebook what's the point of living?
I still can't believe Doug didn't seem to mind that I was going away for a girl's weekend...
I'm hoping the x-ray screening neuters both of them.

How do they manage during the trip? Depends.

We did the math, it was cheaper than the extra baggage fee

In the midst of yet another sexual harassment accusation, Tintin and his faithful companion take desperate measures to escape the U.S. undetected. “For Gods sake, Snowy, GET BACK inside!”
Let me ask you a question, Daphne: do you think the x-ray machine will hurt my dog?
For the extra legroom, it was worth it!
Honestly, this is so much easier for all of us
I'm really looking forward to this weekend away without Jeff.
This trip was my therapist’s idea.
The ventriloquist dummy keeps TSA from going through my underwear.
Once it's checked, no worries.
No he wasn't upset about this trip. He even helped me pack.
He's much less likely to get dragged off this way.
He wasn't pulling his own weight, so I left him.
He decided that it's better than coach.
He's the emotional support toddler for my emotional support dog.
It was either this or the kennel.
Well sure feels good to be getting away without the husband and the dog , just need a break.
It's worth the extra $50.
If I had to say goodbye to them every time I left, I'd never get to go anywhere.
I can’t seem to get rid of my emotional baggage.
I will miss them, of course, but I needed to get away.
We're getting ourselves accustomed to the airline's new micro-economy seats.
Doesn't YOUR husband need any air ?
They are a team. He is a therapy kid.
He forgot our anniversary again.
Guys, zip it.
You know I used to have a minivan.
I don't think turbulence is your biggest worry.
I've got a lot of baggage.
I actually can take him anywhere.
Gee,I think a 25 buck surcharge for a bag is a heck of a good deal
Unfortunately, he doesn't qualify as a companion animal.
We call it "bundling", saves a bundle when we travel. Poke a few air holes in the bag and we're good to go.
His fear of walking is greater than his fear of flying.
He's kind, sweet and funny. And really, really cheap.
They call them stowaway seats.
We don't have a flight to catch. It's just part of our staycation experience.
I've checked. The TSA restrictions say nothing about a man and his best friend.
The TSA is really falling down on the job.
The kids are on another flight
He wanted more leg room.
I told them it was a new type of wheelchair and an assistance animal and they bought it.
And my husband even packed for me!
I knew he was cheap when I married him, but this is over the line.....
After the accident, I really missed their legs, but we've saved so much on airfare, it's almost been worth it.
Well, I have to give it a shot...when I told him to bring his passport, I didn't realize his dog's name was actually Passport.
It was between this and a staycation.
...and this saves us enough money for me to fly first class!
Very romantic that your husband leaves cute notes in your bag when you travel. Mine does too, like “Help!” and “SOS!”
They hate it when I have to check them....
There were only middle seats left.
I love TSA pre-check.
It was either this or a FedEx box.
The best part is the mandatory quarentine.
Yeah, he was miffed when I explained it was a girls only cruise but someone had to take care of the dog.
We had our lawyer read the baggage allowance rules.
It's not the fare; it's the extra leg room.
Zip up; you'll need to conserve heat at 30,000 feet.
You ever feel like your whole life is just some setup to a joke.
You got your husband, both kids, and your dogs into that little thing? I'm impressed!
I just said "fetch", and this is what he brought back.
I can't wait to check my baggage.
I don't worry about the dog getting lost because he has separate tags.
Don't worry, I have "service" vests for BOTH of them.
Where do we drop off our baggage?
It's AirbnBaggage.
He's been baggage ever since we married.
It only works if your husband is less than 24 inches.
He's always been a big lug.
I couldn't check him in, he's too fragile.
It solves their separation anxiety issues.
He ain't heavy, he's my brother.
We decided to carry on with our relationship.
Obviously it saves us money, but he does it for the extra leg room.
Yes, but you don't get bumped from baggage class.
Wheeled luggage changed my life.
I'm stuffing them into the overhead bin and then I'm getting drunk in first class.
I'm hoping to be stopped at customs
It's cheaper if they fly as a carry-on.
And the x-ray showed they are both cavity free!
Thank goodness I left him and the dog at home.
Two years ago they fit in carry-on.
I left my husband at home with the dog. He hates the cost of flying.
I told him I was leaving because he had way too much baggage.
Since they dropped their baggage fees my family travels with me everywhere.
I heard this airline is notorious for luggage delays
Oh just a couple little things at duty free.
I gate check them, that way they get handed back to me in the jetway. So much easier than the overhead.
It was easy. I told him it was over, and that he and his flea-bitten mutt needed to pack it up and move it on out before I left for vacation.
I just have to be careful to say “inflatable items,” not “blow up stuff.”
This way, I know where they are.
Wait until you see the look on the TSA agent's face when I run it through the x-ray!
It's amazing how many things come in travel size these days.
I told him he could come along if he was a good boy...
He stays sober this way.
Yeah ... everything but the kitchen sink.
There's a low bar for becoming a service animal these days.
No, I don't bring a family picture for the hotel room.
They did find my toothpaste.
They don’t charge you for an ‘emotional support’ boyfriend.
Much cheaper, overseas, for neutering.
... and we also get priority boarding.
It's cheaper when you're flexible.
I told him to Keep Calm and Carry On.
It's the new emotional support dog series from Samsonite.
When we get to Hawaii, I'll leave the bag on the carousel for a few days
Hey, we all have baggage...
My new rewards card has no fees on emotional baggage.
Hope they fit in the overhead.
At least I know where they are!
If he fits in the overhead bin,it's okay.
They weren't happy in the checked baggage last time.
yes i packed the dope!
A good thing I had TSA Pre.
friend's fly free
Thank God for airline deregulation.
I probably shouldn't have said they could tag along if they wanted to.
I’m in first class. Bob’s with Rover this time.
It's called Baggage Class. They zip me in at check-in.
I told them I was bringing 2 animals on board.
I wanted to check them in, but then I would have exceeded the weight limit
The dog ate his picture ID
I checked my husband.
'The airline said I could only take one Czech-in bag.'
I know it's risky but I have a suitcase and TWO personal items to put in overhead storage.
I always bring mine here to ride the free carousel.
I'm so glad I dumped him and can live my new life single!
I can't get rid of my emotional baggage.
Yes, I'm hoping for a luggage gate check
I don't know how I ever flew without my emotional support man.
It's OK. They fit in the overhead bin.
I'm sorry. I promise I'll tell him about us when I get back.
Of course, I zip it up before I check it at the gate.
It's cheaper when he travels carry-on.
I just hope he remembers to feed the dog.
They just really enjoy going through the x-ray and being detained by TSA. It’s their thing.
Soon I'll be aboard my favorite airline. They lose lots of luggage.
Everyone wants to sit next to a puppeteer.
Carry on is what you make it!
I pack them last.
He said they needed a little space.
I'm just glad to be free from them and all their baggage for a week.
It's the least I can do to help innocent people affected by Trump's travel ban.
He said it worked at the drive-in movies.
After arguing about who gets the armrest, we came to a compromise.
What's crazy is that I'm a cat person.
Don't know how they'll survive without me, but I need to get away.
When I get there, I only unpack what I need as I need it
I,m sending them to their father.
Umm...the temperature you told me the storage compartment gets down to...how do you convert Cellulitis to Fahrenheit ?
You’re still paying for multiple seats? Amateur move.
Metaphorically speaking, I'm carrying a lot of baggage on this trip.
It will be nice to get a break from the new boyfriend and his puppy.
As the pilot, he gets special handling.
The best thing is seeing their little tails wag when I pick them up after my trip.
I really need to get away for a while.
I hate having to travel on our anniversary. But my husband said he'll have a big surprise waiting for me when I get there.
We met when he fell off the baggage carousel.
Oh them? It makes the flight so much quieter and relaxing for me this way.
I checked Charlie and the twins.
We love the larger overhead bins.
I would take him as my carry-on, but 60% of him is liquid.
That's why they call it carry-on.
Oversized? I wish!
No, my ex. He came with a lot of baggage.
You know, if this was a cartoon, I would not have a caption.
My boyfriend is watching my dog this week.
He’s a therapy kid - they fly for free you know.
Unfortunately, I have a lot of baggage.
The downside is no Frequent Flyer Miles.
It's the only way I can sleep on a plane.
We're embracing the sharing economy by sharing in economy.
What happens in Vegas ...
I love their first bag free policy!
Next vacation will be my idea.
We only had enough frequent flyer miles for one ticket.
I still had to check the babysitter.
It's my philosophy of child-rearing. Keep calm and carry on.
I hope to get rid of the extra baggage during the holiday!
My husband is bringing the twins.
This is how we roll.
It's okay. They're both housebroken.
I don’t know, I feel as though I am never alone!
Holiday flights are so expensive so thank goodness for Luggage Class!
Last year my ex-husband traveled this way but he met another woman in a designer trunk in the baggage claim area.
I can't wait to get this vacation started, even though I do feel a little guilty about leaving the dog and the old man behind.
I got Steven certified as a comfort husband. Now I don't have to board him either.
I can’t wait to show my family the souvenirs I brought back from vacation!
No, I can't. But, there's always one suitcase subjugator who comes to the rescue and crams them into the overhead bin.
They get the adventure, and I get first class!
No husbands, no pets.....this trip is going to be great. I can't wait for you to meet Reynaldo.
They also offer free grooming and unlimited kibble.
Pre-check alone is just OK, but with a miniskirt it's really no-questions-asked.
Like I said, Sarah...there are advantages to being married to a short husband.
Yes, he does have some baggage.
There wasn't enough room in my hand luggage
Yeah, hopefully the next boyfriend won't send me home because I have too much baggage
Jeff's plan to find out what exactly goes on during a women weekend goes horribly wrong at the security checkpoint.
Yeah sure... And where are all of these good men hiding?
The live one keeps him calmer than the plush.
Yes, we miss the frequent flier miles but everyone sleeps better this way.
Hey, I'm not the only one who has baggage.
.... and as long as he doesn't put on weight, I'm saving a fortune!
Since my husband lost fifty pounds, I'm able to take him wherever I go.
I know, it's crazy right, I only left my bag unattended for like a minute.
It's the only way we could afford Hawaii.
I thought having a dog was a chore!
It was either $50 for the bag or $500 for another ticket. What would you do?
If I pay a fee for checked baggage, they get all of my baggage.
He understood completely! He even bought me this bigger suitcase.
The overhead luggage charge is less than the price of a seat.
Best vacation ever coming up: no dog, no boyfriend, just you, my BFF.
I think this is his last trip in the overhead bin
Says he used to hide in the trunk - to get into movies - all the time!
The kennel wouldn't take them, so I have to take them with me.
They wouldn't let me check it.
TSA PreCheck is getting really good at screening my future baggage.
It's only a two-hour flight.
Overweight luggage is just a lot cheaper than a ticket.
...and my Mom said that I wouldn't get anywhere if I married a short man!
Since the wedding, I no longer travel light.
If my bag is overweight I might have to move them to yours.
I just check them at the gate when it’s all hectic.
It's hard to link a guy in a suitcase to a Trump-bashing political statement, Judy, but I'm sure we can find a way.
Does body water count against the 3 fluid ounces in carry-on?
The bag may get lost, but they wouldn't survive on their own anyway.
I'll let the puppy out once we're past security
It's just as cramped, but it's much cheaper.
I swear it would've been cheaper just to buy them a seat.
I finally said yes, but only if the both wore a diaper.
The overhead bin is the only thing that calms them down.
He's used to my baggage...
It's great to get away from the family - isn't it?
My husband and dog bought the new economy flight package.
We're flying United and figured it'd be safer this way.
Even with exorbitant bag fees, it’s cheaper this way.
The dog simply refuses to travel without him!
Y’know it’s kind of a long trip. I like to come prepared.
I'm never looking back.
He's not on the no-fly list, but he is made up of 60% water, so there could be a problem.
My husband is a ventriloquist. I am to take his dummies to Toronto he told me to say.
Why is your husband in the bag?" "Because no animals are allowed on the plane.
If we can get past security, we will save a lot of money.
It was such a weight off my shoulders when Ted left me and took the dog.
Oh sure, I can afford to buy a ticket - but where's the fun in that?
He missed Obamacare and needs an X-ray.
He'll keep the dog warm in the baggage compartment.
Finally... the girls weekend away!
We're no going anywhere. This airport has a special baggage storage area, free for 10 days.
He said the stroller made him feel infantile
He seemed very excited for me to go on this girl's weekend to the Bahamas! Why, he even helped me pack my luggage!
How do you think I paid for those darling Manolo Blaniks?
It beats carrying them on......
It was either this or leaving them in a kennel.
"I ran out of frequent flyer miles".
I tried the cabin last trip, but they kept trying to stick their heads out the window the entire flight.
No drama...he even helped me pack.
Before Trump we had a car and driver.
Told them both we were going for a ride in a flying car.
Sparky keeps me happy when I’m traveling and Billy keeps Sparky happy.
Seriously, this trip's gonna be so good for you. You're going to forget all about him!
Well, anyway, if you compare the fees for overweight luggage with that for an extra seat, it's quite cost effective.
Our insurance doesn't include X-Rays
I had to break up with him. He had too much baggage...
It's so much cheaper, and easier this way too. If they complain, I just zip the bag up.
I always check my emotional baggage.
I don't know, some stranger gave me the bag.
I had to check the kids.
You wouldn't believe how much cheaper it is this way.
I won't miss 'em much...they're always carrying on so
I always get the travel-size so I can take them with me.
I flew them here for $25.
My service dog and my servicing man.
She's a comfort animal. He's saving me $900 for a seat.
We can talk after I check this.
Next week it is my turn to fly for $50.
They had a two-for-one special at the animal shelter.
The tricky bit was getting them past the TSA.
"He's a man-child," they said. "Don't marry him," they said.
The overweight baggage fee is so much easier than keeping track of them.
That customs official and his sniffer dog were very persistent.
They seem to fit fine in older McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and most Boeing planes, but the wheels make it difficult in Airbus's A320.
Registering the entire family as emotional support animals means I’m the only one who pays to fly.
The cargo hold is the best babysitter and dog sitter I've ever had.
Girl's weekends just aren't the same since I got married
Oh, I packed for an entire family.
You never know if you can find one out of town..
Oh, he'll be fine, but he does miss the free peanuts.
I lost their emotional support vests.
He cries for a minute when I put him in the overhead, but it saves me a lot of money on airfare.
I don't mind checking them.
Larry is really vacation cheap. Only downside is going through the X-ray machine but we've already had our kids and Scruffy needs to be neutered.
I'm hurt; John and Rex weren't there to see me off.
It’s the only way I can get him to take a vacation
I love it when they carry on like this.
Emotional support dogs and husbands ride for free.
“I’ll call the minute we get to the Hotel to check on them”.
Sure, they get lost sometimes, but the kids just love the baggage carousel.
I can't believe I can't carry them on. Am I going to highjack a plane with a dog and a small man?
They say a lot of bags look alike. Here's to hoping....
I got him the dog the keep him company on those long flights.
Sure, it puts the bag over the weight limit, but it's still cheaper than paying for a seat.
Even the weight limit doesn't seem to be a burden anymore.
At least checked bags are still free.
Of course they'll be ok. It's just a weekend after all.
This vacation was a great idea! I can finally get away from the kid and that darn dog.
It did take some time convincing them that TSA could mean Take Spouse and Animal.
So then I said it's either me or the dog ....
'Too much baggage,' he said, so I left him!
It’s his nap time. He will be fine.
With ticket prices the way they are during the holidays, paying the overweight bag fee ends up being much more economical.
He was so supportive of this ladies getaway. I think he wanted some alone time.
There’s still a 50-50 chance the airline will lose my bag.
It is so much easier than fighting for overhead space. And I don't have to hear him complain about knee room.
Bill and Fluffy just love the baggage carousel.
She didn't get her child vaccinated? So irresponsible!
Are you sure you added the lost luggage rider?
Now we're going to rise the carousel at Terminal 3. It's his birthday, and I couldn't bear to tell him Coney Island is closed."
TSA is ok as long as he drinks less than 3.4 ounces of coffee.
I can’t wait to see Henry again! I have a special surprise for him...
No, I read the fine print, it falls within the carry on rules.
As it turns out, he doesn't know the meaning of the word "facetious."
I'm starting over, but I'm not "starting over" starting over.
I'm really looking forward to our women's week-end retreat.
I finally managed to sneak away from my family.
I love the airline's affordable baggage class.
You save a bundle just paying for an overweight bag.
My husband’s in luggage.
Some mothers repress their family baggage, but I take mine everywhere.
Not only is it the cheapest way to visit my folks in Phoenix, but we get free X-Rays for Rob and Bella.
You have no idea how hard it is to find a dog sitter during the holidays.
They really force you to fit everything into carry on.
I wonder what kind of mischief Ralphie and Spot are getting into?
The hard part is getting it in the overhead.
Harold's always harping on efficiency, so . . .
Ted said he found someone to watch Timmy and the dog.
I don't have the heart to tell them they won't fit in the overhead bin.
It doesn't just have to be bags that fly free on Southwest...
I check the luggage as "fragile"; much more room to play in cargo hold.
He thinks I have too much baggage.
I just gave in to their whining.
So I told her, "No, we're not interested in gate check, thankyouverymuch."
I can't wait for my parents to see what i'm dragging in now!
How could I resist those puppy dog eyes?
Even with the 'bag fee' we still save a little money!
This way he can keep company with the dog and snooze a bit with more leg room than we have in coach.
They're definitely not doodie free.
Actually, I don't mind the baggage fees.
I just pack the basics. Hotels have everything else.,
My ventriloquist act is booked for six nights in Vegas.
They both qualify as service pets if you fly first class.
The dog's my emotional support and Dave is the dog's.
Thanks it allows us to travel so much more often.
That was actually a white lie - my husband packed it
Now I need to get a roll-away for my emotional baggage.
He is having a hard time accepting that I just can't carry on with the relationship anymore.
"No, I don't mind paying more for the extra baggage".
Never saw the advantages of a 'Man Bag' until now!
It's times like these that downsizing pays off.
My husband is a transportation analyst.
Sometimes his shortcomings are actually charming.
We used to do this at the drive-in all the time.
I could not resist "buy one get one free."
My therapy dog has a therapy child.
I'm flying Spirit!
My ex-husband wanted to come but that would have been too much baggage.
It's wonderful to finally date a man who doesn't bring along all his baggage.
Because they wouldn't fit in the overhead bin.
You're very generous. I keep my dog and husband zipped in.
It's the best super-saver fare we have ever found.
If you marry him, you’ll need a bigger bag.”
He was completely supportive about my taking a weekend away...promised to carry on just as I would and take care of the dog, too.
getting them into the over head bin is also a great workout.
Oh, you know, I pack everything....just in case.
The dog is going with me.....the husband is faking separation anxiety.
We have to grab him a sandwich. They don't serve food in baggage any more.
You'll need a bigger bag if you want a souvenir man and puppy.
I don't have it as easy as those helicopter parents.
Glad it's only us girls this weekend. The boys are just extra baggage.
We met at this great little bistro, but I'm not sure if I have to declare him.
I should have bought luggage locks like you, my family keeps trying to escape.
It's cheaper and roomier.
This will keep them entertained for hours
My ex is a TSA Agent, and this is how he wants his visitations.
As long as those two don't carry on I think we'll get away with it.
Upgrading to Economy Minus lets my dog fly for free.
I'm really looking forward to our girlfriend's weekend. There's so much old baggage from my last relationship that I still need to unpack.
Yeah, its cramped but the LOVE the carousel.
We're flying basic economy, right?
Thanks so much for letting me slip my little Sally into your carry-on.
I love Paul because he doesn't have any baggage.
The overweight baggage fee was cheaper than another seat
Oh the dog shared her travel meds with him.
They'll be fine.
They both have to be Service Certified.
Of course I had to say 'yes' when they asked me if anyone could have interfered with my luggage.
If Fluffy needs a emotional companion to calm her during the trip, it's the least I can do.
It cost only five thousand miles!
Of course, it gets dicey in the overhead rack.
He loves the extra leg room.
You better check it in -still cheaper than tickets
Post GOP tax plan, emigration plan: take advantage of the TSA's 80% failure rate for detection.
Sure I paid the fee. It beat the cost of an extra ticket.
This way I don’t have to pay for the X-ray
There's more legroom than in an economy seat.
Sounds great. I'll swing by the bag drop then meet you at the bar near the gate.
The dog will get a seat, the husband will go to baggage. Saves us a fortune.
The hardest part was shrinking them.
Quite frankly, the only thing I care about is the puppy making it through customs.
They think we are going on a trip but I am actually taking them to the kennel
I'm covered either way - a baby stroller or a service dog carrier.
They're my support animals
Oh don't worry. We do this all the time. With the price of airfare these days, who can afford to go anywhere?
We'd never clear TSA without the dog.
It's on Lucky's bucket list to fly first class.
We’re traveling light this year, no frills.
The worst part is they both bark.
They think I don't know. Secretly I'm hoping this is the time my luggage gets lost far, far away.
It's bitch to get into the overhead bin, but it contains everything I need for an enjoyable vacation.
I decided to check the kids this time.
Regardless of where I go, It feels like home.
I've got all the non-essentials.
Technically It's his weekend.
My suitcase is my home away from home.
With the cost of flights being so high, this was the only way we could get to mom’s for the holidays.
Whoever said 'You can't take it with you.' was wrong.
He had to bring Samson, it's how he rolls.
Steve was very understanding about my trip to the Bahamas.
Well you know these immigration laws are getting tougher all the time!
So what did you pack?" "Oh, you know, just the essentials.
I’ve never learned to leave my troubles at home.
I love the one bag free policy.
If they ask, we're visiting my aunt Susie in Toronto, and we're "driving back" in two weeks. Except don't use the air quotes, obviously.
He didn't tell me how he would get there, though.
He will do anything to not have to fly coach.
When yours learn to talk, they'll ask for air, too.
It's amazing! Billy's separation anxiety has totally vanished!
Codependent? No, I don't think so. Why do you ask?
You Can Check One Bag For Free
Unfortunately they wouldn't take him in checked baggage
I only packed the essentials.
I'd rather pay for the baggage fee than another ticket
I really hope they don't lose my luggage again.
So that’s what they meant by carry-on
Saving money on them allows me to fly first class.
We're testing their 'Friendly Skies' spiel.
This is my first girls’ trip since the marriage.
He gets a seat on the way back, leaving room for gifts
He says there's more legroom than our economy seats.
It's cheaper this way. And I have total control over my baggage.
Robert is Sparky's "service companion" and by the way, don't use the F-L-Y word; they think they're going camping.
They like riding rollercoasters, but Six Flags is too expensive these days.
George is determined not to lose his luggage again.
I paid overweight charges, but it cost less than buying added seats.
I’m just glad he’s over his Tintin obsession.
I may need a little help cramming it into the overhead.
So I said sure; I'll pay the extra $25 for a check-on bag
Oh, I thought it said carrion!
Oh, no, I'm not worried. It's within the 50 lb. limit.
Like I told you in the restaurant, that is NOT what doggie bag means.
He wanted a staycation, so we compromised.
So he sold his ticket to buy more bitcoin, but I couldn't show up to his parent's for the holidays with out him.
I've lost baggage several times, but it eventually finds its way home.
... and Todd's separation anxiety seems to be a thing of the past.
I never know what to answer when they ask if I packed the bag myself.
It just didn't work, he complained that I came with just too much baggage.
He just hates going through security check.
Normally I'd just facetime them every night but I'm out of minutes on my plan.
I check them at the gate
It’s a great feeling to get away and leave our problems behind us!
I have a lot of baggage from my previous marriage.
My husband packed my bag for me.
Why yes, it is one size fits all!
With the price of checked bags, I’m going to get my money’s worth!
I am going to return him as soon as I get back from visiting relatives.
Thank goodness they were under the 50 pound limit so we did not have to pay the extra baggage fee.
I'm sure. I checked the rules about companion animals.
It's always my bag that gets lost, so when life gives you lemons...
Brittany was soon about to realize that restraining orders are void over international waters.
He takes the 'Man's best friend' thing a little too far.
I got them a very cheap one-way fare
It makes the whole service dog thing way more believable.
I guess it'll take a while to lose the feeling of having the family in tow.
Don't mince words, Carol. It's still a road trip.
I love their “one bag flies free” policy!
all I really wanted was some alone time
Sure, it's heavy. But so is our relationship.
Thank you and your boyfriend for watching my suitcase.
I told him we're going to Disneyland. Not my Mothers.
I told him it was a free upgrade.
With the luggage fees being so high, it just makes sense.
It was so nice for your husband to pack for you, I know, he said he had packed away a couple of surprises for me.
With a little squeezing and stomping, I should be able to fit it under the seat in front of me.
He gets the intrepid flyer discount.
I know, they seem excited now but wait until they find out that I didn't fork over the cash for a carry-on.....
They like to have more room.
It's nice when 'family-size' really means 'family-size.'
It's less hassle this way
The bike box fee would have been way more expensive.
I had to get away. I felt like the family was suffocating me.
The puppy already thinks it's on a Disney ride.
I just pay for any overages.
It's just another advantage of downsizing my boyfriend and dog.

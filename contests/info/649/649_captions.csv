I'll tell you one thing - if a train ever does stop here, I'm getting on.
I said, 'Not in my backyard,' and they said, 'Ok, have it your way."
The coroner ruled it a suicide but I'm pretty sure Bob was just on his way to the bathroom.
Just look both ways before you go to the bathroom.
Something's different... is that a new lamp?
If we time it right, I can show you the rest of the house.
That’s not the tea kettle.
His mother refuses to fly.
Yeah, but I no longer need a vibrator.
I could never live by an airport.
Oh, I didn't cost a thing, Mexico is paying for it.
He told me he was an engineer and worked from home; I figured he meant software...
Carol, it is very important that you not be in the hallway between 9:04 and 9:07.
He's in the kitchen with Dinah.
The worst part is having to remind my kids to look both ways when they cross the living room.
- So, it turned out I didn't have tinnitus!
The renovation started with subway tiles in the bath and the theme just kind of got out of hand.
The worst was last week when a cow wandered onto the tracks.  This is all new furniture.
You'll want to finish your coffee by 10:23.
Of course it doesn't go through the bedroom; that'd be ridiculous
It’s a compromise. He loves toy trains and I love being tied up.”
The annoying thing is that nearest stop is two blocks away.
See this is something you might want to mention on your Airbnb.
Bob’s been working on it all the livelong day.
The first blueprints had them going through the bathroom. Can you imagine living like that?
I'll admit that flattening pennies isn't the thrill it once was.
‘$700 a month in Brooklyn did sound too good to be true’
We're still trying to get this straightened out. What we ordered was track lighting!
I just said, 'Alexa, make mass transit more convenient for us'
Eminent domain can be quite complicated, apparently."
In hindsight, we should have let them buy the house
Sure, we could pull up stakes and move out of here, but there are so many ties.
And we hardly hear the neighbors at all.
I should have said yes to the man cave.
On the bright side, I sleep right through Dave’s snoring now.
I'd invite you for dinner but my kitchen is literally a train wreck.
No, don’t be silly. That’s the tea kettle.
I thought it was just a game of Monopoly, but apparently I bought a railroad.
And to add insult to injury, it's an express train that doesn't even stop here.
Don’t go in the kitchen. It’s a trainwreck in there.
If you're ready to eat, we can move to the dining car.
I'll be right back, I'm going to catch the 4:02 to the bathroom.
It all started when we adopted a highway
He’s with Amtrak. On Mondays they let him work from home”
It’s just for fun. Sometimes we do this whole thing where he ties me up and then rescues me.
At first I didn't think that I could afford this house, but I kept saying I think I can, I think I can...
It’s always like Grand Central Station around here.
So, are you here on business, or just passing through?
We're having an open house tomorrow at 10:19AM, 10:49AM, 11:19AM, 11:49AM, 12:19PM and 12:49PM.
So how did you and Thomas meet?
And THAT"S when I learned the meaning of eminent domain.
It seems convenient but it doesn't stop here!
Amtrak recently offered Jim the option to work from home.
I miss living next to the airport.
I should never have said size doesn't matter.
It didn't look that big on the box.
If you want the bathroom, you'll need the uptown train from the kitchen
One minute he's going to the fridge for some chicken and the next I'm a widow.
And the worst part is, it's never on time.
No its not a xylophone, guess again.
..so naturally, when we read that the first place prize was from Amtrak, we thought they meant a trip...
Remember to look both ways before going into the kitchen
The good news is we're close to the subway.  The bad news, it doesn't stop here.
We'll need to wrap up this conversation by 4:14.
Yes, all the livelong day, why do you ask?
I'd show you the kitchen, but a river runs through it.
We’re doing well, but I always feel like something is coming.
We told them 'not in my backyard' and at least they listened
. . . and then great grandpa Cyrus said, “I ain’t selling out to some damn railroad company !”
I order so much from Amazon they put me on their "top of the line" delivery system.
We're happy with our station in life.
On the upside - the vibrating bed is an unexpected thrill.
I'm afraid it's the end of the line for Bob and me.
Yeah, can you believe they accepted our first offer?!
It doesn't even stop here.
And that's when Ralph said I don't know what Eminent Domain means and I don't want to know.
Will you be taking the 4:05 or can you stay for dinner?
It's only someone in the kitchen with Dinah
Everyone thinks it's a light at the end of the tunnel. But really, it's a living room.
Well, we had been ordering so much from Amazon...
I'm just thankful his favorite movie wasn't "A River Runs Through It".
Let me show you my smashed penny collection."
Please remember to look around and gather your belongings before you leave.
Steve should be home at 5:57. Or 6:23.
We think it will be  worth a lot more when they want to turn it into a bike trail
I'm leaving Jim, Marcy. At 12:14.
Amtrak lets him work from home now.
I would show you the rest of the house, but it's a train wreck.
The Mexicans paid for it.
Either the kettle is ready or the 2:20 to Utica is early.
It's our dream home.  Except at 7:04 a.m., 8:04 a.m., 9:04 a.m....
Did you have any trouble getting here?
The only thing that gets laid around here are the tracks.
We were hoping for hardwood under the carpet.
Not the Home Depot I expected.
When the kids get home it’s like Grand Central Station here.
I can't say he's easy to live with, but he's always punctual.
So, I told him, "I know you can; I know you can."
I think I can.
Yes, he bought rope too, why do you ask?
I don’t know where it goes. I always drive.
On the bright side, we can flatten a penny anytime we want."
Unfortunately, the railroad company hired better lawyers.
At first, I was excited when he said we were getting a place on the Eighth Avenue Line.
The lamp is new, thanks for noticing.
The bathroom is two stops down on the left.
I think you'll like Casey. He should be here at 6:02.
Is this one of those situations where you want me to be supportive?
It will make more sense when we can afford the train.
You won't believe it, but it's not as convenient as it seems.
They have plans to tear it up and put in a bike trail.
Henry says we still won since we didn't have to move.
I can stay and talk for another four minutes.
When Howard said he was going to make tracks I thought he just wanted a divorce.
I want to hear all about the kids, and we have about the next seven minutes.
Little boys, little trains. 
Big boys, big trains. Just wave to him as he comes by and he'll toot.
You marry a hobo, you learn to compromise.
It's not the noise that bothers me. It's the people getting off
On the plus side I can’t hear the neighbors incessant yodeling any more.
The noise used to bother me, but then we had the kids.
Honestly, I still end up taking Ubers most of the time.
When he said he was a conductor, I thought orchestras.
The train line has been abandoned, and we're going to turn it into a bike path.
It's like Grand Central around here in the morning.
It's so convenient.  I leave the kitchen at 7:05 and arrive at the living room at 7:06.
It’s 5:14. You may want to hang onto something.
I thought he was saying he was into Coltrane.
He should be home at 6:27.
I thought we were buying a tract house.
He never listens. I told him I wanted track lighting.
Let's catch the 5:02 and I can show you the new kitchen cabinets
Go ahead. You'll make it. That horn isn't as close as it sounds.
When you said your husband was an engineer, I had a different picture.
You know, I think I can!
It hasn't been too bad...except when the cattle cars come through.
Before you go, check around your seat and gather your belongings.
$2.75 to go to the kitchen?? No way. I'll call an Uber.
Long distance relationships aren't normally my thing. But we've found a way to make it work.
Oh.  THAT kind of engineer.
As it turns out, "Let's lay some track" has nothing to do with sex.
But what really bothers me is that it's never on time.
The kitchen is in a better neighborhood
Then Walter said "if we don't sell what can they do about it?"
Really, the only inconvenience is the weekend schedule. Sometimes it takes 2 hours to  get to the bathroom.
The dining car will be here soon.
This is the original Home Depot.
But the box did say "items inside may not be to scale."
What's wrong with you, Midge? Of course there's no train for it. That would be crazy.
I hardly notice Bill's snoring anymore.
I told you we could afford an apartment in Manhattan.
Please consider yourself lucky. My husbands fixation is with submarines.
I didn't know what a railroad flat was until we moved in.
It just brings a sense of anticipation that the carpet runner didn't.
It all started with subway tile.
The Airbnb ad said “easy rail access”
Flattened penny for your thoughts?
You should see his stamp collection.
After awhile you don’t even hear it.
Sometimes that light at the end of the tunnel is the kitchen
Of course it leads to the bedroom. I told you he had a one-track mind!
It's quite an imposition, especially since it doesn't 
stop here.
The alternative was kids.
Someday they'll rip it out and make a bike path.
It’s part of Amtrak’s new work-from-home program.
The hardest thing is teaching the kids not to play on them.
Don't go in the kitchen - it's a train wreck.
The real nightmare is sweeping between the ties.
Alexa, bring me the train.
Walker was totally upfront about being a model railroad enthusiast. I just underestimated "enthusiast."
At first I thought it was an Ikea bed.
If it’s a girl, Acela; if it’s a boy, Thomas
George will be home at 6:49.
He works on it all the live long day.
I like it- Now I don't have to pick him up at the station.
I told the realtor, I have two requirements: cheap, and on the train line.
So there’s a long pause and then the realtor says do you like trains.
The apartment rental ad said, "Close to public transportation."
Oh listen to me.  I've been talking all the live long day!
I know, but at least we’re in Brooklyn.
It's not as bad as his snoring.
Thanks for bringing me a coffee – I missed the 8:05 to the kitchen this morning.
I still don't understand eminent domain.
Switching from cups and saucers to mugs has made a huge difference.
We don't actually use it.  It's a metaphor.
You should see our smashed penny collection.
And still he's late for work.
I’m sorry I’m late, I got off at the wrong stop.
We just redid the place and decided to go with home depot.
It's funny, but when my boyfriend said he was going to lay down some tracks, I thought he was a musician."
After a week or two you don't hear it
Now that I'm telecommuting most days, this move makes less sense.
I say we catch the 12:43 to the kitchen.
The commute has never been easier, but we ARE on our fourth dog.
He’s been working on it all the live long day!
We're just glad it doesn't stop here anymore.
Governor Cuomo says it's going to be up and running in a couple of weeks, so I figure I have a least 10 years of quiet.
It really brings out the subway tile in the kitchen.
Yes, Thomas is doing great. He works from home now.
The downstairs neighbor kept complaining about me walking in heels. So I figured this would show him.
I just got tired of Uber.
Men... Am I right?
It's so much better since they switched from steam.
Don’t worry.  It’s being converted to a bicycle path.
Sam will be home at 6:02, or 7:10.
Happy accident. We thought the realtor said 'tract' home, but we've come to love the convenient commute.
I can't wait for you to meet my husband, Thomas.
The 6:15 to the kitchen stops at the bathroom, or you could just walk.
Actually it’s the ties that bind.
When he said he was an engineer who brings his work home, I expected spreadsheets and charts and a slide rule...
When the listing said, 'steps from the metro,' this isn't what I had in mind.
The dining room is farther than it looks.
The tracks really tie the rooms together.
How long? All the live long day, obviously.
I'll get you a refill from the kitchen after the 1:30.
I don't really even hear it anymore.
He should be home at about 5:38.
Honestly, it's like Grand Central Station around here sometimes.
If you need to use the bathroom, be sure to stop, look, & listen.
It's my fault. I insisted he get a hobby.
Twice a day.  Why do you ask?
Well, we have lost a few pets.
It’s true Helen. All men have a one track mind...leading right to the bedroom.
It's pretty clear Charles and I have reached the end of the line.
It’s getting worse, Marge. He built a canal in the basement and an airstrip on the roof.
If we want to fly we just go upstairs.
With transit, so many people say, 'Not in my backyard.' Not us.
And my parents were so happy I was marrying an engineer.
It's included with Prime.
At first it did, but we've been here ten years, so now I hardly notice it.
And if you need the bathroom, go before 5:05.
It's always the last Christmas decoration to get put away.
Do I need to transfer to get to the bathroom?
...but we still have to change trains in Hoboken.
My fear is the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train.
Sometimes it’s like Grand Central Station around here.
Howard may be arriving late tonight. He's been working all the livelong day.
He calls it his 'what the F-line'...
Did you know that Geico can save you 15% off train insurance?
When you said Tom was an engineer, I assumed you meant civil.
And once we get a crossing installed we'll be able to use the kitchen!
It just seemed to make sense after we got that Costco membership
What elephant?
Dinner will be delayed a bit because of signal problems at Bowling Green. Thank you for your patience.
So the agent says “the payments will be much easier with an easement” and Bob says “that sounds great” and, well, here we are.
Oh, and avoid the bathroom at 7 and 37 past the hour.
We’re trying a different search engine.
Our realtor assured us this property had all of the bells and whistles.
We wanted something to go with the track lighting.
I buy so much from Amazon that it just made sense.
Sorry I’m so late. I had to transfer at the Hendersons’.
We order a lot from Amazon.
I still have to walk ten blocks to the station.
He’s still late.
I feel my life is finally on track.
There are train nuts, and then there's Bob.
The worst part is the hobos.
...and he was so sure their easement was not valid.
He kept repeating "I think I can" and I didn't have the heart to stop him.
Why? Because he knew he could, he knew he could, he knew he could.
So tell me, how is life on the fast track?
I'd get you a cup of coffee, but the kitchen is in a bad neighborhood
I didn't even know what eminent domain meant.
It’s Brooklyn!  You go find a better apartment for under $1500.
We thought we bought a tract home.
Well, I've been working on the railroad. Now I work from home.
You know...., I really think he can.
I can barely hear it over my husband's snoring.
...and oddly enough , my husband still prefers to drive to work!
I'm afraid the 6.15 to the bathroom has been delayed.
I didn't realize what type of conductor he was when I first met him.
It does make it tough for the Roomba.
Once the kids come home from school, it is like Grand Central Station around here
I didn't know the box said 'actual size'.
Easement" just sounded like something that'd make our lives easier.
Am I still yelling?
That’s what I thought too, but unfortunately it’s an express.
It’s like Grand Central station around here.
If it were anything else but a hobby, I’d be concerned.
But we heard they're turning it into a bikepath.
We don't want her to play with dolls.
It's not as convenient now that I work from home.
Let's catch the 7:15 into the dining room.
It goes straight to the bedroom. Men have a one-track mind...
No, that’s just the teakettle.
As for me, I wish we'd never moved to Chattanooga.
It's true what they say, after awhile you don't even hear it anymore.
At first we were very excited to learn we'd be getting a new rapid transit line near us.
I signed up for the latest enhancement to my  AMAZON Prime Account.
Amtrack's answer to Uber.
We thought it was a metaphor, but we were wrong.
You give in and name your first child Lionel and then this happens.
It's New York. You get used to the noise.
Timmy thinks that replica train sets are juvenile and lack authenticity.
I’m just glad there’s no longer an elephant in the room.
He came with a lot of baggage.
It looks like an easy commute, but unfortunately the train doesn't stop here
And yet, he still can't make it home on time.
Why stop with track lighting?” I said
We just thought that we needed a little R&R.
I'm Triple Platinum on Amtrak - they gave me my own siding!
I like that it's so close to public transportation.
It was cute when Jeremy was two and loved Thomas The Tank Engine. But now that he's 30, I think we need to set boundaries.
He never saw it coming.
It started with model trains, but then his eyesight began to go.
On the plus side, the kids are never late for school.
Thomas is staying with us for a few nights
It's no big deal Mom.  You're carrying on like we have the bloody Orient Express in here.
It was a conceptual piece but the woman that was tied to the tracks retired.
Alexa, deliver crumpets.
Being married to Thomas is not without its challenges.
But other than that,we sleep just fine.
Will you need a refill before 4:26?
I thought we’d have a quick drink here first then catch the 6:15 to the dining room.
It’s good to see some money finally being spent on infrastructure.
Oh, don't worry. Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah.
Did I hear what?
How was I to know what size a standard gauge ‘train set’ is?
It's better than Debbie next door. She has Trump's wall through her bedroom.
The only downside is now my parents drop in three times a day
I should be able to offer you a very small packet of peanuts at about 2:47 p.m.
No, we’re actually both very light sleepers.  Why do you ask?
Thomas will be home at 5:07.
Mr. Monopoly already took Baltic Avenue and Park Place so we had to settle for Reading Railroad.
His life is a train wreck waiting to happen.
This is the only way I can afford to live in New York.
I thought he meant it metaphorically.
We just signed up for Amazon Prime Elite.
Well, I did ask the decorator for something that ties the room together.
I don't mean to cut you off, but in five minutes a top-hatted madman is supposed to come by and tie me to my new carpet.
I'm so glad we didn't opt for the 'shotgun' apartment.
After tea, we can take the 1:15 to the dining room for lunch.
It's three seconds door to door
No we're lucky ... it never stops here.
Every night it's the same thing, 'What is this, Grand Central Station?' til I think I'm gonna scream!
I'd show you the kitchen but the 3:20 from Chicago is due any minute.
He told me he was some sort of engineer when we met, but I didn't expect him to bring home his work
Raymond will join us at 2:42.
The listing said 'great for commuters.'
It’s totally fine except a 7:25, 8:10, 9:10, 11:30, 1:35, 3:55, 4:10, 4:20, 4:38, 5:05, 5:25, 6:10, 7:10, 8:10 and 9:26.
The bathroom? Just one stop down the hall.
My mom says that people used to actually WALK from room to room!
I can't say we've had much luck with pets.
Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe should be home from school soon.
Tell me fast; the 2:35 is about to come through.
this place is a gold mine
We can't hang pictures of any kind.
We have until 6:17
I'd love for you to meet my husband... He should be pulling in any minute now.
It fine. Just don’t go to the dining room 4:20, 5:10, 6:05, or 7:10.
Would you like another drink?  The bar car should be coming through shortly.
We thought it was tract housing."
At least the house isn’t next to a highway.
MINIATURE trains weren't enough for Lionel.
Well, I'd love to stay, but I have to catch the 5:15 to Judy's house.
…so I lie down, tie myself to the rails…Geoffrey gallops in and cuts me loose just before…  
It's been fabulous for our sex life.
It's been pretty quiet since the shutdown, so that's a plus.
Pardon me for a second, I have to check the roast and green light the 4:10 through to Tuscaloosa
It was either this or Staten Island.
You'd be surprised how getting tied down and rescued can really improve your sex life.
Yes it can get loud but we love the look of reclaimed wood.
We've got time; I think it's running late.
I’d invite you into the kitchen but unfortunately it’s a train wreck.
It's a conversation starter.  Except when the train goes by.
Frankly I'm not sure there's a right side of the tracks.
The bathroom? Take the 7 line all the way to the final stop.
I am sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Yeah, we bought it because it was close to the train. 
We only found out later that it doesn’t stop here.
It's like people say. The difference between men and boys is the cost of their toys.
I'm sorry Sheryl, I just feel like that table is...out of place.
When I married him I didn't know what kind of engineer he was.
I can't blame him entirely. His profile did say he was an engineer who worked from home.
I'm glad to see you and Thomas are making it work.
When we bought this place they briefly mentioned something about an easement.
Never order a train set online.
Maybe it was unwise to ridicule his model train set.
Dinner should be here at 7:07 pm.
It doesn't go anywhere. I just like the sense of travel.
Then he said : I want you to know, I have a model train hobby".
This railroad really ties the room together.
I thought I was marrying an orchestra conductor.
Our next project is to install track lighting.
Oh , he lives on the other side of the tracks— at least until I get an apology.
Sure it's a little farther out, but we can still get into the city in no time.
Yes, but at least I know Harold will be home at 6:17 every night.
Be careful when you go to the bathroom, it's our crossing guard's day off.
Right up until the day he left he claimed it was just an innocent basement hobby
We love our new carpet, but tracks really show up in it.
Living next to the airport was worse.
The next train to the bathroom is in seven minutes.
What can I say?  He has a cute caboose.
We subscribe to Amazon Prime Delivery - free, two minute shipping!
It’s ok, we’re alone now, at least until 8:02.
It's Arnold's secret fantasy — he likes to tie me to the tracks.
It's down the hall, but I'd wait until the 8:05 goes through.
Oh, you know Jerry and his one-track mind...
It's really not that bad until the circus comes to town
We were told Mr. Rogers was the original owner.
The most annoying part? We live seven miles from the nearest station.
The realtor was right: I don’t even notice it anymore.
On the plus side, it's fun to put pennies on the track.
Once you've lived here long enough you won't even hear it anymore.
Yes, it definitely ties the room together.
Yeah. The worst part- it's an express. I still have walk three blocks to catch the local.
Hold the lamp, here it comes!
Harold will be home at 6:52.
I try never to discourage his hobbies
Next week we get track lighting!
That’s crazy, Linda. That’s all you pay for rent?
And I yelled after him, 'Fine, leave, and stand clear of the closing doors on your way out!'
I should have spoken up when he said he needed room for his ties...
It's much quieter since the Government shut down.
$3.8 billion, and it only runs from here to the dining room!
The 5:15 brings wine,
We like taking the 10:30 to Bed.
With Amazon Rail , you get delivery in 12 hours
On a hot day the breeze is great at 7:01,10:22, 3:11, and 6:47"
At first, I wasn't all aboard.
I really only notice it when the train comes through.
When he said he was making tracks I thought he meant he was leaving.
After the sudden loss of our dear Mr. Whiskers we decided to remove the third rail"
We hardly use the car anymore!
I told you it was like living in Grand Central Station.
If you put an ear on the rail track, you can hear grandma fart in her bedroom.
You're welcome to use the restroom at 2:15, 2:40, or 3:05.
It's called Amazon Super Express Prime.
Well, we had a partial victory in our Eminent Domain case.
When he promised to get our lives back on track, this is not what I thought he meant.
All I said was, "I think you need a hobby, dear."
Oh, you should see his LEGO set.
We moved the couch last week - didn't want our kids hanging out on the wrong side of the tracks.
Well, I do get tired of the trainmen yelling 'nice caboose' while I'm doing dishes.
And you have to transfer to a local to get to the bedroom.
This is your first time in a railroad apartment?
I'm just happy there's a bar car.
I've got a ticket to ride, but I don't care.
My landlord's intimidation tactics are getting bolder, but I'm not budging.
Can I get you anything from the dining car?
It feels like I've been working on the railroad. All the live long day.
Would you like some cake with that coffee? The dining car should be coming through in a couple of minutes
It makes it much easier to move the elephant from room to room.
That's okay. I'll just call an Uber.
The real estate agent said it was just steps away from public transportation.
Jeanette! What did I tell you? The first rule is to always cover your tracks.
We replaced the elephant in the room.
The contractor said we could choose between being railroaded and being shafted.
But does it spark joy?
When he said he was a trainspotter I thought we would be living in the English countryside.
Howard wanted a retirement hobby that would qualify for federal funding.
When you said the renovations were on track I did not expect this
We love our new home! Unfortunately, the bathroom is on the wrong side of the tracks.
It's just until the L train gets fixed.
Wait til you see Howard's new wheelchair.
Dinah, the neighbors ask that you refrain from blowing your horn before 8 a.m. on weekends.”
On the bright side, we no longer oversleep.
Roger married me because he liked my caboose.
The light at the end of the hallway is the 9:05.
He's big for his age.
My realtor was right. After three weeks you don't hear a thing.
On the plus side, we're selling squashed pennies on Etsy.
Like any man, Ed has a one-track mind. But I adore his transparency.
Is that the kettle whistling?
This is just a starter home. Our dream is to eventually live at the airport.
Hold on tight to your coffee ! ,  the next one's an Express.
I know rent is cheap, Susie, but this is why you do a walk-through before you sign a lease.
Yeah, I know, but we just fell in love with those hardwood floors.
I asked for track lights, not light tracks.
It was either this, or moving to Baltic Avenue.
The rent is very low; why do you ask?
Thomas and I recently moved in together.
Have you considered un-coupling?
The rental ad did say " Close to Public Transportation"
I didn't think he'd build it to scale.
I asked for a landline and they upsold me.
The other apartment we looked at said, a river runs through it.
It's mostly fine, except that the kids often hang out on the wrong side of the tracks.
Oh, those? Sometimes we do a little damsel-in-distress roleplay.
But, Mom, I don't want to be tied down.
Did  I mention that Bob is a railway buff?
It gets crowded around 5:15
Sleep is a problem, but the commute is a dream.
Thank God when he built it they did not come.
We won the eminent domain case... sort of....
We make the kids play outside because it’s actually a lot more safe.
It goes so well with our track lighting.
Did I mention Tom got a train set for Christmas?
Of course it's the right side.
Well the rent is cheap and cuts my commute time in half.

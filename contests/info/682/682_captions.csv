They must have made a fortune from the wheel.
We are going to go with Noah, but thanks.
I guarantee he brings up the whole discovering fire thing within the first five minutes.
What'd you expect?  She hunts-gathers, too , and they have no kids.
Of course it’s pretentious- didn’t you see the rock he gave her?
Four-story brownstones? It'll never catch on, not in a million years.
This makes our place look like a cave."
If you stopped drawing on the walls and got a real job maybe we could live here too.
They’re from prehistoric money
Of course you know that wheel was really her idea.
Ever since the Babels moved into that new apartment it’s like they’re speaking an entirely different language.
After dinner they want to go out clubbing.
I bet she can’t wait to brag about her new granite countertops.
Only your parents would find a way to visit before the invention of stairs.
We'll come back when stairs have been invented.
It's only a matter of time before some Neanderthal decides to name one after himself.
Congratulations... you got the Trump sign removed!
(whispering) Oh, god! A four-story walk up. Just wave and look busy.
I  remember when they were just cliff dwellers.
So begins the condolithic period.
Evidently his father invented the wheel.
You won’t believe the view!  We can see nothing for miles.
Any trouble finding the place?
It IS flat! Come on up and see for yourself!
I hope she remembered that we’re strictly paleo now
We won’t need a fire escape until someone discovers fire.
A 4th floor walk-up in the pre-historic district. I’d be smug too.
Sure, the view's great, but I hear the co-op board is a bunch of Neanderthals.
They must have taken out a mammoth mortgage.
It scrape sky.
They can afford it; they are a two-hunter family.
Come on up. But don't take the elevator. You'll be waiting a million years.
They may feel like the Flintstones now, but they're one earthquake away from being the Rubbles.
They haven’t changed, Bob...they’ve evolved.
Oh look darling; we just invented envy.
I can hear you but it is all babel!
Sorry we’re late! Parking was just nonexistent.
Wow. The wheel was for real. And we could have gotten in on the ground floor . . .
We took an Uber, but, in retrospect, we should've taken a Lyft.
I can't believe you invited gatherers over
Hey! We just invented stairs, come see!
How will we get up there Otis?
I can see Russia from my house!
What'll the Pents call their lovely, new top-floor place?
They jumped on it when the housing market was caving.
It sort of takes cave dwelling to new heights.
C'mon up, we're getting stoned
We brought flint for the housewarming.
Kids today. A cave was good enough for us.
This, my dear, is what separates the ‘caves’ from the ‘cave-nots
Let's just wave, it's a walk-up.
Yeah. Thunderstorm coming.
Well look who's all homo habilis!
Bye.  Write when you can.
I just don't understand the Babels.
I heard that her father invented the wheel.
Hey, Otis here just had a crazy idea.
Their bathroom's three floors up and there's no plumbing - that's all I'm saying.
Oh I love it!  Its so NEW stone age!
It's nice, but he has to kill mammoths, like, eighty hours a week.
Look it's the Pisas.  I guess the previous owner didn't tell them about the foundation.
Well,  we wouldn’t still be cave dwellers if you had listened to me and invested in their wheel invention.
It's a Cro-Mansion.
How they can afford a penthouse on a hunter-gatherer's salary, I'll never understand.
Are you ready to go clubbing?
We'll come up as soon as someone invents stairs
Hey come on in! We just invented the stairs!
I still think a one floor, open concept cave is much more livable."
Good luck with heating that during the ice age.
A fourth floor walkup? What is this, the stone age?
Oy. Fifth floor apartment, and their elevator won't be installed for another 20,000 years.
Remember your cave manners and no writing on the walls this time.
I told you gathering paid better.
Yeah, I heard they built it with all that wheel money.
Home-o Erectus.
They love to brag but it’s a walk-up.
We'd invite you up, but I just cut my hair.
Of course we're still alive, T-Rexes are only 3 stories tall.
Congrats on making it past the Neanderthals on the co-op board!
They've become such show-offs since they discovered fire.
Oh look, the Millers have moved from the Mezzanine up to the Pleistocene.
They put their pelts on one leg at a time just like us.
Well, I wouldn't want to carry a mastodon up there is all I'm saying.
We got our patent on the wheel!
Sorry, just cut my hair.  You'll have to walk up
Everyone's so much nicer since they took down the name.
Hold tight, Otis has this great idea
Her father invented the wheel
You can come down now. Trump just resigned!
And we have it for the same week every year!
Love it, but we’re thinking ark.
Her husband Jim, he's the guy who invented fire.
I've heard the artwork in the lobby is amazing.
Look, it’s the Rockefeller's!
It was a termite-colony foreclosure we picked up dirt cheap.
That place was built before fire codes.  Or fire.
Sure, it's a walk-up, but it's rent controlled.
Can you see that new Stonehenge from up there?
Last year the wheel, today the ladder.
How can he still call himself a "caveman" ?
Why did you invite them?! They can’t eat anything, we put out. 
It’s always “paleo this, paleo that”...!
No, you come down!
The penthouse?  That's amazing.  They only just started walking upright.
Okay, but the minute he starts blathering on about how little he paid for the cave paintings, we’re outta there.
Ever since we moved to Babel, it feels like my sister and I just don’t speak the same language.
They are the only ones, I hear, who are still living in the Trump Tower.
I guess this means means we’ll be getting a Whole Foods soon.
Welcome to our homo erectus !
It's a 4 story walk-up and it's tiny, but it still beats that cave we were in before.
- Look, I shaved my underarm!
- Me too!
Let your hair down and we'll be right up.
Forget the wheel! We've invented stairs!
Call us when you invent stairs.
As the Stone Age ended, the cycle of gentrification began again.
Congratulations! Looks like inventing the wheel paid off nicely.
We lucked out.  The previous tenant got eaten.
Nice cave, man.
A simple cave was never going to be enough for her!
Sorry we're late. Our wheel broke down.
Regarding the village names you suggested, we're leaning toward Pisa.
Wow, you really do get more for your money outside of Bedrock!
How nice can it be? There’s no doorman.
Is this Oliver and Meredith’s Tower of Prehistoric Swingers?
Sure their view is great, but he had to give up his man cave
Of course it's a walk-up. What else would it be?
Yeah, they can afford it.  They made a fortune selling those silly cave paintings of cows.
Show offs. Just wait until they realize indoor plumbing is still 100,000 years away.
The next big gust is coming. For a "C" sharp, block the second and fourth windows
Of course it's impressive. It's on the Prehistoric Register.
Is it a walk-up?
They’ll be out after they drag the first buffalo up those stairs!
This trumps our tower.
She says the style is "post-pre-historic" but it looks more neo-Neolithic to me.
She’s a Homo Erector and he has an Edifice Complex.
I love the way they added on without losing yard space.
I heard they were early wheel investors.
They're calling it Neanderth Hall.
Just smile, they totally overpaid.
You didn't tell me they live in a highrise. I would have worn my good fur.
Sorry we're late.  Our wheel is flat.
Don’t be mean Ugg. It does not look like a dinosaur feeder.
They're insufferable since they invented stairs.
The wheel is fine, but would it kill somebody to invent some stairs?
Don’t bring up her dad’s impeachment.
You must have a Pterodactyl's-eye view from up there.
I told you he's compensating for something.
Sure it's new, but it's still a four story climb up in the middle of nowhere.
Get ready to hear about his wheel invention all night long.
The penthouse apartment and rent controlled?  You guys are so lucky!
A cave with a view!? How did you ever find this place?
Holy crap. Rapunzel cut her hair, got married and bought a condo!
I bet it's a walkup.
If they make us put on those stupid house slippers again, I’m leaving.
Only a stone hedge fund manager could afford a rock like that...
Since they moved to Babel, it is like I just don't know what they're saying.
See, they never bring anything.  Not even a bladder of wine.
Just take the catapult up to the 5th floor
And to think my husband made fun of that wheel thing you invented!
Hi Julie! Hey, Noah! Still worried about sudden climate change, I see!
Oh no! She cut her hair!
You'll have to take the stairs. Elevator won't work for a couple thousand years.
I am sure the view is spectacular but I hear the super is a real Neanderthal."
GO THROUGH THE EVOLVING DOOR...
I'm not being obtuse, Margaret. I just don't think sand was the best choice.
They pay a mammoth rent.
Ask them if they can bring the mail up with them.
I hear they've got an original Lascaux.
Oh sure, penthouses are great until you realize you're living in a T-Rex snack cupboard.
I hate it when she brings that Neanderthal.
Sorry, it took us a while to find your building.
But sea levels aren't estimated to rise THAT much for at least another 12,000 years
We didn't really need directions.
Looks like Beth and Steve didn't get those last two seats on the Ark..
See? He didn’t insist on a man cave.
Remember to ask about their new cave painting.
Hi Carol! Hi Peter!...You know they can only afford that apartment because her dad invented fire.
They say that's the guy that invented the wheel.
They want to discuss a business opportunity, something called a pyramid scheme.
I can see Russia
What did he have to kill to get the penthouse?
the buzzard is broken - come on up
Hi, when did you get an above ground?
Don't be too jealous,  it's 30% dung
There goes the horizon.
They started a spear point business, and it took off from there.
He left hunting and gathering to go into commodities.
Thanks for having them over tonight Cheryl. Last time I saw them it was only me and the two of them and I was the third....you know,....the third....umm...., third......
I would come down, but we haven't invented stairs yet
I still think they built too close to the water.
He takes all the credit, but she got them in on the ground floor.
My sister married for money before it was even invented
I don't know how they can afford it, she's a stay-at-home gatherer.
They certainly didn't waste any time snapping up the penthouse after Rapunzel left.
Did you tell them we're on the paleo diet?
We invented stairs, come on up
The rope is out of order again. You'll have to walk up.
The Brownstone Age
We wanted the view - before it's gone.
The doorman's a bear -- but just ignore him!
We'll be up when stairs are invented.
Oh! You’re so lucky! You got the one with the mammoth view!
I just love these old brownstones.
I hate hearing about how they get their steps in every day.
I can't wait until someone invents stairs.
Inventing fire has been very, very good to you.
Act impressed and wave. The next tyrannosaurus rex will wipe that smile off their faces.
Their old home was a pit. This place, rocks.
Sorry we're late. We didn't have the exact address.
They're so pretentious since moving into Stump Tower.
No wonder they're always late to the party.
Hi, Rapunzel!   I see you've cut yout hair!
I never knew gatherers could be so upwardly mobile.
“They’re smiling now, but just wait until someone discovers fire.”
Just don't forget, they still have to haul up their berries and kills.
these motherfuckers— you know i used to work at the coöp with her, and she’s all righteous and earthy, basically a freegan, then her dad leaves her a ton of money and she quits that same day the dumb fucken— oh shit they see us, be nice, "Hey Elise!"
I still think the  classic deep cave in solid rock has better resale value long-term.
Oh, so that's what they meant by "Upper Paleolithic."
She told him she'd absolutely had it with the man-caves
First the wheel, and now this.
Hi, are the bears still living on the first floor?
But what I want to know is why are cavemen always white?
What are you talking about Tom? It’s 10,000 BC, of course it’s a walk-up!
Hey-looks like the board removed the Trump sign off of the building..
Stonehenge was impressive, but this is just showing off.
That could be us in 10,000 years.
They are so inventive, first the wheel, and now stairs.
She didn't even know him that long, and look at the size of that rock!
Tell me they didn’t need tools to build that!
I don’t care how good the view is, I’m still calling them cavemen,
You’re calling it a “brownstone walkup”? That’ll never stick...
So he has this idea to put rooms on top of each other, but he hasn’t worked out how to get back down
It is so hard keeping up with the Stoneses!
This is going to give the archaeologists a fit.
Sorry we’re late. We couldn’t find the place.
Can you see Russia from there?
Gathering must be good! A penthouse and a cave at the coast!
Makes our place look like the Stone Age.
Come on up. We can see Russia from here!
Shame they couldn't find something more down to earth.
Steve and I would love to visit, but we hear you'll have no elevator service for the next 11,724 years.
``Just smile. Keep walking. Wave. Don't slow down. They're insufferable.''
I thought you said the G7 summit WASN'T going to be held at trump tower!?
There are still few units left at rock bottom prices
They call it a high rise, but I don’t think it will ever catch on.
Adam and Eve discover capitalism.
We'll be down in an hour.
Things are going so well for them since she invented the wheel!
I know their sand castle looks nice, but wait until high tide.
What are you babbling about ?
Before he invented the wheel they were cave dwellers just like the rest of us.
I guess that wheel idea he kept talking about wasn't such a bad idea.
That wheel start up idea really worked out for them.
How, high are you?
See you in the Smithsonian.
Text us when you get the elevator installed.
'Penthouse, primal art and fixtures, natural light and room temperature - open fires every floor.'"
You'll eventually cave too!
I bet she mentions it's prewar within 5 minutes.
The neighborhood’s changing. I can see the writing on the wall.
I should have married a gatherer.
Wow.  First fire, then the wheel, and now this.
The Sandcastles liked to flaunt their wealth, but high tide always brought them back to earth.
Penthouse? I bet he got her a big rock too.
God, I hope it's not a walk up.
Hurry up, Ugan has another idea! He calls it a wheel.
I'll tell you this--the last tenant left a LOT of shampoo!
They struck it rich in bronze futures.
Sorry we're late. Thad wouldn't let us ask for directions.
It's a great investment.  Can you imagine what it'll go for in the bronze age?
What's she saying?  Crumb Tower?  Frump Tower?
My God, a penthouse that's actually occupied!
The very first episode of "Love It or List It".
She married a retired cliff dweller.
Well, it's a step up from his man cave.
Enjoy your stay. Don't forget you have fourteen days after checkout to write a review.
My husband has an idea for something he calls ‘stairs.’
They call it “The Top of the Rock”.
Look! It's the last Trump Tower!
There is no running water but we can almost see it from here
I know you gave me the address. What's an address?"
... and there’s underground parking for our wheel!
Og is compensating for something else.
Stairs" just don't get the same acclaim as "fire" or "the wheel.
Best part about this place is it is overlooking Jurassic Park.
It looks bigger in the brochure.
Mom, Dad, this is Tyler.  I may have suggested to him that we're gods.
It looks pretty much like the way the ants left it.
Sorry. All I'm hearing is babble.
They're so evolved.
We forgot how to get down but we love it here.
Sure, the view’s nice, but who wants to live in a place that doesn’t allow you to paint the walls of your own cave?
We are so stoned.
Live there? Not in a million years!
They always did think they were above us.
Here come the social climbers
Stop up for drinks and then we'll go clubbing.
I have no idea what a timeshare is, but at least we get a free dinner.
If we have to hear the story about their woolly mammoth rug one more time, I swear Susan...
Look! We invented windows!
Remember, if Steve tries to rent us one of his units again, don’t cave.
Why do you always wave ? She still has your casserole dish
I don't want to seem braggadocios but we did have to invent the number 5 to live up this high.
Welcome to our Home-o-Erectus!
Mazel tov! They finally took the Trump Tower sign off your building.
Jim just invented fire. Come for dinner!
This is a huge upgrade from that cave they were living in before
Told you they'd be in matching outfits....
I love your two water buffalo garage on your ground floor.
Let’s get stoned!
We should have met at the restaurant.
She did say her cave drawings were selling like crazy.”
And so began the time of condo-sapiens
We could have brought the wheel!  There's plenty of parking.
Contractor says windows and doors are 6-8 weeks out... at least.
The upper 1%, circa 7,000 BCE.
Mom, Dad, I thought you weren't coming home till 4.
I wish they’d stop flaunting their new pentcave.
WHAT, NO DOORMAN?
I can’t believe how fast this place is gentrifying.
Sorry we're late. Foot traffic was terrible.
The top unit was the only unit left.  It was last but not leased.
The view is good but the bathroom is on the ground floor.
Just smile. And don't say anything about the middle school not being accredited.
No, she left last month. She said she was tired of people checking out her hair.
SO YOU REALLY DID MOVE ON UP TO THE EASTSIDE..?
Rapunzel sold!  We're the new owners, c'mon up!
Yeah, but what do you want to bet it's a walk-up?
They better not draw on our walls.
Good morning! Welcome to the Brownstone Age.
So smug now that they're at the top of the food chain.
Living in the rock versus under it has really changed our point of view.
Hi Mom, this is Harold. I told you he looks just like Dad.
Karen thinks she's so important because her husband invented fire.
Another condo? I remember when that was just a big rock.”
We'll come up and visit when someone invents stairs.
I love what you’ve done with the entrance!!
He bought her a penthouse, it’s not like he discovered fire
Oh great, a walk-up.
We love your home. It's so neolithic!
We’ll visit as soon as the ladder is invented.
Come on up. We just invented stairs.
Look it's the Babels. I never know what they're talking about.
Hi Sheila! We love it! It has some beautiful petroglyphs on the walls, an incredible spear cellar in the basement and something our realtor said we had to have...a fireplace!
Look up, the 1 percent!
Come on up you two! Take the ladder marked “penthouse”.
Of all the floors the Pent's could occupy, they chose the top floor.
Let’s not invite them up, I hate matching outfits.
A fifth floor walk-up! It must be their starter place.
I can't believe they got the permits to build that tower. It completely ruins the skyline.
I thought their old place was cavernous...
It will never get better than this.
They say his dad got him started with just a few low income caves.
Just wave, smile, and keep going; I am not climbing up there!
Honey, how come we never can keep up with the Cro-Magnons?
As they approached the building, Joe once again regretted wearing matching outfits to meet his in-laws.
It has the comfort of a cave with a vista view.
We just visited Noah, he said you are well prepared!
Alexa will let you in
The pyramid was a scam after all.
Is it okay if a couple of Neanderthals come up for a visit?
Congratulations on moving to the Upper East Side!
Can't wait to see what you've done with the walls!
They moved here from the coast after too many biblical floods.
They are definitely looking down on us.
Sorry we're late! The GPS took us to the middle of nowhere.
See? This is why we need the new zoning ordinance.
whaddya mean you cut your hair?
I have the same dress!
Look !   I cut my hair !
I've heard he invented something called stairs
How did they afford that on a scavenger’s salary?
Who cares about the wheel, know anyone that can build stairs?
First the wheel, now this. Isn’t Mike amazing?’!
The value is going to skyrocket once we invent stairs.
Just remember your manners and try not to be such a neanderthal.
Wouldn't  you know they'd  be the first to have stairs.
We caved and got the penthouse!
First the wheel, now this!
Smile and wave honey. They'll be extinct before they can afford our rent.
What else is he making up for?
They're calling it a Brownstone.
Waive to the Babels honey.
It is one story after the rainy season.
Caves are so last year.
Hit the buzzard, I’ll let you in.
How I loathe coming to game night, they always act like they're above us
Sorry we're early, but hey, we're early humans.
Just let yourself up. The doorman got eaten by raptors.
I told you if you built it we would come...
I see you caved and bought the penthouse!
We can't understand any of your babel.
We moved on up.
C'mon up.  Howard has a new man cave.
Remind your brother that the co-op frowns on wall drawings.
Who cares if  they've got a view?  It's a fifth floor walk-up!
Great apartment--must be nice to have invented the wheel.
Hey sis! Guess who invented the ladder!!
They were early investors in the hand-axe.
Thank God they didn’t build that in my neighborhood.
Those Smiths.. Always showing off how evolved they are.
Remember to be impressed when they talk about their two-wheel garage.
Once someone invents the staircase, we’d love to have you up for dinner.
I  bet their murals are amazing.
We’ll come back when stairs are invented.
Best views in the village, but their paleo dinners suck
Earliest recorded Airbnb booking.
Look honey, it's that new couple the Jones's!
Ugh.  Cro-Magnons think they're so much better than Neanderthals.
Welcome to our humble adobe.
Too modern!
Nice Digs, does it have a man cave?
The Top 1 Percent
Wow! What a view you must have. I bet you can see Stonehenge.
I knew we should've worn our nice pelts.
They don't identify as cave-people.
I can't believe they chose the brownstone walk-up.
You're gonna love them. She makes clothes for a living. And he whacks things with a rock to see what will happen.
I thought the evolutionary ladder was just a metaphor.
You're welcome to stay with us if it starts leaning.
There's just no dealing with them since their cave went condo
We thought about it, but we're finally free and clear on the cave and just want to enjoy that for now.
I love  it's  mid-Pleistocene design.
Hey, how's the dawn of civilization looking from up there?
C'mon in - the Otis guy is inventing something that he says will help.
Hey, there’s Alice! She tells me the view is great, but the wi-fi sucks.
you guys know that the tide comes back up, right?
It use to be a termite mound.  Whaddya think?
The yard is "meh."
I’d say come up but I don’t know how we got here!
How evolved! Does it have a man cave?
Let us know when you invent stairs and we'll come visit!
See, we too could live in luxury if you just stepped up your hunting and gathering a bit.
We hadn't seen them for Ages!
5th floor walk up. How bohemian!
I hate how thin she looks since she started that Paleo diet.
Once we invent the ladder, we'll invite you up!
It’s so brazenly post-Neanderthalic!
We'd invite you up, but Rapunzel has Alopecia.
Welcome to Trump Sand Castle. There's no elevator yet, but he promised.
Hurry up - happy era just started!
It’s a smart move for empty cavers.
Oh look honey, Marge and Ed have entered the Upper Paleolithic Age.
But how on earth did you get up there?
Can you believe it? All those walls and not one painting!
You see Roger? You get so much more for your money if you're prepared to buy in a mostly Cro Magnon area.
All this just from 'the wheel'?
We can remain friends, even though we no longer share the same worldview.
It was easy! You’re the only brownstone for miles.
Can we take the elevator? He’s tired from upright walking.
It's lovely!  And everything came from Cave Depot?
Before you get jealous, I heard their sex life's terrible.
Check it out.  We invented the elevator shaft."
Looks like he finally caved!
Should we tell them that high tide is in two hours?
As Gertrude looked up with excitement, Bob knew his hunter gatherer days were numbered.
Don't forget to learn to write.
It's great - we can see all of known society from here!
Hey Otis, how did you get up there?
She is still just Jenny from the Rock.
If they start talking about Time Shares, I’m leaving.
I hope they don't spend the whole night talking about all the weight they've lost on the paleo diet again.
They may look happy, but their marriage is on the rocks.
Well,  somebody's "compensating"!
Makes our cave seem prehistoric.
Oh great! Now every inch of Manhattan has been developed!
First came fire, then the wheel, and at long last, the timeshare.
Yes, their wallpaper's ghastly. Yes, they drew it themselves. No, you don't have to comment on it after your third skull of mead.
Guess who climbed up when I let down my hair!
We'll invent the ladder and be right up.
I want the same thing only taller.
Come on up.  Otis has a new invention!  Push 5.
Check this place out - all exposed stone!”
They want to tell us about their new invention, the timeshare.
" I wonder which rock she found him under. "
They left the cave for a 5th-floor walk-up?
Apparently, he was an angel investor in the wheel.
You bought this sand castle kit at IKEA ?
Hi Otis! What are you working on?
Hey Wilma, you need to show Fred the neat new contraption Otis just invented.  Just get in the cage and jab the number 5 Mastodon in the ass.
We'll be up when elevators are invented
It's gonna take extinction to get out of that time-share.
Congratulations on fighting for multi-story zoning!
We'll visit after someone invents stairs.
Honey, stop waving at the gentrifiers.
Well, she wanted THE view, so he caved in.
Zog thinks it’s too much cave for us, but I disagree.
It's an anthill. They're delicious. Come on up.
Steve and Lisa seem nice, but these new developments have really changed the neighborhood. Now it's all cultivated grains and overpriced bone broth.
Sorry, Rapunzel doesn't live here anymore.
Harry recently invented the pail and shovel, and well, one thing just led to another
If you hurry, you can get in on the ground floor.
Sure, it's nice, but it wiped out so much of the neighborhood's prehistory.
Hopefully they won’t spend the whole night whining about their condo fees again.
Someday this will be known as the Condolithic age.
Just smile and wave, so Frank Wheel got to the patent office ahead of you, get over it.
Sure they live in a penthouse...
her father made a killing in boulders!"
He made all his money in recently created fuels.
They're building a whole circle of these, opening to the Summer Solstice.
This must be the Tower of Babel because I can't understand a word you're saying
So why are we still stuck in a cave?
I can't believe these vertical caves will ever take off.
what do you think they're compensating for?
Gentrification has ruined everything.
No way I’m helping pack out his rocks and boulders when they move again.
No Sarah, we can't see Russia from up here.
Great... This time I'll eat the Paleo T-Rex steak, and he picks up the check.
Oh, my God, a fifth floor walk-up... Pretend that it's great.
Take the stairs. We just invented them.
I can’t believe Marcia and Dan are wearing matching pelts again...
They're the epitome of upright mobility.
What are stairs?
Thanks again for watching the pterodactyl while we're gone!
They get a 4th floor walk up and now they think they’re gods.
This will never catch on.
You should see the art in their lobby!
What the hell is this? We haven't even invented stairs or elevators yet!
It's a new development called the Tower of Babel!
Maybe we should tell them it’s built on a fault line
Hi Neighbors. Does this remind you of the New Yorker Rapunzel cartoon from a couple of months ago, too?
I wonder what they pay in axes.
We flipped the cave for windows and a view.
Now THAT'S a sandcastle !
Hello! Should we pick up some fire before heading up?
I can't believe the Flintstones bought the penthouse suite at Trump Tower!
If Brock tries to tell us about how he invented the wheel again I swear I’m going to jump.
Is it a pre-war or pre-historic walkup?
It’s mid-century pre-historic!
No jokes about global warming and when the flood is coming!
They invented stairs to keep the Neanderthals out of the neighborhood.
They caved and got a fifth-floor walk-up.
Yes, it’s a walk-up. Of course it’s a walk-up. What did you expect?
Yes, Honey, he did want a man cave, more than almost anything.
You go girl, he invents the wheel and you get a penthouse!
Hey,look!  I was right...told you so!  The Earth is flat!
They bought last year. Have you been living in a cave
I hope he invented the fire escape as well.
You’ll be just fine.  The tide will never come this far!
Now Harry, please don't make fun of their very, very long legs.
We're naked up here!
Just look at those Jones.  Last month they bought a car before the wheel was invented, now they live in a high rise without an elevator."
Can you imagine having to haul a wooly mammoth carcass up all those steps?  I'll keep my one story cave, thank you.
I love what you did with your mound!
Cro-Magonminiums
Cool building. But I’ve heard that their neighbors are Neanderthals.
Isn't it nice? They used their new homo erector set!
I can't believe they found a pre-war building with an elevator.
Ever since they convinced everyone to wear clothing, they can’t find enough ways to spend the money.
We are on our way down, see you in an hour
You may feel smug now, atop your sandcastle, but the tide comes in in just two hours.
I'll be damned, Krog and Linda bought a penthouse. Must have been a good year for hunting and gathering.
Nice evolving, Thagette!
It's called a TowneHouse.  It comes with fire, a wheel and enough wall space to draw on for ages.
Look how happy they are! I told you that stone and mortar was a great investment!
Look, honey, the Johnsons built a T-rex feeder!
I don't know where they get the rubble to pay for it.
It's a walk-up but we got a great deal
That's nice, but is it rent controlled?
Of course it’s a walk up, how else could we afford it?
Can you believe it? A four-story climb-up!
Oh shit, they saw us. Act like you're just a friend.
Look, it's the Jefferstones.
We heard you invented stairs!
Yeah, they caved in and moved to an apartment.
what do you mean, you cut your hair!
It's nice that they live only a stone's throw away.
Look. It's the Trumps.
Wow! They got the best box seats so we can watch the game before we eat it!
Don't cry for me, Mesopotamia.
I predict that, in the future, buildings will only grow bigger, taller, and more penis-shaped.
Hard Rock Hotel? What's a "hotel"?
Pre-war? This is pre-door. Wave and walk, wave and walk.
Did you ever notice how they're always looking down at us?
Your old drawings in the cave don't even compare!"
I still don't think they know how high tide works.
Look at the building Jake made for Nora... and you can't even fix the mammoth trap.
Yeah, it'll be awesome once someone invents stairs.
Wait...What are you standing on?
Can't tell you how happy we are to see you guys ! Can you put the ladder back up ?
Is this the church of Ladder Day Saints?
We'll come down when the election is over.
Our realtor said it's still technically Williamsburg
Stone Age Towers
What! Look at you two. You bought the pentcave!
Nice try, Helen, but my armpit is still hairier than yours.
Come up! You can see Mesopotamia from our house!
Hi Melania!
Sorry we didn't call first
She told me they were living in the first "brownstone," whatever that is.
Just smile. She found a guy she likes who’s good with a pail and shovel. Don’t spoil it by telling her when the tide comes in, they’re toast.
They are such social climbers!
Man invents house envy. 3,500 B.C.
Skyscraper? They’ll always be knuckle draggers to me, Carl.
You two finally got the penthouse. Congrats.
Welcome to the Grand Opening of 30 Rock!
This is the model. My dream is a descendant will fill the land with towers and then profit by having visiting dignitaries stay there.
Imagine schlepping those stairs with a ton of mastodon steaks?
A great view...They can see the tarpits from that window!
Are we the first ones here?
Congratulations! They approved your height variance last night!
Drumpf built it - he's calling it the Drumpf Tower !
Someday we'll own lots of these, fill them with shit, and become President of the Greatest Democracy On Earth.
Rapunzel, what did you do to your hair, girl?
Is that a walkup?
I hate her.
I knew you'd finally cave in!
We're staying at The Mirage!
He carved this all from one stone and you are still working on this so called wheel.
Thanks for the offer, but no. We like the pool at the Ramada
Oh we’re still out in The Caves at Mammoth Point. Just here for brunch!
Sorry, you'll have to climb the stairs. The elevator hasn't been invented yet.
I can't believe they paid so much for a 4th floor walk up.
See. Just a stone’s throw away.
Wow.  Who knew inventing the wheel could be so lucrative.
We’ll see how happy they are after the first rain!
It looks like the Rockwell's caved-in and bought the high rise
They've always found a way to look down on us.
It is all that wheel money
Is it just me, or do they look like they're overcompensating?
See how well they do when the ice cream truck goes by
Bill said they're called windows!
No, I'm not jealous they got a penthouse. It's a walk-up.
Well sure, she looks happy - but I'd never let you drag me up four flights of stairs...
Come on up! It’s apartment 10,000B.C.
The elevator’s broken. I’ll wake up Rapunzel.
They can go spelunk themselves.
Come into the lobby and get in the box. We will pull  you up.
It's almost like we never came down from the trees in the first place!
If it weren't the late Pleistocene, I'd be insanely jealous.
Of course it’s high. That’s why it’s called the Stone Age.
They took the fifth-floor rock-up... yikes...
Don't wave at them. This is a class divided society now.
Just be sure you're home before the tide comes in!
They’re a nice couple, but I’m tired of that trendy paleo diet they’re always on about.
love what you've done with the termite mound!
Merely walking upright wasn’t enough?
Don't be jealous. It's a walk-up.
Drop us a line when you get settled,"
No elevator? These guys are stuck in the brownstone age
Nice now but what happens when they get too old to climb the walls?
I don't care if it's the latest trend, our old cave offers exactly the same amenities - refuge and shelter.
Try to act impressed and don’t tell them we dwell in a one story cave.
It's called a high-rise cave environment. Lots more room to draw on the walls, too.
Look, Howard, it’s the Jeffersons.
Lovely place. So glad you got the zoning change.
Thank goodness they haven't discovered fire yet or this place would be a safety hazard.
We call it hump tower
We just saved a lot of money by switching to Geico.
Are you staying at The Cave down the street?
No wonder their rent is five times higher than ours.
A year ago, there was just a cave here!
It’s ok. We’ll wait until the elevator is invented.
Way to flip a termite mound!
luxury condos...that'll never catch on
Someone's been busy.
And you wouldn't believe it's rent controlled!
4th Floor and no plumbing?-no thanks.
Love what you've done to your hair, Rapunzel!
My God, Agnes, you were so right. Kissing ass really does pay off.
Don't roll your eyes if they say it's "neoloftic".
They haven't invented how to get down yet.
Welcome to our new land-before-time share!
A walk-up is fine when you’re young, but my knees prefer a one-story cave.
A rent-controlled penthouse! How could you have been so lucky, Wilma?
When your hair gets longer we can come up and see your new place.
Hello!  Come on up, we’re on floor ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.
Why? Oy, what can I say, no elevator, but it's rent controlled
Big deal--bet it's walk-up.
Grok caved in and built me a high rise!
Impressive but will it cave in?
Here's a pizza - catch!
Love the new walkup. So Neolithic!
I hear it gets very drafty at night.
Sorry, the elevator's out of service again. We might have to wake up Rapunzel.
What do you mean? Of COURSE it's a walk-up!
Hey mom, throw down some money. I hear the Good Humor truck.
Charming brownstone!
Highly evolved.
Hi ! We hollowed out the neck of a diplodocus and invented architecture, what are you guys up to ?
You invented the vertical cave!
No we don't. What's an elevator?
Love it! Harry says he’ll chisel me one too.
Now that’s what I call NeanderTALL!
Be sure to admire the stairs. They invented them.
You were right, we love condo living.
Lucy! Ogg! When did you folks evolve?
Sorry we can't come down to visit. Stairs haven't been invented yet.
Nice, but the bathroom is on the first floor.
He hit it big in the pits trading crude oil futures contracts.
Oh look, it's the Otises, I hope they don't mind all the stairs.
Congrats on evolving into Home Erectus!
Five floors? They're really trying to keep up with the Sapiens.
I don't understand.   You're just babeling.
Sorry we're late.  We had to walk as our wheel is in the shop.
Hi, we're hunting for a gathering.  Is it here?
Look Carl, the Johnson’s are evolving.
We're apartment sitting for the Kushners!
Keep the faith, Noah!
The termites left so we moved in; it's called a Hive Rise.
What an eyesore, gentrification is really ruining this neighborhood. ...Oh hey Betsy!
Up stares; down stares
No doorman, fourth-floor walk-up—what are Maud and Bill living in? The Paleolithic Era?
Can you believe they're only paying four tusks a month for this place?
Just look at his face, Marge. This place was totally worth the money.
Looks like architecture just entered the Erectus period, too.
'The bells aren't working...come on up"
Destroys the view for the rest of us.
It's called Babel Towers
Rapunzel ran away with a prince.  You'll have to use the stairs"
Darg must be doing well. They also have a beachfront cave at the tar pits.
Now that’s a woman cave!
At least their name isn’t on it
I know it's a walkup,but look at that view!
We'll be down as soon as Rapunzel gets home.
I would let you in, but I've cut my hair.
The real estate agent sold us on the unobstructed view.
Is that an authentic brownstone?
It was a total makeover.  She cut her hair, and they added three windows and a door.
OK, We'll take the elevator.
Someone had to invent elitism.
Yeah it's nice, but what the hell is a "condo"?
The buzzer doesn’t work
Otis, I think you need to find a better way to get us up there.
Stop babbling!
And so, the Rocky-Fella dynasty began.
We like your caveominium.  Is the  hairway  in the back?
A fourth-floor walk-up at their age?

Anything to get out of the cave, I guess.
Come on up. You can see the Bronze Age from here!
They must have a good Cretaceous score.
You didn't tell me it was a climb-up.
Bye bye!
--I never understand a word they say.
You can take the elevator, but it's a little rocky.
Day one of the Timeshareozoic Era.
It’s so neo-anderthal.
Ask them if you'll get your security deposit back if you paint on the walls.
Elevation?  Yes.  Evolution?  No.
Are you gonna let down your hair or what?
I hate visiting them ever since she cut her hair.
Manhattan, 1950 BCE
Oh Hi! Sorry. The elevator's out.
Betty, I'm sure you guys love your new brownstone but think how much more you're going to love it once stairs are invented?
Here comes the cave dwellers.
A four story walkup. At their age!
No, but we are hunting for a gathering.
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
You'll just love their decor! It's neo Paleolithic.
Seems like we haven’t seen you since the last ice age!
Vertical caves are the next big thing.
Well, aren’t you a couple of early risers!
Waiting For Otis
Their hunting and gathering has worked out well.
Long prehistoric time, no see.
I hear he may run for tribal president.
We love condo living...you should see his new man cave!
They bid low, but the sellers decided to cave.
Hi, we'd love to come up. Is that Rapunzel girl with you
Somehow we knew you would take the Fifth.
And don't talk about sports. You can turn into such a Neanderthal.
They are always so friendly before the floods
It's nice, but have they invented stairs yet?
You knew they wouldn't be happy until they could brag about living atop the tallest building in the world.
We added yeast to the adobe!
I gather that Crag got headhunted by that big wheel manufacturer.
I'd invite you up but I recently cut my hair.
...of course they had to have the pentcave...
The character of pre-war buildings is unbeatable.
It so convenient. We can feed our dinosaur from here.
Nice ascent, man!
Of course it won a prize. What architect would vote for a cave?
So typical of the Troglers to skimp on landscaping
Hello Betty, it's been eons!
Fabulous place!  Those GEICO ads really paid off for you!
Hi Mom, I love what you've done with the ivory.
Hey, they made it to the Top of the Rock!
Sorry we're late -- parking was a nightmare!
They said they invented something called 'rent control'.
We found you on AirBNB
You need to move out of there.  The writing is on the wall.
They bought it with their winnings from Flat, Round, Stone of Fortune.
It’s been 10 years and they still don’t have a single widow dressing.
She wants us to come up through the WHAT escape?
Soon everybody's gonna wanna walk-up, right?
He invented the wheel!
It's more climb-up than walk-up, but we made it.
Nice enough couple,  just can’t keep up with the Stoneses.
They say these Stacked Caves are the      
wave of the future
It's official; the Pleistocene Epoch has been gentrified.
I just adore a pentcave view!
Welcome.  Of course, it's a walk-up.
And so began a grand tradition of innovation outpacing infrastructure.
And, the best part is you can see the Mesozoic swamp from there.
But this is the Pleistocene not the mezzanine!
Hey there! Is Rapunzel home?
I wouldn't have paid half a woolly mammoth for a 5th floor walk-up.
Come up for a club soda!
Hey, look what baking dirt and water can do!
Sure, it's a fifth-floor walk-up, but the views are spectacular.
That's Bob and Sheryl. They invented the wheel AND stairs.
Welcome to Prehistoric Swingers Of Pompano Beach
Hi, we'll see you in an hour.
"Anyone who says we're not as evolved has GOT to check out Mary's wallpaper choice."
Movin' on Up, to the beast side.
Damn it Honey, the Joneses outdid us again.
Hi guys! We were afraid you’d have trouble finding us. They took the big, gold TRUMP down last week.
Is the top one the only Airbnb ?
Thanks for having us...don't forget to chisel.
Too bad they didn't know that all the cool people go horizontal."
Larry and Marge moved into the penthouse.
Soon to be called the T-Rex take out window.
You better come down or God will smite you with multilingualism!
I heard that Trog cashed in on his father’s clout.
I am jealous, Brutt. Promise me we will move to a taller tree tonight.
Wow! It's Neandertall.
Too bad these high-rise caves overlook the tar pits.
She said the penthouse would make it easier to feed her dinosaur but I know she just wanted to look down on us.
I hate the Joneses.
Great flip!
This will show that wheel guy.
For their sake, I hope somebody invents stairs soon.
Welcome to the Post Rapunzel Era!  You'll find the stairs inside.
Keep walking.. their elevator doesn't exist yet, and I'm not climbing..
You caved?
They're always bragging about the view.
It has a great view of Jurassic Park!
She wasn’t so fancy back in the Miocene era, Charles.
Someone's desperately trying to keep up with the Flinstones.
I heard your rent is rock solid.
It is the newest thing in urban living.  We call it a "Crognaminium"!
Hi-ho! Your new place rocks!
We're here for the block party!
God I hope they have earthquake insurance.
Looks like Bill got promoted to hunter.
We’re really getting priced out of this neighborhood.
Babel, Babel, Babel
Wow, Sarah! Didn't know what you meant by a high-rise cave!
Look, it's the modern stone-age family!
Look Grom, they're calling it a brown stone building.
Promise me we'll never buy a fourth floor walk-up.
Welcome to our 4 stoney walkup!
This walk-up doesn’t work for hunters, we are strictly gatherers now.
I dig your new cave, man.
My sister loves the view, but she's still waiting for Lloyd to invent stairs ....
Those Jones's, seriously?
I like your vertical cave.
Hi Hilda, sorry we're late.  The MTA was slower than a three-toed sloth.
It’s Og and Ogette. Talk about Babel!
Chip! Joanna! Up here!
Can you please put your arms down? I can smell it from here
People, I don't get it, leaving a comfortable cave for a sand castle tower?
Look, Honey--They got the penthouse in Babel.
Careful Icarus.
We better invent fire escapes.
It was a pile of crap before they renovated.
Ooooh Archie, look! It's the Jeffersons!
Look at them up there:  pretentious and prehensile.
You've moved up in the world!
It's terribly expensive but it guarantees us an audience with Donald the Hun.
It's called a Rise-High!
I’m glad you added more wall space  because I have a long story to tell you!
Got water?
Wow, they went for the fifth-floor climbup.
No future in wheels, huh? I think that penthouse cave tells a different story...
Friends in high places rock!
You didn't tell me they have a penthouse
Can you see our cave from there?
Who needs a gym when you live in a 4 story rock-up!
Is there a rooftop pool?
I know your heart is in painting, but someday I'd like to be able to afford more than just a cave."
If you get a subpoena just say you have absolutely no idea, but, if you must know, we were given the penthouse as the quid pro quo.
I think they are too ahead of their time.
Another high rise? Soon it will be too expensive to forage here.
I love how they all look like ants from up here.
It was just standing there, shiny black and humming, so they decided to carve it out.
Love the new monolith!
Hey, you two! Loving the new Mid-Paleolithic Modern!
This gentrification is going to take us back to the stone age
What’s she babbling about?
They cant afford it you know. He hasn't been able to hunt for months.
Hi Carol! ...she claims it’s a Mesolithic Revival, but those boxy Paleolithic Colonial windows say otherwise.
I think they call it a 'Babel'.
The day the cavemen learned the word "Gentrification."
It’s okay, Harold. They no longer have the pterodactyl problem.
You left your Cave Cod home for a fourth-floor spelunk-up?
Barney, they have really made it...  top floor penthouse in the Tower of Babylon!
They sure got uppity since they redefined themselves as Condo-Magnons.
Yeah the views are great but who wants to live in a fifth-floor rock-up?
Wow! I love what you've done with your Mound!
We would have arrived sooner, but we had to invent the wheel first.
I'd tell you to take the elevator, but it's 3,000 B.C.
Gentrification circa 10,000 B.C.
Ug, look,  the new vertical cave!
Hi!  We'll buzz you in!
We’re in 5D
Wow, a high five!
We agree! Drumpf Tower it is! What a bigly name!
Can't wait for them to invent the elevator.
What makes you think they look down on us?
Wow! You guys have really evolved!
We'll come up as soon as the elevator is invented.
Hi. Elevator's broken, you'll have to climb. I'll buzz you in.
Wow, you guys have the Pez penthouse!
These new high rises are really destroying the aesthetics of our neighborhood.
Hi!"
"Yes it is.
He invented the wheel and now they're both rolling in the money.
Welcome cave dwellers.
Great, more gentrification.
Hey, look, we invented subprime!
We need to start watching HGTV.
Madge...I can see your cave from here.
Let yourselves in.  Our doorman got eaten by a woolly mammoth.
What’s a garage?
Looks drafty.
Wait, what do they call them again?  Stairs?
Is it just me, or do the Rubbles seem more uppity to you since they bought the penthouse suite?"
You ask me, their top floor apartment just makes them easy prey for a giganotosaurus.
What, your last place too primitive?
Come on up. The elevator hasn't been invented yet!
It was this or the wheel.
WILMAAAAAAA!
I hope that they did not only invent the skyscraper but also the elevator.
There goes the neighbourhood!
Honey, you remember the Joneses.
Quick Terry change your outfit, we’re going to look ridiculous all dressed the same
They always have to build something bigger and outdo everyone. They should call it Trump Tower.
She looks so much happier with her hair cut short.
Come see our view of the forest primeval!
Now if only someone would invent a stairway.
Mom, Dad, meet my boyfriend, Stoné.  He lives in a cave cave, but he's potentially civilizable."
Tiny bone jewelry, who knew?
Oh no  Jim and Amy wore the same costume
Be nice! They might have WiFi!
We’ll be down in a Jurassic moment”.
Yes, it’s a nice view but let’s not forget that his real plan was to make a mountain out of that molehill.
Hi! We'd have the doorman let you up but nobody's invented doors yet.
Come on up.We are waiting for the elevator mechanic.
Ours has six stories.
And thus began keeping up with the Jones's.
The elevator had better be invented by the time we get to the door.
They say the trash chute works great.
Bob, I know you hate these dinners with my Aunt; but if we want the house when she dies we have to be nice so shut up, smile, and wave.
No, this is 30 Rock. Rockefeller Center is just up the path.
Looks like The Jeffersons finally got a piece of the pie?
We'll come back when you get an elevator...whatever that is.
We should have invested in these volcano shares, too.
They may be “movin’ on up”, but she still decorated the place with her ceramic trilobite collection.
So this is the Condo of Babel?
A man's home is his sandcastle
What the hell are stairs?
Maybe we can afford a penthouse cave once you make partner.
Yes, we just got our Flu shot.
Yeah, but the association fees are one shiny rock.
The stairs are around the back .
Idiots. That's right at apatosaurus height.
Love the stone motif.
No, you come down. I might be afraid of heights.
We'll buzz you in.
Just a quick visit before the tide comes in.
Great, but is he good at "gathering"?
Hi Betty! Hi Bob! Nice place you've hewn.
The first multi-story with a man cave. He must be happy!
Did you invent the elevator yet?
Hi Linda! I brought that guy from the club that was hitting on me.
Honey, say hi to the Stonehenges.  They just moved in.
Come on up before high tide!
We’ll wait until they invent elevators
Did you invent stairs yet?
Inventing fire has been good to you.
Love your matching outfits.
Homo erectus isn't fooling anyone.
It’s so much easier not having to climb the stairs on all fours.....
Iksnay on the water balloonsay until they’re directly undersay
Wow, inviting fire really paid off for them!
Didja have to move to a fifth floor walk-up?
It’s rent controlled
If they really wanted us to visit, they would have made stairs.
Eat your heart out Noah.
When you said you were staying at the Sands Hotel, I thought you meant in Vegas.
Get decent-We're coming up!
Oh, look, dear--the Bradleys have become a higher life form.
Sorry we're late.  Fred's always re-inventing the wheel."
Their penthouse suite is nice as vacation rentals go, but without a moat there’s a security issue.
Honey, if bronze is so bad, I don't want to be good.
I’m ready to trade.  I’ll send Sam up.  You send Bob down.
The new Hard Rock Hotel​ is looking pretty nice.
Doormen on strike again?
They were never ones to keep their feet on the ground.
So this is the new walk-up dwelling you've been talking about.
It's so post-Neanderthal.
Welcome to the big city!
Ok I give up.  How did you get up there?
They had to tear down a cave to build this
Nice!  The penthouse!
Do they have an elevator? Or is she going to let down her hair...
We'll be right down. Just gotta set the Betamax to record.
Remember, my dad’s a caveman and isn’t going to approve of this.
You finally caved and remodeled!
A four story walk up? You’ve got to be kidding me?
You were right! Your place is above T. Rex level!
I like her, but most of what she says is just babel.
I can't believe you guys moved into the Trump Dump Tower. 
It's going to collapse real soon.
Thank God they’re in that tower. All she ever does is Babylon and on. Frankly, it’s like she’s speaking a different language altogether.
Too bad it’s a walk-up
I can’t understand what they’re Babelling about.
They've come a long way since the cave years.
I think it's great. They call it a brown stone.
Dial rock, rock, bone—we'll buzz you up!
They’ve always been a hunter-gatherer power couple. The co-op board really liked that.
It's just us; you can let down your hair.
What do you mean ‘What’s up?’ You’re what’s up.
We’d like to sell you a home security system.
Sorry we're late. Our camel broke down and we had to walk the rest of the way."
Thanks again, you guys rock!
Help! AirBnB is holding us hostage!
It's such a lovely brownstone.
Can you imagine carrying your hunted and gathered up those stairs?
He calls his new thing Real Estate but I doubt there is a future in it.
I can't wait for you to meet the Flintstones honey!
They don't clean, They just build another story and move upstairs...
Sorry we're late. The traffic was horrendous.
I just adore a penthouse view!
As an engineer, he worked tirelessly to find ways to look down on others.
It's a walkup but look at all this natural light!
And so, the early condo-man era began.
Just wait’ll we invent a ladders!
Sorry. No stairs. Use the Mastodon in the back.
It's not very spacious but it's rent controlled.
I still can’t believe they live in a giant clarinet.
First time it rains, their home will turn to mud.
Karen! I just saw your episode of Fixer Upper!
We got a great re-fi! In 9005 B.C. it will be all ours!
I told you our neighborhood would be gentrified. LOOK!
Can you believe the view they have of the Tar Pits?
It's what you don't see that's amazing...they're both basketball players.
Any luck with the invention of stairs yet?
Not my cup of tea Bob.  Too minimalist, too open concept 
but love the neutral palette.
Did you bring ladder and wine?
Ring the bell when you get on the elevator and I’ll put 4 stones on in the bucket!
It's nice and she says it even has a parking garage. What the hell is parking?"
Wait, are we sharing the flat with the Airbnb hosts?
Welcome!   The catapult is over there to your right.
The Neandertalls think they are so much better than us.
I prefer something with a more open concept
You've come up in the Neanderthal world!
Sorry, the elevator isn't working today. Our dinosaur has the day off.
Hi, Betty and Barney -- can we come up to see your new condo?
It's a short trip from the penthouse to the outhouse.
We'll come up to visit you as soon as we invent stairs!'
The latest Trump tower, said he was  losing money  in office.
Sorry we're late. Got a little lost at the first palm tree.
This high-rise thing will never catch on here!
You’ll never get me up in one of those things.
Come on up, I'll throw the vine down for you!
They say it will all be fields around here one day.
It’s a mammoth viewing platform
Look Honey. I told you they have a penthouse apartment.
Hey! You know you've moved into a giant anthill and not a high rise condo!
Cave dans le ciel. I’m there.
You did it, Gloria ! You slept your way to the top.
What happened to the moat?
Welcome to FlintstoneTower!
Don't you have any friends in low places?
Well, of course it's a walk-up, but they got a rock-bottom price.
Karen! Brian! You can come up as soon as we invent stairs!
I TOLD you paleo-gentrification was a thing, Ogg. We couldn't afford a lean-to in this neighborhood now.
‘You’ve solved the curtain problem !’
Hi!  (They are such social climbers.)
Come on up! We're in 4A
Act natural honey, it's the owners of Stump Tower
Welcome to our new come.  Take the rope to the fifth floor.
One of Trump's early projects.

You had better move down a floor. We're not going to pay for a penthouse any more.
Once we invent fire, they're going to want to be on a lower floor.
I'll go down and shake the hand that brings us pizza.

The blinders are more for his self-esteem, to be honest.
...except in this case, if you don't get right back in the saddle, you get eaten !'
All I had to do was take a thorn out of his paw, and now he's mine!

If you have to ask the price, you probably can't afford it.
He doesn't know he's a cat, basically.
I know, but if he sees a bird he goes nuts.

That Tony Robbins seminar was totally life changing.
It's a much smoother ride than the dog
All you have to say is "Kttyup!"

Alright, kittyup.
It’s a great way to get around, but feeding time is the worst.
You can't imagine the difficulty in saddling her.
Who says you can’t herd cats?

They are paying me $20 to take part in this lab study.  You should sign up too.
She wonders if you'd like to come for dinner!
I'm being taken for a ride.
Wait 'til the catnip wears off."
Now we take on the dog.  Are you with me?
It’s not just the blinders, it’s knowing how to sweet talk
Hard to handle? Once you get him going he purrs right along.
Like I told ya, once we can talk, anything is possible.
I guess it's probably safer than that Ford Pinto he was driving around for a while.
Nah, it was easy. They keep the Prozac right next to the catnip.

Ring the bell if you need me - and if that doesn't work,try one of the squeaky toys.  Or maybe the yarn.
I don't know Jerry, this seems like a bad idea. Not even the humans have successfully tamed that beast.
It's nice that cats can be service animals now, too.
All I can say is "Kittyup!"|
Just think of this as the GOP and me as Trump.
You said no to a motorcycle...
He's obviously compensating for something...
A little catnip in her vape pen and it’s off to the races.

She's perfect safe.  Just listen to that engine purr!

Once he was broken-in he's like a pussy cat.
Three sharp-eyed mice. One blinded cat. Let’s see how Brown’s wife does with these odds.
Dip the bit in catnip and he will put the bridle on himself.
There are two more blind ones...You should see how they run.
As long as the blinders keep him from seeing anything but Fox news, nothing can go wrong. And we get a tax cut."
Hello, laaaaaadies.
We're going to chase the farmer's wife.
Isn't this the cat's meow?
Really, the hardest part is getting the blinders on. After that it’s a breeze.
Off to the cat race.
Lucky for me, this is his fetish.
We're going on a cheese run. Any requests?
My cat whisperer course really paid off.
Whiskers knew the mice were taking advantage of him, but he couldn't shake his dream of running in the Kentucky Derby.
All he needed was a laser pointer.
I was going to train a dog, but I decided to challenge myself.
One of you stand behind the finish line, the other make sure the laser pointer is at the ready.
Sometimes you're the bug and sometimes you're the windshield.
I'm 3:1 in the third at Calico.
He's on anti-depressants.
He’s thinks this will get his picture in one of those stupid cat calendars.
Fluffy’s my bitch
The balance of power has shifted, friends! Are you in? Or are you out?
Since he's famous, Mickey just walks right up and grabs 'em.  When you're a star, they let you do it.
You say 'mixed-breed' - I say 'hybrid."
He likes my position on milk subsidies.
It works better when we aren't the blind ones.
Once you get to know him, he's just a big pussy cat.
Be careful, he can't see me, but he can see you...
When it's time for us to come back, just open a can of something.
He doesn’t know it so don’t tell him.
He really didn't have much choice once his nine lives were up.
It's fun, but he's eating me out of house and home.
Of course, the blinders work; I bought him from a Chihuahua.
Don't ask.  You know, 'What happens in Vegas...'
You ought to get yourself one too-  it purrs like a kitten.
If this is going to work you have to be as quiet as a...
If the blinders fall off  call 911 !
Great acceleration but a fuel hog.
They just need to be domesticated.
Hope nobody has a laser pointer handy
Mom!  Dad!  I trained him myself!
Just don't ask me what he eats.
This is my version of playing cat and mouse.
I promised him all of your hideouts.
Pussy whipped.
What he doesn't know doesn't hurt me.
Take it easy fellas, he's a vegetarian!
It's amazing what you can achieve with a little catnip.
Prey for me.
As long as the blinders don't fall off, I should be okay.
He's really a pussycat!
Kids today and their pimped rides.
Once you get enough catnip the rest is easy.
Don't worry—he's vegetarian.
It's like Uber, but it only takes you to your final destination.
You're okay as long as he doesn't see you
C'mon. We are "The Three Mouse-cat-eers."  Let's ride.
Come take a ride on the wild side
I know what you're thinking, but with Uber and Lyft jacking up their prices I'm willing to risk it.
It's all tone of voice. . .
In the land of blinders a mouse is king.
They’re not as hard to train as you might think.
He thinks we’re blind and and wants to level the playing field.”
First, I bought up all the catnip I could find...
What??  You've never seen a cat before?
I offered him 2 treats, some catnip, and a Xanax.
See?  I told you guys it's nurture, not nature.
I gotta get her tired enough so she can't chase me when I get off.
We’re going to visit the queen!
I let the cat out of the bag and here I am!
Blind leading the blind
Florida has to replace greyhound racing with something.
Who's the alpha now?
UBER and PETA settled out of court ... get on!
We're running in the Purreakness.
If they can't see the reigns, eventually they'll forget that they're not making their own choices.
Anyone wanna try? The catnip will wear off soon.
It's Mouser - like Uber but for mice.
I was getting tired of the three blind mice jokes.
He used to live in the White House, got out and applied for sanctuary, and will do anything to avoid being sent back.
What? I’m riding a cat.
Isn't this just the cat's meow?
I used to ride greyhounds but it just felt wrong.
You’ve been watching the wrong cat videos on YouTube.
I know it's not practical, but you only live once, right?
He's on a diet.
Shush! If he knew who is riding him, I’m toast.
I found her on Craigslist."
My secret? If you can dream it, you can do it! ... That, and catnip.“
Actually, it's a great job.... My only fears are (1) Uber switching to driverless cats and (2) his meds wearing off before my shift is over.
Now this is what I call the cat's meow."
Of course he’s stuffed! Best birthday present ever!
Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
Tell Mom I've run away to join the circus.
Wise up, guys. Alternative realities are all the rage.

It's a Domestic Shorthair without the bells and whistles.
Say what you will, it’s a pretty nice ride!
Beats scurrying!
The hardest part was training him to give me a leg up!
What? I found these in Sessions' office after he left. Guess he didn't need them anymore.
I call it three mice blinders
To London, of course, to see the queen.
If you think this is strange, you should check out the dog and pony games
He just ate the trainer and two barn hands so hopefully he's full.
Finally, Service Cat for Three Blind Mice
What's a matter? Cat got your tongue?
First, The Cats, then The Cheese, then...The World.
I got him from the Police Auction!
It’s reverse Darwinism
Who says cats can't be trained.
They call me the Calico Kid.
Just set your Uber settings to “vegan” and you’ll be fine.
Want to take a spin on my Mouserati?
He's stuck. I think he's catatonic.

Always remember to use an English saddle with a British Shorthair.
It's really all about how you raise them.
She wants to play with me before she kills and eats me.
Licorice...but you have to get the dose right.

All you have to do is download the app.
The real trick is knowing when she’s going to roll over on her back!
Look, in this day and age, you adapt.
You guys want to come over and watch me feed him?
See? Told you he was a pussy cat!
It's amazing, you just scream "Lock Her UP" and stoke their fears and they will blindly go against their own best interests to serve your power.
What she can't see won't hurt me.
Haven't you been watching the news?  All the rules are out the window.
Don't worry - it's domesticated.
Let's just say, curiosity got the best of this cat.
It's a trainer.  I'll be on an elephant in no time.
It is my turn to walk the cat today.
Karma
Three Blind Mice was only fake news!
Its largely about role playing!
He wanted a pony but his mom said no.

I can't wait to see the look on the faces of those cheese hogging rats.
I have him hooked on strong catnip.
I don’t know what you’re putting in her cat food, but don’t stop.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
The bell was too noisy.
He was just about to eat me, and we got to talking, and before we knew it, we realized that we both shared a keen interest in Equestrianism!

I am pleased to announce that Dopey will be leaving us to pursue a career as White House Chief of Staff.
To be honest, finding out that you're all gay is a bit of a relief.
Remember guys , when the prince comes you’re just my sisters kids.
Grouchy, you'll be Press Secretary, Dopey you'll be Attorney General...
Don't tell me.  Let me guess. Creepy is behind me.
So, which one of you is ‘Wealthy’?
I would prefer, "Hello, Snow White". Not "Hi, Ho"
This shot is for the USC application!  Pretend you know how to skate!
I am now Snow Caucasian and you are the seven little persons.
OK. 10 more minutes. Then off to work you go.
Yes, they do make you look taller!
Good news ! The boss called and you're all hired. The company is downsizing.
Is Gropey still in the Snow White House?

Unlike Sleeping Beauty, I'm not afraid of small pricks on spinning wheels
Well, this is a Grimm scene.
Oh, good - you're all here except Trumpy - that piece of shit.
Scene eliminated by censors for; exploiting  "people of short stature", rollerskating without helmets, woman showing too much cleavage, sexual innuendo of 7 men frolicking together, "Happy" leering at woman, all characters too "handsy"...
Amusing but what I said is that you guys needed to start dating
A day in the life of Nancy Pelosi.
Now that the mine is closing, I am training you for Amazon home delivery
I'd be a great referee for your roller derby; I'm the fairest of them all.
If you're Happy and you know it clap your hands.
Grumpy, you need to try these mushrooms that Happy just found!
"Really? All of you are running for the Democratic presidential nomination?
Hi to all of you too, but stop calling me "ho".
C'mon Grumpy... Jazz hands, Jazz hands!
Grumpy, when it's your birthday we'll stay home and complain about the weather.
Against all odds, Coach White and her team advance to the roller derby world finals in what many are calling a true Cinderella story.
She relied on a spellchecker and, instead of a seven-foot-tall nice man, she got seven foot-tall ice men.
I mean, it's not like mining jobs are ever coming back.
We don't use that term anymore. You are persons of special stature.
Hi guys!  I'm Snow White's sister, Off White!
Ha ha! I fooled all of you, i'm olive oyl!
Workplace morale hasn't been this high since we introduced whistling.
The caption contest will be over before Disney's attorneys can get the "Cease and Desist" letter to me.

He might not be Prince Charming, but his minivan holds 9.
So you ALL got jobs at the Amazon warehouse?!
Come on, Grumpy, jazz hands!
What the hell was in that apple!
Everyone be careful! Doc never went to medical school.
Let’s keep Clumsy in our prayers.
Quit skating around the issue, your mining jobs aren’t coming back.
I told you to get ONE pair of roller skates, size SEVEN!
When you greet me, please don’t keep saying, ‘hi, ho’.
Don't worry, you'll only have to see him every other weekend...and I got to keep the castle!"
Who will survive this weeks game of gnomes?
Why yes, they do make you look taller.

Let's see the von Trapps beat this!
Can anyone explain why I’m missing seven adderall?
Which of you is the acting Secretary of Education and which is Interior?
Thanks for understanding that "Snow White on Ice" sounded a bit too morbid.
I said "lets go to the Royal Ball",not Rollerball
I fired Gropey.
Jazz hands boys !
I  am so pleased to see you all have decided to correct the old campaign slogan to Make America Skate Again.
Grumpy wins! I didn't say 'Simon says'.
I promise you.  This is your ticket out of the mines.
"Ok, when we get to the border, make sure to say you're applying for political asylum and not a work visa for Disneyland."
Due to Climate Change, Disney on Ice had to make some sacrifices.
We can finally say you’re gay instead of Happy.
Roller skating on grass, let me guess......Dopey’s idea?
This'll give us the edge over Frozen
I appreciate the interest guys, but size matters.
Ok, time for Mommy to look for Drinky!
'We're late, we're late, so off to work we skate'.
Hey, guys, let's call our band Snow and the Rolling Gnomes.
Of course I’m qualified to judge; I’m the fairest of them all.
Well, with names like yours, you could all be candidates for the 2020 election.
You really nailed that short program!
They DO make you look taller!
Someday my skates will come.
Grumpy, can’t you do jazz hands with us just once?!
They were on sale at Fairest of the Mall.
Geppetto and I are having a relationship, but there are no strings attached.
C’mon Grumpy, we need jazz hands!
I got you all jobs at Amazon!
I'm glad you're all happy but now I can't tell who's who
...and it's going to be called "Game of Dwarfs" ...
Sorry, Boys, I'm looking for a high roller.
All I did was ask who you thought was the fairest of them all and I'm starting to feel like you're all skating around the question...
You traded the diamond mine for magic what?
Okay, who's going to tell me what Doc meant by 'rhinoplasty?'
I know, but when I find Prince Charming you're going to need some marketable skill.
Would it be an aggressive act of cultural appropriation for an unwoke cisgendered white woman to join you seven other-enabled individuals in recreation?
We start with roller disco then work up to Disney on Ice.
Good news! Goldilocks, Little Red Riding Hood AND two out of the three little pigs are out! We could take this!
Jazz hands, Grumpy...  Show me your jazz hands!
Guess who's pregnant again.
Disney on Ice felt a lot more magical before global warming.
I know you all will miss Clumsy and Risky, but I'm glad the remaining seven of you like your new skates.
Al Together Now! Papa was a rolling gnome...
It's a place called Disney something and they've offered us a job.
I see someone is still Grumpy
Oh, Trumpy, why can't you play well with others?
This season, on The Bachelorette.
That’s the best part about a sequel! None of this has to make sense.
I don't care if the sex tape gets leaked, that was awesome!
Like it or not, Grumpy, this is how we roll.
Come on,Grumpy,everybody else is doing jazz hands.
Who has the apple, we are almost at the White House!
OK, now skate AND whistle.
Good news. We can go home. Donald has made America white again.
Yes, you do look much taller.
I take one  little nap and inline skates are back in vogue?
Come on grumpy, show me the jazz hands.
Someone’s not doing their jazz hands...
Quickly now! All of you hide under my skirt, and when the prince arrives, we'll give him the scare of his life.
First one back to the cottage gets a Happy ending.
The White House called.
He wants you all to be in his Cabinet!
Wait! You're all running for President??
This, but on ICE!
No, Grumpy, Damnit!  Jazz Hands!  JAZZ HANDS!
No, no no! I said "online dating" not "inline skating."
Remember Clumsy’s last words: watch this!”
Disco while you work...
And you won't ever have to go back to the mines if you can do it while carrying a food tray over your head.
This and climate change are why I don’t want children.
C'mon, Grumpy, let me see your jazz hands
Are we ready for Disney on Pavement?
Ok, recess is over. Back to the mines.
I asked for a password with eight characters
But...you call each other that!
You're all skating in circles.  Are you politicians?
Now remember children, 
when the prince comes, I'm your skate coach, not your mother.
Oh, I'm ok for now. Someday my skates will come.
I'm actually Olive Oil.  I have always wanted to be a princess.
I know you guys wanted Hamilton, but Starlight Express was much more in our budget.
Careful!  Careful!  Remember, there used to be eight little dwarfs.
I think I took too many mushrooms.
Do you remember when Bob Mankoff was the cartoon editor and bought funny cartoons ?
Snow White and the Seventies Dwarfs
As referee, I'll be the fairest one of all.
Good news, Dopey. The President is nominating you for the board of the Fed !
Let's skate along the edge of the murky Forest of Copyright Infringement!
Grumpy, you've been traded.
I’m telling you! The evil queen is never going to see this coming!
If you don't get those hands out it's Elf on the Shelf for you, buster!
So I was like, I don't care if you brought me back to life. I made plans with my friends.
Grumpy ... once more ... Jazz Hands, Jazz Hands!
That's it!  The next guy who says "Hi Ho!" to me is going down.
Nothing feels better than rolling a seven!
I'm pregnant!
Speaking of rolling, guess what Mr. Disney's doing right now.
Seven dwarves in a roller derby... How can we NOT get a reality show out of this??
Doc, stay close...we might need you.
Which one of you unfriended me?
Grumpy is retiring, he will be replaced by Snitty.
Trump in drag with his cabinet.
Look everyone, Grumpy was almost enjoying himself for a second.
Which of you is the dwarf formerly known as Prince?
You guys are going to dwarf the competition!
Maybe changing your names would be a more effective way to break out of the stereotypes?
I'm in the wrong story. Where's Popeye?
You're late! You're late! So it's off to work you skate!!
This week on the bachelorette...
Wait, where's Grabby?
Not quite the high rollers you wanted to be, eh?
Jared, Ivanka, Donnie, Eric, and all the rest -- you may be skating now but wait 'til New York's Second District weighs in.
At first I thought it was weird that you all lived together, but now I totally get it!
Just five more minutes then I have to go to sleep.
And when we get to the Border...
Okay Biden. Get in line like everyone else.
I  used to be Snow White, but I drifted...
I'm really craving an apple
So, you whistle, I'll hum.  That's fair.  I try to be fair.  You know, they say I'm the fairest one of all.
Be open minded. 'Cats' ran on Broadway for ever.
Oh my! It’s the Trump administration’s Department of Transportation!
Let's go visit Clumsy in the hospital.
Actually, you all seem pretty dopey.
Those Keebler elves are in for a big surprise.
Looks like everybody is here except Trumpy.
So, Six for Happy Meals?
If you don't participate, it's just as easy to make it Snow White and the 6 dwarfs.
If you can think of an easier way to evade Disney's lawyers, I'd love to hear it!
One of these is not like the other
Okay, now try to whistle
For the big finish,  I’ll jump, and you’ll catch me.
I'm telling you, if we did this on ice we could sell tickets!
Grumpy, jazz hands!
So the plan is we’re going to roll in there, break her mirror, and steal all the apples.
Seriously? You're Grumpy even when roller skating?
Do you have to whistle while you skate too?
You DO look taller.
After I marry the Prince, I promise to put all of you on my health insurance policy.
I know Roller Derby can be linked to cuts and bruising, sprained and broken bones, torn ligaments, jeering fans, cheating opponents, and dubious officiating. But do you know what it DOESN'T have? Black Lung!
And a woman has volunteered to sell apples at every one of our shows!
By the way, Doc isn't a real doctor, so don't fall for his 'Please disrobe' trick.
Surprise. I'm really Pinnochio in drag.
Com'on, Grumpy. Show me that you washed your hands like everyone else.
We’ve agreed that Bernie is going to be grumpy. Who wants to be happy?”
Cinderella booked all the ice time.
Okay, i'm glad he gave you skates, but was he … um … charming?
You  guys should focus on this and forget all about the basketball team.
Enjoy yourselves today fellas, because come Monday it’s hi ho and off to work you go.
If you think it's fun now, just wait until you try doing it while you work!
Okay, which one of you is "Horny?"
As it turns out, it's not a coincidence we have the same nose.
Just roll with it, Grumpy.
In this fairy tale we are all gonna start working at Amazon.
Finally! A way to satisfy seven men at once.
Roller derby against Santa's elves is a big deal guys. Remember, they play dirty.
If I smile more, can I count on the short white male vote?
OK, who wants to announce for President next?
The winner is the next Atty. General !
Come on, boys, I mean it! Off to work you go.
Alright guys, twenty minutes is up! Back to the mine!
Very good - but Grumpy, we need more jazz hands!
I think "Bay City Bombers" is way cooler than "The Seven Dwarfs".
Oh, and there's a really, really good reason we have the same nose.
...and I have a brand new key.
Sorry, guys. It's not how I roll.
Are we ready for One Day Shipping?
Snow White on Ice: The Global Warming Version
Grumpy often wished that Snow White would stop Googling, ‘Fun activities for minors.’
But you can't ALL run for president.
Special brownies! We love special brownies!
Who let my dwarves out, who - who - who-who?
. . .and then Prince Charming said, "Wow, that's some schnoz you got there, Snow White."
You guys are going to crush the Munchkins in roller derby.
Great new guys! I really stuck it to Disney. We got lifetime residuals, 2 1/2 points of future features and 30% on all merch!
OK, we've got the theme, now all we need is a good story.
I don't know what the Hell was in that apple but holy crap!
Shouldn't you be off to work?
The Prince says you guys creep him out, so you can't come to the castle, but let's follow each other on Facebook and Twitter.
That looks a little too risky for me. I'll just go snack on an apple.
Can we all stop saying 'hi ho' , he kissed me while I was asleep
Her nose grew when she re-named them Healthy, Wealthy,Wise, Charming, Clever, Strong and Speedy.
Jazz hands, Grumpy! Fingers of joy!
You guys looked so much taller in your photo on the dating website!
Disney on Ice has been done. But Disney on Grass...it will be huge!
Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey ... Hey, where is Grabby?
Jazz hands, people, jazz hands!
Grumpy, nobody knows the rules of roller derby, so I don't think anyone is cheating.
You can't wake me up and not let me try!
Has anyone seen Gropey?
Weren't you listening? I said it was 'Disney on Ice'.
How can you still be grumpy?
You've all been granted Green Cards
Free Range Dwarfs!
Grumpy, Dopey, where is Sneaky?
See guys, there are fun things to do beside cocaine!
Be careful -- the seven helmets haven't been delivered yet.
...and if we win we get to have burgers and fries at the White House!
We're ready to take on the Keebler elves in roller derby!
This was Dopey's idea, right?
Snow White meets the cheapskates.
If I got equal pay, we could do a figure eight.
Look, I know at least ONE of you is happy about this.
Looking good everybody. We're going to crush Cinderella's team at roller derby this week!
They’ll knock about twenty minutes off your commute!
If this doesn't cheer you up, Grumpy, just to hell with you.
I know, but CNN says it’s not a witch hunt.
Now all together, "Ooh see that girl, Watch that scene, Dig in the Dancing Queen..."
And he told me that he was kissing me while I was sleeping just to save my life!
There, there, Grumpy.  Why so Grimm?
I just discovered I'm not a giant.
Fellas!
I've been offered a part in Game of Thrones.
I'm leaving.
Let me get this straight. You are Oakley, Brody, Wylie, Dudley, Reefer, Keefer and Bro?
See? Isn’t this better than getting a silly pay increase?
...and there was a guy on Craigslist selling 7 pairs!
No, Happy, my face is up here!
Whoa!  What was in that apple???
Are you guys out of your mines!
Okay guys listen up! you're all now officially Little People.
Trippy, Fally, Spilly, Ouchy, Hurty, Weepy - and Doc.
And then you'll all debate each other on the same stage!
Since I`m the fairest in the land, I have  decided to enter the Democratic primary and you will all get cabinet positions.
Joe Biden?  Where?
Yes I'm the fairest of them all, but I still need to see your papers.
You just wait until your fathers get home.
After Snow White goes off to marry the Prince, her younger sister Schnozola White comes to the rescue of the poor, abandoned, Seven Little Dwarfs.
Okay now, have we all signed our liability waivers?
I see a spin-off opportunity here.
Isn't this much better than the whole 'off to work we go' thing?"
The Queen is cool now... Doc botched my nose job.
See? No one can be sleepy or grumpy with roller skates on!
Ok Grumpy, now let’s see your jazz hands
For a change today, we’re off to see the wizard
Now if you all group up in a triangle, I’ll get the bowling ball
I'm glad you boys have found a hobby since they closed the mine.
The Seven Dwarfs on a roll.
This should help with your productivity. Now, off to work you go!
Who´s got one this big?
Finally, we can convince them that Disney on Concrete is viable
I'm so glad I'm awake for this.
Now, you may call me Coach White.  I want blockers over here, and jammers and pivots over there.
Which one of you gave me herpes?
Shouldn't all of you be hi-hoing it to work by now?
Hey, would you guys like to be in a movie?
1,2,3,4,5,6...Where's Sneaky?
No, I’m not Pinocchio, he’s my brother. Why do you ask?
I knew you would love hating this, Grumpy!
See, Grumpy, now everyone has a pair. They don't call me 'fairest of the land' for nothing.
I saw that smile, Grumpy!
Ok everyone, jazz hands!
Don’t give me that look, Grumpy, it’s actually called a ‘short program’.
You all have different fathers. Who's  the fairest in the land now?
Jazz hands!
Come on Grumpy, everyone likes jazz hands.
Well, gosh, now you all look dopey.
You are all so cute, I could just eat you up,and I will call you meals on wheels. "
Next you learn to Ice Skate and then advance to FROZEN!
The day Crashy and Burny didn't return to the castle.
Why yes, this was Dopey's idea. How could you tell?
Now let's see your figure sevens
Hi, I’m frumpy.
......and if you elect me, I will make sure to lower all the tables and chairs in the kingdom !!!
Huddle up.  We have a roller derby match with the Emerald City Munchkins.  Ready. Hi Ho!
And you thought whistling was fun.
I see no reason why you all shouldn't be Democratic primary contenders!
Now everyone, whistle while you twerk!
I know you like to “whistle while you work” but I am less fond of “farting while you skate.
Now, now that's enough--it's off to work you go!
How did you guys get my eBay password, and where are your pickaxes?
I kissed the wrong frog!
Yes, but can you skate AND whistle at the same time?
I was offered a job at Apple.
I don't know.  Why do you call him Gropey?
There now, doesn't that beat marching?
Good news, guys - I've found your skate key!
Things aren't as grim as they seem.
Guys, I forgot my glass skates....wait, what story is this?
Remember, no name-calling!
The Skaters ... Walt’s
But Grumpy, everybody loves jazz hands!
And now, jazz hands everyone!
Be careful. None of you want to be re-named "Injury."
In the last Roller Derby, you boys dwarfed the competition.
Snow White no longer heard complaints to walk slower because they have shorter legs and she lived happily ever after.
I can’t believe they had seven pairs in your size and not a single pair in mine!
Who wants growth hormone?
Roller skates?  What happened to Disney on Ice?!
And I also hate it when they repeatedly play 'It's a Small World After All'  over the loudspeaker.
Great, now you guys are seven times more annoying!
Snow white on ice, on a budget.
You realize, of course, that we are all on thin ice...
Remember, you're the only set of male septuplets in the world and I'm your Mom. If I can swing this network deal we'll be set for life.
Watch out you could be meals on wheels for the giant.
Jazz-hands", Grumpy
Do you think anyone has noticed we have the same nose?
Here's hoping this will dispel some of the awkward, sexual tension.
You guys not only rock - you roll!
If you can whistle, too, I'll call my agent.
No, the winner does not get to peek under my dress!
Skates never fit me. Of course, I'm no Cinderella!
You can skate around it as much as you want. I’m Snow White, not Sleeping Beauty.
You see? It's simply impossible to be Grumpy on roller skates!
Come on Grumpy, put both hands in and shake them all about.
Only one in seven dwarfs is happy!
That’s not what I meant when I said ‘Roll me one.’
Grumpy, jazz hands or it’s the old heigh-ho!
Good news - insurance will cover our nose jobs!
Trust me, this is all the rage in Middle Earth.
Keep practicing Grumpy... it’s Disney On Ice or we’re back in the Vault!
Doesn't skating around in circles like that make you feel Disney?
Without the DNA test , I never would have known I had siblings
Have you all been making weird videos for dwarves.com again?!
It's my treat for all of you beating the #*@! out of that man who kissed me when I was passed out.
We prefer the term "little people"
So what happened to ‘it’s off to work we go’?
OK, break's over. Back to the mines.
I'm excited also, but first we have to have a DNA test.
This is ridiculous. How can you still be grumpy?
Come on now. EVERYONE  has to do jazz hands!
Jazz hands! Our first Airbnb guest is here!
Are we ready to roll?
And by getting to work sooner, we will be able raise production goals.
Five more minutes, then back to the mines.
Pretty smooth moves for a bunch of octogenarians.
I knew those apples were laced with something.
It’s OK.  You can still whistle.
I got you all identical roller skates because I'm the fairest.
Because Disney owns ESPN, we can cross-sell your talent, and use the money to sue the Evil Queen.
Now remember to be careful everyone, Uncle Walt's family plan doesn't cover this sort of activity.
For example, *my* roller derby name is "Snow Fight"
Don’t worry. You’ll each get your chance to hide under my dress.
We’ve agreed on Grumpy Bernie and Sleepy Joe. Who wants to be Happy?”
Snow White and the seven micro-influencers.
Obviously none of you have been watching MSNBC except Grumpy.
Save for Grumpy, everyone's thrilled that I applied for that zero emission transportation grant.
You’ll work a lot faster once you get the hang of it.
Not exactly 'Disney on Ice', but not bad for a group of non-union, vertically-challenged gem miners.
That's great guys, but this is not how the story goes!
The paternity test came back and yes.. all of you are mine!
The app is working! There are seven of you less than a minute away!"
I just love how this keeps you from whistling!
I think I took too much of what Trippy gave me.
I’ll referee the match. I’m told I’m very fair.
Don’t be Bashful, Dopey.
People are saying living with 7 men who greet me with “hi-ho” is misogynistic.
When the Disney lawyers call my name is Pale Sleet.
not only do they give you mobility but a few extra inches never hurt!
I think I may have done the micro-dosing wrong
6 out of 7 dwarves are not Happy.
Sorry I slept in so long.  So it’s the weekend, is it?
Snow White  and the Seven Cheapskates
Enough fooling around.  It's off to work you go.
And after the skating, the Evil Queen has invited you all for candied apples.
And to think that the doctor told me I was going to have triplets!
After he kissed me, he told me he had just got out of a long term relationship and was only looking for somehing casual.
Now isn't this better than just whistling on your way to the mines?
I haven't been on a speed date before - do we take turns or all go at the same time?
Come on Grumpy, where are your jazz hands?
All you men are just alike. It was not THAT big.
Guess what?! I'm running for President!
Did anyone bring a snack? Maybe something healthy like an apple.
Doc, Medicare doesn’t cover rollerblading accidents.
Alright boys, from the top
Okay, then. Now skate your little asses over there and take the castle
Show me those jazz hands, Grumpy, or it’s back to the mines!
This is better than whistling while you work, right guys?
Wow, this from just a little nibble of the apple. I'm glad I didn't take a whole bite!
Ivanka White and her seven Roller Trolls.
Celebrate! Marijuana is legal now!
This would be so much better on ice.
I am now reminded why I never had children!
Have fun. But, just remember, we don’t have insurance.
I thought this was Disney on ice!
Forget about the wicked queen. It's fake news.
Next, let's try seven dwarfs a'swimming!
Disney on Ice...On a Budget.
I just have to look at your faces to know that Disney has had a stock split.
That's great. Now get back to to the whistling and the working.
Break’s over, back to the mines.
Remember what I've told you:  college is not for everyone, especially if your  counting on a skating scholarship.
Careful on the ice - don’t forget what happened to Clumsy.
Smile, or Disney HR will right-size your ass straight out the door.
This is lovely but I wished for one great seven foot prince.
Who wants to hide under my dress?
Tomorrow, I'll call you 'Achy' and 'Painful' and 'Sore' and . . .
Isn't this better than a silly old pay raise?
Sorry Grumpy but that's how we roll."
Who's Grumpy now?
Where is Trumpy?
OK, here’s the plan: We gain admittance to the castle as a novelty act, and once in the  throne room we assassinate the queen.
Alright everyone- you've had five minutes. BACK TO THE MINES!
So which one of you is the prince?
OK, now can you try whistling while you roller skate?
Same old trick. Six of you distract while one sneaks up behind me to cop a feel.
Grumpy, admit it. This beats working in the mine!
Has anyone seen Risky?
Did I mention you're all independent contractors now?
The lesser-known Disney on Rollerskates reviewed poorly, critics stated "without the ice it is just dwarves rolling around"
Good news! The plastic surgeon will give us a group rate!
And here I thought living with seven little guys couldn't get any weirder, you break out the in-line skates!
You fellows are doing quite well for only three wheels per skate!
Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, our roller skating show!
It beats confines of darkened mines, Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho-Hi-Ho!
You are all fair skaters, but I am the fairest.
So we sell the mine and grab that offer from Six Flags!
and tomorrow we are going to play mini-golf
Grumpy, mining is a dead end career path!
Trust me, the future is Dwarf Derby.
Go High-Ho Rollers!
Stop celebrating that you temporarily lost your coal mining jobs!! Trump will  save you!!
It was at that moment, Snow White's edible finally kicked in.
I guess you guys race short track.
So everyone skates in a circle and the last one to fall gets to be the Presidential Candidate!
Everything about this scares me.
The one in the rear is definitely not Bashful
Actually, I'm Olive, just filling in for Snow.
Faster!  The object is to confuse the hell out of her when she does that mirror thing.
It was a great deal. Pay for six and get the seventh pair free.
Who's a Democrat who wants to run for president?"
Keep practicing, m’lads. If we pull this off, the name Lady Gaga will echo through the ages.
Okay! Okay! Midget Football might have flopped but dwarf roller derby could be the next big thing.
Who wants to be president?
C'mon, Grumpy, show us your best jazz hands.
Alright, which one of you little shits took my phone?
Snack time! Who wants apples?
Just be thankful I didn't choose curling.
How the fuck are you roller skating on snow?
You are correct, Pinocchio was my father.
Great news!  They green lighted ‘Disney on Asphalt’!
Great news! Doc says Sleepy has been cleared from his last concussion and can skate again!
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the luckiest personal injury lawyer of all?
Safety Regs?  With this labor Secretary? Those waivers were preapproved.
Yeah, but your center of gravity is way lower...
This will make you whistle again while you work.
Grumpy I swear to God if you don't stop complaining I will beat your ass
Slip Sliding Along" is not your song. Now off to work you go.
So where is this Gropey you sang of?
You said, "Watch out for Trumpy?"

I'm telling you it was this big and I'm now much more a High Ho than Snow White, if you get my drift.

So, the remake is to be called "Snow but no ice."

You see, you get around faster. Plus you added 3 inches to your height.
Who's up for a healthy snack and a nap?
The song is not as catchy if we change it to "Whistle while you roll and fall."

That's new, I thought you whistled to work.
Hi ho! The Amazon drones have arrived!
Happy, live up to your name, dear.
And remember, NEVER let stumpy get behind you!
OK, boys, let's see those Jazz Hands! I want to see some energy in those fingers!
Now try whistling while you skate.
Someone has squeaky wheels?
Yes, it's fun. But isn't mining for diamonds more fulfilling?
I preferred whistling.
Hey, there are only seven of you here. Where's Clumsy?
We're going to Disneyland for Spring Break!
O.K. guys, you convinced me--there's no need for a prince in this relationship.
And I made you each the cutest little silk hot pants for your roller derby premiere.
A lovely little old lady gave me a lovely big red apple about this big that I traded for seven cute little pairs of tiny roller skates and a lovely little bow for my lovely hair.
Now let's all learn to whistle!
You do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around!
OK, boys, I’ve booked us in Vegas next. Let’s practice:
“ Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, on roller blades we go...”
Delightful, but there was no mention of this in the four-page summary
Come on, Grumpy, do something captionable!
I’m the fairest of them all, except when I play roller derby.
For the last time, it's nap time . . . Hey, how about some nice apples?
I’ve scheduled all of us to get nose jobs, my treat!
No more up skirting for you boys
OK Grumpy, you've gotta work on those Jazz Hands.
Elbows always up in roller derby little ones! Do your best and crush the appetites outta those lazy, flat-footed, fool-of-a-Took hobbits!! And remember...THEY! SHALL! NOT! PASS!
Ok, we've trained for this and we're ready...we'll have 60 seconds in the Giant's treasure room...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Where the f*ck is Tonya?
No, no, no, it's called in-line skating for a reason!
I have an idea - let's build an oval wooden track,....."
Good luck storming the castle.
It's off to therapy we roll!
Next thing we do is look for a buffalo herd.
I wonder what was mixed in those apples.
Who's ready for a nice red apple and a nap?
No, Disney wants it on ice!
See, I promised you’d see the upside to the Green New Deal!
Try the jazz hands, Grumpy! They’ll break your fall.
It's great to finally see Grumpy coming out of his shell!
I don't see Gropey. Where is Gropey?
C’mon Grumpy jazz hands! The evil queen will never look for me on Broadway!
Who wants a roll in the hay?
Cheer up Grumpy, we'll go bowling next week.
Where is Handsy?
Now, just whistle while you skate! C’mon, Dopey, Hipster, Depressive, Pothead, Showoff, Klutzypants. ... Hey, where’s Grabby?
Between the legs. Remember, you have the advantage.
Why do we get drawn with such ugly noses?
... and when Cindy falls for the group-roller-hug, Grumpy grabs the glass slipper and we all meet back here.
Who wants to work on dwarf #8?
Now you are 2 inches taller
Perhaps a laxative, Grumpy.
And we didn't even use fertility drugs.
Which One of You is Nosey
Well you know, it's hard work and rewarding being a single mother
No hug again today, Grumpy?
...and when you're taller, you can all have yo-yo's!
For Pete's sake, Grumpy! Putting on miniature rollerblades didn't make you smile - I think you'll still be miserable with jazz-hands.
Anyone know what pre-nup means?
Great news, guys! We got the audition for live action Frozen.
Little people on roller skates! It's like a fairy tale!
Ah, all my little social media followers...
Oh, Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer and Vixen!
Comet, and Cupid, and Dunder and oops.
Uh-oh - what happened to Crashy?
Grumpy, I know you don’t believe me, but I swear Pinocchio had nothing to do with that spell!!
Great news! I've signed you all up for the climactic Game of Thrones battle!
OK,my little Dem's,please line up for the debate!
While she talked, the dwarves politely nodded.  They then went right back to roller skating.
I love it! Dwarf roller derby is so much more dignified than tossing!
Great news! Disney green lit Dwarf Roller Derby!
...And your Derby Team Name will be "the White Walkers."
Hey guys, I've got an idea for a song! Start whistling!!
Good work guys! You're on a roll!
Snow White fulfills her dream of coaching her very own roller derby team.
Grumpy  where are your jazz hands ?
I'll be Sansa. Who wants to be Tyrion?
They said, “Hi Ho.” 
She said, “Hi” back.
Remember, only one of you will get to become "Rolley"
We are ready to rumble!
When we reverse global warming, you'll be able to ski again.
With a little more practice I will get you a spot on Disney’s Got Talent
Now if we form a line, we should roll up to the castle before my apple kicks in!
I'm going to be a naughty Princess now, you guys deserve this.
You guys forgot to take your Ritalin AGAIN???
That little fucker Dopey better not grab my ass again.
Shall we try it with some synchronizrd whistling.   This should end with a high production show stopper.
Grumpy show hands
Team, for home games, we wear white!
You're the 7 Dwarves, so why do I look like Olive Oyl?
Rather than "fairest" I thought I'd go for "fiercest".
And the good news is, kids skate free EVERY Saturday
Actually, I’d say you’re all Dopey.
Hey Dopey, where's Tardy?
Great news! The Studio green-lit "Snow White and the Seven Dorks.'
Snow White, are these small hands? He’s been talking about my hands, as if they were small. These are not small hands. I can guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee it.
Okay, who farted?
My stepmother never taught me how.
The Sequel:
Snow White and Dopey’s
Seven Little Kids
Don't worry, Bashful, Walt says doing jazz hands is just good, clean, American fun.
Sorry guys, they disqualified you from the limbo competition.
Anyone want an apple?
I warned you that your mining operations were like a poison apple to the environment.
How's my little grumpy trumpy today?
From now on, you are 'Little People' and we'll never use the 'D' word again. Nice skates.
I prefer Uber.
I can be the judge of your skating contest; besides, I'm the 'fairest of them all'.
Now you can all be happy!
If this is the world I live in, I wish I stayed in my coma.
Grumpy, I know ‘this is the 80’s and you’re down with the ladies’.
Sorry, I want to be with other millennials in an urban setting.
No way you’re still grumpy.
I'm sure you'd rather be a Jammer, but Blockers are just naturally grumpy, Grumpy
It was obvious to Snow White that Happy won the activity coin toss.
Okay! When he gets here...act casual!!!!
So now you're all Happy!
I see you've all become heigh ho-ly rollers.
No one is going to believe this.  You all need to stay still so I can get a photo for Instagram.
You're all  wrong. Some day my Prince will come THIS much!
Okay, you little creeps, now go throughout the kingdom and find me a Prince!
We might all be related. Who nose?
In spite of their small shoes, Snow White asked the Seven Dwarves to reduce their carbon footprints
If Jamaica made it to Winter Olympics 1998, Trump won 2016, let's think Tokyo 2020!
Let's get jiggy, boys.
Excellent-now you can do the work of 14 dwarves.
I’m so glad I woke up before the end of the ‘70s!
I know, let’s play a game where I’m a princess and you go off to work. Ho ho!
Enough Boys!, Hi, Ho - it's off to work you go!
Me too. Me too
Hey guys! My name is Snow, and I'm your new Roller Derby coach.
‘Don’t be hating when your skating’, Grumpy.
This is no Fairy Tale!  You're all registered for Roller Kingdom.  Load up the mini-mini van.
Alright, let’s roll.
I heard you taking about  cheapskates  and me  so I  bought  them for you .
Thank you for following protocol.
Good morning my pretties … just kidding
Don’t be bashful, enjoy yourelves! Well except you, bashful. You can be you
What type of song SHOULD we sing, Grumpy?
Your combined talent dwarfs the competition.
I promise electric scooters for next Christmas, okay...?
And which one of you is Bashful?
Has anyone seen Handsy?
It's really OK to whistle while you skate.
Now YOU can bring me Meals on Wheels!
If we want to compete with those 21. century Disney movies we need to step up our game!
It's working...I see Walt's face.
Let's show Queen Elsa what we've got.
Sure, you’ve got some sick moves. But I feel slightly like you’re stealing my spotlight.
I just said “It’s crazy it took Marvel 12 years to make a woman-led superhero movie” to myself, alone in this acre-wide field, and a bunch of you rollerskated in singing “Triggered much?” and I have to say I love it, it’s great and very fun.
Last one to the castle eats the poison apple!
Skaters gonna Skate
You guys are really getting better. Now, let's try it on ice.
Fair's fair
Come on Grumpy...Happy was right.
Tomorrow, Sunrise Yoga!
It’s really the same thing except for the whole climate change thing.
There... now will you stop that confounded whistling?
I'll say 'Go,' and the winner gets a shovel AND a pick!"
I'm sure that after he sees our version of Starlight Express, Andrew Lloyd Webber will finally agree to write a musical version of Snow White.
Enough work, already!  Let's whistle while we skate!
I know where we can get a disco ball!
Let's get the band back together!  With a name that's socially acceptable.
This was recess. Now it's back to Hi Ho, Hi Ho for you...
We'll show those tap dancing penguins who's boss!
Ms. White, may I join your group? 'Seven dwarfs' has a nice ring to it.
“I hope you fall on your ass, Grumpy.”
Yes I guarantee your co-workers will find this less annoying than whistling while you work.
C’mere guys, I’ve GOT to read you this story I just found in an old fairytale book that you NOT gonna BELIEVE!
What happened to Clumsy?
Grumpy, it’s called the 'hokey pokey.' It's a Happy dance. Don't be Bashful.
Okay, now whistle while you... Grumpy! don't forget the jazz hands!
Stop pretending, you're 65.
I know it was terrible musical but we’re ready for a “Starlight Express” revival!
With global warming, the seven dwarf switched from ice skates to rollerblades.
You are on a roll!
The commute to the mine will be faster.
I never intended us to be famous, it was Walt’s idea.
Spoiler Alert:  One of you gets impeached.
There! Now you guys don't look like a bunch of idiots.
Your're doing great! Has anyone seen Clumsy?
Let's whistle while we roll.
Let's take it again from the top.  Get in line and this time sing "Heigh Ho, it's off to work we go" with more feeling.
These Disney remakes are getting stranger and stranger
Do you have a pair for me in XXXL?
I can't get "Boogie Oogie Oogie out of my head".
Snow White and her West Wing cabinet.
The synchronized skating is great, but how about if you try whistling?

Your derby championship is tomorrow versus the Oompa Loompas.
This will be my first time babysitting for septuplets.

Little people can still question those in power
Let's go guys, it's off to work you roll.
Smile Grumpy,
Some day your Dream will Come....
Day 73 with the girl:
Another perfect day.  Two hours skating around the castle, and then lunch in the park.  Nearly smiled.  Must...not...crack.

 - Grumpy
Just when I thought you little guys couldn’t get any cuter.
Is she tall, or are we just short?
Now, Grumpy, let's remember to whistle while you triple lutz.
I'm thinking bigger; I'm thinking lights and music and yes! Ice skates!  Perfect!
Winter is coming, Snow White
I don't hear any singing...
Heigh-Ho Heigh-Ho, it's off to work we Roll
Your cute, but Seven Dwarves a' skating doesn't quite cut it...
Great job, but remember, the real show is on ice.
Oh my.... it's a group of disgruntled Sonic employees
Such a great thrift store day.
I am glad you like the skates because I traded the cottage for them.
You look ready for the lift—don't be Bashful!
Great, now I won't have to find some horses for the carriage.
They promised me a hoverboard for the remake.
I'm just glad I could get you all children's price tickets
You walked, I was blonde....that was before.
Limbo or conga line?
We have news!  There will be another little guy to skate around with you in seven months or so!
Just because there're 7 of you doesn't mean I'm Snow White.
I've told you guys before I'm not related to White Boy Rick.
I just can't decide! Do I wanna feel Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, or Dopey?
Wait wait, don't tell me. Doc, Grumpy Sleepy, Donald....oh darn!
OMG! No one's even gonna remember Elsa's stupid talking snowman once I post this!
How cute! I guess they'll call me Slow White now.
Let’s go find the prince and tickle him until he cries.
Note to self. Change withholding to single-7.
Turns out that unless I was asleep, that perv wasn't interested.
It sure beats a pay raise, doesn't it?!?
See? It feels good to unionize
Roll with it, Grumpy!
Now you can get to the mine faster and get me more gems!
I thought I ordered glass slippers, but enjoy.
Thank God it's Friday!
Look, this isn't "Frozen" and there is no ice
I knew you guys would love my new wellness incentive program.
Remember to whistle while you skate!
Fellas, my life is saturated with psycho-poetic metaphor, and I can't help but suspect that the roller skates mean my Prince will buy me a Porsche.
Don't have too much fun, these are rentals.
Just roll with it
Yes . . . you’re correct - there IS no height requirement - but I AM NOT going to endorse ANY of you for the democratic primaries!!
I've never seen you so grumpy, Happy.....I mean happy, Grumpy.
This will make a great sequel!
And what else did your new tech company give you?
I going to have a baby!
So, no more of that annoying whistling, OK?
OK, how about this one... The Dwarfs of Anarchy?
Now, which one of you is at sixes and sevens?
Anybody see a prince today?
May I roll with you guys for a few days?
So there’s this guy named Andrew Lloyd Weber...
Now you all look Dopey.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, Disney on ice paychecks let's go!
O.K., now let's show that evil queen you are hell-on-wheels!
Whistle while you twerk!
Not judging, but if I did, I would be the fairest of them all.
Wait! Let me get my leotards on!
Dwarves... Roll out!
Please stop. This is only slightly better than getting murdered.
Ok.....I was just informed that someone has X-Ray vision........
We cut our commute in half!
UNION.
Where's a poisoned apple when you need one?
We'll destroy those faeries in roller derby!!
I'm thinking this might work better on ice.
So you're telling me Andrew Lloyd Webber signed on?
Snow White and the Derby Dwarves
I know, I know, with the sun behind me you can see right through my skirt, Pervy.
Before we film, Walt told me he just wants you be yourselves.
It worked---the cocaine factory had been collectivized. The dwarves celebrated their implementing communism in the Alps by covering the mountains with the drug. Snow White, being the addict she was, was ecstatic to find an unlimited supply of it.
The scene moments before Snow White's fatal Instagram post that tipped off Maleficent.
Dear lord... Candidates PLEASE line up.
I’m glad to see Grumpy back, after the wheelie incident.
I think one theme is enough for our restaurants
Who gets tossed first?
I love this because I start taking normal human steps when we walk together.
Come now, Grumpy, admit it: Seven Dwarves Roller Derby is a much better second career than Disney on Ice!
Everybody rotate.
Do those come in adult sizes?!
Miners on skates... rock and roll!
Seven dwarfs ... seven days in a week.  Who needs Prince Charming!
If this doesn't change your attitude, Grumpy, then you're a lost cause.
It's lucky that they rent child sizes.
I said a short stroll, not a short roll!
I know you're all having fun, but we have to go now for your measles vaccine, one grumpy dwarf is enough"
Next stop- Disney on Ice!
Remember, it's Sleepy's turn to do the hip whip.
so much fun, yes? Now let's get back to that ol' whistling and working.  Keeping Snow happy ever after ain't cheap.
Don't y'all have to "heigh ho" it to the diamond mine?  Though I love a diversion, I have bad apples to eat, princes to meet, and queens to beat.
Okay. You got free style skating down. Tomorrow Disney will send over a choreographer.
I know it's 'Game of Thrones' last season, but this could get us into the final episode!
Next we transfer this to ice skating and I think we have a show
Walt's going to LOVE this!
You’re all just skating the issue. I will be announcing my candidacy in the morning!
And if you master this the Prince will arrange a meeting with the Royal Stilt Maker.
Tardy”, the 7th dwarf arrives late again
Tomorrow you'll have singing lessons and I get a nose job. We should be ready for a screen test.
And then we had no more ice so we had to switch to roller skates.
You're so much like children, I won't have to freeze my eggs after all.
'I'm not sure if Walt Disney's liability insurance covers rollerblading."
Disney Reboot: Snow White and the Skating Dwarfs
Oh come on...nobody is Grumpy when they're skating.
I feel a sneezey coming on!
Heigh Ho, how great, it's off to work we skate!
Come on guys. you all can't run for President!
Isn't it more fun to whistle while you skate?
Remember, whistle while you block your opponent in the roller derby rink!
With these, I don't have to wait for you every 10 yards anymore!
Hi ho hi ho
tis off to the mines you go,
the union contract says, you know,
you're only off on the weekends.
Disney is ok with you being gay Happy.
All right all right, It's off to work you go.
No broadway appearance if you don't swing.
Thankfully the skating competition groups are by height, not age.
It's roller skating, Grumpy, not roller hating.
The President has honored Sleepy by naming his opponent after him.
I want to see more jazz hands guys. Really sell that excitement!
These White House briefings are so much when the Staff gets involved. Maybe next week we can invite the Attorney General"
Every girl dreams of a guy that will smooch a random unconscious woman that they find in a coffin in the woods, but I never thought it would come true for me.

Those rollerblades look fresh by the way.
Now you can wheelie whistle while you work!
Heigh-Ho, Heigh-Ho, It's off to Venice Beach we go!
Okay guys, let's get smart.
Let's follow the yellow brick road!
Who says you can't teach an old dwarf new tricks!
I've dumped the prince.  Could you use a manager?
Looks fun, do you have any in my size?
Whistle while you work-out!
Day 1 of social media addiction class
Sorry guys. No more sticks and balls for roller hockey. They’re made in China and can’t be imported because of Trump’s trade sanctions. You’ll have to play roller disco instead.
Walt hates the idea, but the animation department loves it.
The first one to get to the castle gets to go apple-tasting with me!
I’m not sure this is covered by your workers comp!
See, elves, it's important to train in the off-season.
Forget about Snow White. I'm now ROLLER GIRL!
Alright, boys, union break’s over. Back to the mine.
Now, isn't this better than toiling in a cave whole day?
Instead of a poison apple,the mean Queen gave us disco.
Oh God! I'll never be able to remember your roller derby names!
It appears you all enjoyed the apple slices.
Now you don't have to run to keep up with my walk.
Great rollerblading guys.  You're ready to spread out and find me a prince or a knight ... a burly blacksmith would be fine too.
Don't take it personally.  It's just that I'm attracted to taller elves, that's all.
Oh, Grumpy... Don't be a skater hater.
Is he behind me again? Oh, hi seventh wheely.
Dance damn-it, hi-ho!
Line up so I can give you your growth hormone.
Cersei will never see this coming.
There's no way Cinderella and her silly mice are going to win now!
You can't be Grumpy rollerskating.

Okay, once more, from the top:  “Hi ho, hi ho...”
Guys, the Evil Queen is near - let's roll.
Okay gang, who wants ice cream?
I kissed a girl and I liked it.
Disney's new roller derby team, Snow Fight and the Seven Dwarves.
One of you will grow up to be a Trump
Sleepy and Sneezy, stay away from the cliff.
I'll put in a good word with them at the castle, just don't get your hopes up that synchronized rollerblading will become an Olympic sport.
Has anyone seen Donald?  He promised.
Great news from the Wicked Queen's administration. First, my problematic classification as the 'fairest in the land' has been reassessed. Second, infrastructure spending will include a roller rink.
Ooh. Look at my cool Grumpy. Hand behind your back!
Is anyone happy?
Everyone Happy?
Now,if we had that wall,you couldn't just skate in here all willy-nilly,free to do as you please,could ya?
I’d like to try it, but I’m afraid I might fall and hit my head and fall into a coma, only to be awakened much later by the kiss of a prince.
The first rule of roller derby is you can’t be Bashful.
Why can’t you be more like happy?
All righty then....time for the high jump contest
Fun time is over guys. Everyone back to work.  Oh and it's okay to whistle."
It's Sleepy's turn tonight.

I'm not saying I don't want to skate with you, it's just that this hole 'the queen asked a hunter to bring back my heart and liver to eat it' situation got me a little upset
I'm going to tickle that grump right out of you.
And then we do more cocaine!

Grumpy, it's either jazz hands or tickle-tickle-tickle.
Fantastic! Now, just for kicks, let's try one where you trade in your skates for mining tools and switch jazz hands to whistling.

Doc, did you forget to give Grumpy his Happy pill?
What I wouldn't give for a nice, long nap.
Instead of ice skating, let’ me talk to you about a new sport called roller derby!
Cmon, Dopey and Grumpy, arms out, arms out!

Is ‘Bashful’ a roller derby nickname?
I'm going to have to get you dwarves inline.
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Our work was all for show . . .
I can make you all stars.
Don’t let you their name get to you, The Seven Deadly Sins are just not that good a roller derby team.
Grumpy, Dopey, I'm very disappointed. I thought we had _all_ agreed to grow hipster beards?
With a bit more practice, we'll be able to beat the team from Frozen.
Someday my lutz will come.
I can’t hear any whistling
Hi ho, hi ho, let's roller skate on snow!
I'll just call you all "Skatey" from now on.

When it snows we'll go ice skating!
Can you whistle at the same time?
I’ll have a hamburger and fries.

Guys, I think I am starting to feel it
Group date falls just short of expectations.
This is not AT ALL what we talked about.
Ladies' choice!
It's called Disney on Ice. You'll be perfect for it!
God I’m ugly

Great idea! I really think the skates will put the "Heigh-Ho" number over the top!
Dopey, was it your idea to roller-skate on the grass?"
Yes, celebrate! We finally have a presidential candidate we can relate to.
Now you can be my advance team with the Wicked Witch.
Our shtick is whistling, not rollerblading!
Nobody can be grumpy on rollerblades!
Hi guys! Can you whistle,too?
Remember the choreography. High low, high low. Grumpy - show me those hands!
Rumpy made a grab for it.
I feel all these emotions, Period!
See boys, skating while you work really is the new whistling.
See guys! Cinderella was wrong, this is so much better than chasing after a ball.
Thing is, Disney On Ice is done on ice.
When you guys asked if I’d like to see Disney on Ice, this wasn’t what I was expecting.
We are Fam-i-ly!!!
Alright, which one of you has my JUUL?!
Am I dreaming?
You see? Now you're all Happy.
It would never work...trust me!
Remember, it's one foot on the second "ho" and the other on "go."
I don’t recall skates in the old animated version.
Smile, Grumpy, or you'll never make it to Rockefeller Center!
Yes I do feel Dopey,  why do you ask?
From now on fellas, it's "Hi-Ho on Wheels!"
I don't know why they left the skates out of the movie.
I said “I could use a DRINK !”
We'll make the big time yet boys. When I'm done training you, 
they'll change that song from seven swans a swimmin' 
to seven dwarfs a skatin'!
Excellent! Now all we need are some guns and ski masks.
After this I thought we’d bob for apples!
Ok, lets take it from the top, and a 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 and a 5 and a 6 and a 7
I hope none of you are named, "Clumsy."
I was thinking of starting a pint-sized roller derby team. Any takers?
Grumpy, you look so Trumpy.
Altogether now, start whistling.
Well, they didn't tell me to bring my skates!
No more NoDoz for you, Sleepy!
Nose White and the Seven Schnozolas.
Come on Grumpy - let's see your "spirit fingers"
Skates put an end to the inappropriate touching.
Ready for your new nicknames from Donald Trump?  Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy!
Speedy, Spinny, Whizzy, Whirly, Zippy, Breezy and ...  Grumpy.
'Gather 'round, boys. It"s time for the big vote on whether or not, I should get a nose job."
I have two words for you Grouchy: 'Roller Derby'
Grumpy!  Simon says, “ Wave your hands”....... like this.
Dopey... Grumpy... hey, has anyone seen Handsy?
Any ideas on how to adapt to climate change?
Some day my prince will come and we're going to kick his butt in roller derby.
An early rehearsal before the company settled on ice shows.
You put both hands in. You put both hands out. You put both hands in, and you shake 'em all about.
...Sleepy, Happy... oh no, who was the last to see Cuncussy?
Are you guys getting rich, Doc, or just skating by?
I heard from Disney: Good news and bad news. They want a higher concept than roller skates. But Snow White and the Seven Skateboarders is a go!
Just wait 'til  everyone at the ball sees us roll up on these in-line skates...
Now you can whistle on your way to work.
Roller Derby! I see it now. Snow White and the Seven Smashers!
This is not what I meant when I suggested rolling over your assets.
We're going to have a baby.
Heigh ho heigh ho its off to work we go with a bucket and spade and our rollerblades heigh ho heigh ho.
Skates were a great idea. No one would have believed us about flying monkeys.
Tomorrow, I'll teach you roller derby.
After Disney On Ice, the idea well kind of ran dry
So, I got eight tickets to Avengers Endgame!
This is fun. Later, we are going to get health insurance for everyone.
The final tryouts for Disney on Ice
I'd like to see a little more hip-checking on the part of Grumpy...
Statistically speaking, one of you will be physically abused by an intimate partner. And all of you will contract HPV.
So, for the roller derby, we're going to pick new names like 'Crusher' and 'Axe Man' and put on that game face we talked about...
Are you ready to rumble.?
After this we’ll play “Let’s storm that bitch at the castle!”
Now promise me you won't tell your mothers I let you skate under my dress.
I know you're good skaters, but none of you passed the height requirement to get in the skating rank without a chaperone.
That’s the fourth Rihanna song in a row.
Hey boys, I know you’re having fun but the gems won’t mine themselves
Hi I'm Snow's cousin Olive
I'm so happy that 6/7ths of you are enjoying your new skates!
...five, six...hey, where's Rolly?
Yes yes hi ho hi ho. Now off to work you roll.
Hi Ho, Hi Ho! It's off to skate you go!
Oh Grumpy, we get it...’jazz hands’ is just a step too far.
They never know which one of you is my dad
This ought to win back the Pixar audience.
Little did they know that Snow White's proposed exercise and entertainment regimen was actually part of a cruel plot training them to be the underpaid and overworked travelling cast of a children's ice-rink show.
Mirror mirror on the wall,whose the fastest of them all?
Don't go to far far away.
Surprise! We're going into the grocery delivery business!
Tighten the skating routine a little and the Disney Channel might be interested in us.
OK everyone, Disney On Ice is only one month away!
I preferred Disney on crack.
You can skate with us, but I wouldn't audition for Sleeping Beauty if I were you.
Act small. The TV sitcom people are almost here.
Hey guys, who's up for Roller Derby?
We NEED more of whatever was in that apple!
Now we need a little rink.
Stop following me !
Okay we had our fun, how bout we hi- ho, hi - ho off to work now.
Are you ready to rehearse our new group number, “Whistle While You Twerk” ?
What do you think, boys? “Snow White and the Rolling Dwarves.” I like it!
Come on, dwarves, why don't we paint the rink? And all that jazz
Don't forget, tomorrow it's right back to the mines!
That's enough of the  hi-ho,  hi-ho,  now it's off to work you go."
Okay, you can all stay out until 11. Now am I the fairest of them all?
I can't tell who's Dopey and who's Happy
Dopey, you were supposed to get ice skates.
If you think this is fun, tomorrow I've planned nose jobs for all of us !
Snow invited some of the other princesses, but her birthday party still turned into a mini-sausage fest.
If you think you're having fun now, wait until we pave over the forest!
Okay fellas...I give up.  Who took my skates?
and when we get this new concrete stuff, those wheels will actually roll you along
No, I didn't say you were all cheapskates...
I meant it was all that I could afford!
We're busy...let's keep this short
Hokey and Pokey got turned around, so we'll be a little late getting started."  
Bill Hight, Augusta, G
I have some good news Grumpy! The doctor gave me some medication for you.
Who is the fastest one of all?
More animated, boys. It’s a live show. We can’t fix it in post.
So the dwarfs went roller skating without safety helmets, and the Seven Dwarfs soon became the Three Dwarfs.
No way! Roller skating is still a thing?!
Next, you'll all want headphones.
OK, guys, it's time for SNOW shoes.
and you must be skatey!
Just dressing like a King does not give you the office!!
Now remember we have to practice for Mr Disney " it's a small world after all" and not " Heigh -ho
Thanks, Dopey, this totally makes up for being poisoned.
I don't expect ICE to come, but if they do you'll be ready.
Now they'll have to give us a sequel.
Anyone else down for a nap?
Now with the closing of the mine you have an opportunity to learn a practical skill, like roller derby!"
"What happened to Clueless?"
Clumsy? He's at the ER. Skating didn't go well for him.
... then our production of "Starlight Express" moves to Broadway. Now THAT'S a fairytale ending.
C’mon “Jazzy”, use your hands!
Not so fast, boys.  Since I'm the fairest, I still headline.
Never. Eat. The apple.
I think Hide and Seek works better for Dopey when the rest of you hide out in the open like this.
Snow White’s plans for Roller Derby Domination were nearly complete
Hey  HO !  MOVE IT
Hey Grumpy. Who's got the brand new key?
A dinky rink!
Yes. Yes. I know. Reunion expectations are rarely realized.
Sorry my sweets, but I just can’t keep all your pronouns straight.
Viagra let's get those guys up.
Hey guys, circle up!  It's time for the Hokey Pokey . . .
Despite her heritage, Snow White III never learned how to skate.
Give me some hi ho now and you'll get some later.
If you want to be a boy band, you'll need better choreography.
Hey guys, I got it! My roller derby nickname can be ‘Roll Miners’ Daughter!’
Waving hands are happy hands- that means you, Grumpy!
Forget the castle. Will you guys let me be Queen of the roller derby?
Now that the coal mine is tapped out, you’re all almost ready for your next career: car hops.
This is just like a fairy tale.
It's almost the end of the month so tomorrow, back in the mine! Yaayyyy!!!
Ice skating on top of Walt just seemed disrespectful.
Take that, oppressive patriarchy!
That magic apple was STRONG!
We'll call it 'Blood Diamond, the Musical.'
A magical attempt at more Instagram followers.
I realize not everyone will enjoy this.
A bit more practice and you'll be ready for skating with the stars
Look guys! I have a big nose too!
I just love it when you all rock’n roll!
''My ambition has awakened me! Only three more players for this land's first roller derby team!''
''Guess what? Netflix just called."
You've grasped the wheeling, now let's move to the dealing!
Okay, okay, that looks like fun but it's time to heigh-ho heigh-ho and go to work already -- Momma needs a new dress.
has anyone seen Patriarch-y?
I just got the call! Disney on Ice is suing us!
This will increase efficiency tenfold!
You dwarves are so damn stupid.
...it’s very strange indeed, we all have five fingers.
What did I tell you guys about leaving the yard?!
Okay, now let's try it naked.
Iger said for the live-action version we gotta make it jazzier than last time.
And if you kill the prince...kites.
Sleepy finally woke up!
Excellent. Let your emotions guide you.
Fifty bucks says you can’t name every Democrat who is running for President.
I feel like a Disco Queen
This is only the beginning. In winter it will be Disney On Ice!
And the mines are accessible on wheels right?
Dopey, Grumpy, Doc, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy...I think we should all thank Happy for planning this wonderful day!
I know y’all are dreaming of becoming a NBA player, but this is just as much fun!
And next weekend we can do a group spin class!
...and we'll call it...ROLLER DERBY!
Now I'm confused...which one of you is Skatey?
Okay, end of play time! Hiho hiho, it's off to work you go.
Disney's moving off the ice and into skates!
See Grumpy? Just because we live in a feudal society doesn't mean we have to feud
Snow White and the Seven Ubers
But for couple's skate, how will I choose?
Snowwhite calls out to her roller derby team: "Basher, Physcho, Thrasher, Angry, Crusher, Knockout, and Smashface"
Who took my apple?
The fairest one of all?  White wine.
Very funny, which one of you raided the Munckin's dressing room?
Is this Xanadu?
Who wants an apple?
You're not defined by who you were meant to be!
I'm not your mother!
Snow White and the Six Dwarfs' Derby Musical can happen! Grumpy, roller skate with jazz hands or die!
Wow! now you all speedy enough to follow me
I am counting on you
Roller skate therapy resulted in a fleeting grin from Grumpy.
I bought Apple the stock not the fruit.
Look out for Clumsy !
Come on Grumpy. We're doing this for you.
Disney On Ice has nothing against us.
If you whistle, it's deductible!
Grumpy brings hating to skating!
Who is the best gift giver of them all, huh?
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the FASTEST ones of all?
Done!  The queen backs off, and I agree to be your roller derby muscle.
I guess there never was a "Clumsy."
Ok boys. Time for apple snacks from the Queen!
Since I'm no longer the fairest ,we can start a franchise.
and now we  are going to deliver meals on wheels
I was okay with you guys whistling while you work but now you're just skating!
That's nice. But frankly, it's only this much fun for me.
At this rate we could make a cameo in Frozen 2!
On Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen.  Oh, sorry, wrong group.  Let's try again.
Look, you guys have saved my life numerous times. I taught you all how to rollerskate. Can we call ourselves even?
Our Roller Derby team name has to comply with the new standards. What do you think of "A Person of No Colour and Seven Vertically-Challenged Individuals"?
I could just put you all in a little pie!
Okay then, Snow White and the seven bad-ass skate dudes it is.
See Grumpy? Isn’t this much better than going to the well and wishing for it all to end?
Mr. Grumpy Skates, I need you to be more of a team player.
Great news, we got the reality show! I'll be called, Sister wife, and the seven the little people.
ready for the roll call
If we bring the jazz hands, then the audience will whistle for us.
Who got kissed and brought disco back?!
Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to work you roll, you'll get there quick.....
This was a better idea in theory.
So is it off to work you go or not?
Welcome to the opening rehearsal of “Snow White Express”!
Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it´s home from work we roll.
I love the 80s!
'But why do you call him Goose?'
Now off you go to your waiter jobs at Sonic ... and bring me back some apple slices
You're doing it! You're doing it! You're doing it! You're doing it! You're doing it! You're doing it! You're doing it! "
And remember, CHILDREN, no talking to the mining inspectors.
Be very careful, my little friends and don't get hurt.  I haven't been working in several years any my health insurance lapsed long ago.
Who plays the fairest of them all?
Excellent. Now the next step is training in assault operations.
#metoo
So if my stepmother comes, Doc, you're the jammer and, Grumpy, you give her a booty block into the crowd.
They’ll never guess I am sent by the mining company’s HR to take their mind off of their lung diseases...
Ok everyone, in and out, it's a smash and grab job."
Coal mining jobs are back. Off to work!
You're darn right you skate better than Tyrion.
Hey guys, I finally came up with a name for our roller derby team!
Finally, a Disney movie for the #metoo era.
Ohmygodyou’llneverbelievewhatmystepmomdidtome...
No no no! I clearly said, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ON ICE!
Great, but who is starting dinner?
I see Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, but where is Pinchy?
You guys are so 'Happy' - not a 'Bashful' or 'Sleepy' one in the mix!
Now Grumpy, we don't want to waste what the Night King left us.
No, I don’t think “Dancing with the Dwarfs” will work... let’s stick with “Little People’s Icecapdes” and see what the networks think...
naturally, dopey's the fastest
Some day my prince will roll in.
So next activity I've got 6 for mini-putt and 1 nap.
If you think these are fun, wait 'til I get you the ones with knives on the bottom!
'Sorry Snow but it's not our fault that you have big feet'
Not true, Grumpy. 'Jazz Hands' are fun for everyone!
Hurry,lets all go to the Plastic Surgeon for our nose jobs
7 men and not one brought me skates. Chivalry is dead.
Yes, the president has been impeached! Get over it Grumpy.
Democrats rolling for President.
Seriously, I want the evil queen at my wedding - I have a pair of red shoes that she will just die for.
Hi ho hi ho it's of to work you roll !
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, roller skating from work they go.
I prefer snow shoes."
Okay, Queen Grimhilde's roller derby team is gonna have their butts kicked, but where is our chief jammer sleazy?
I finally got hitched. His name is Pinocchio.
Time for our group hug!"  "Bashful...
Now do that on ice, and you'll never need to work again!
Are you going to change your name now that the climate's changed?
Has anyone seen Hokey Pokey?
And they said the Green New Deal wasn’t practical!
Don't forget to stop for bread on the way home
The prince is a big fan of jazz hands.
From now on, I can call you all "Clumsy."
This will really be something when someone invents disco music.
Ok troops, you’ll be lining up behind the Dothraki, don’t forget your swords....
Is this their idea of professional development?
Come on, guys. I know ONE of you is my father...just tell me who?!
Fairest of them all is not what it used to be.
Alright guys the group date is over! Let's head back to the castle for the rose ceremony.
And not only do we cut the expense of the ice, we can now perform the show year round!
Come on, Dopey ... use your jazz-hands!
I love that you whistle while you skate!
Good job!  Let's try Couples Only.
So, are you boys going to teach me how you roll?
On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer....(Sorry,wrong crew.)
Mr. Disney! His beard is gone!  Grumpy's off his antidepressants again.
Which one of you wants to be eaten first?
I can’t go roller skating, guys. Mr. Disney has me scheduled for a nose job this afternoon.
Guys,guys I said roller coaster!
Disney on Ice adapts to the times.
Keep this up and I'll have to change both my names.
I'm not off to work, and I'm not a "high Ho!"
Even though it's the Seven Skating Dwarfs Sequel, you all can't be Happy...
Trolling the Queen is a slippery slope.
Seven little boogie dwarves!
I'm glad you dwarves haven't soured on life because of your size and still know how to have fun!
This is confusing you all look Happy."
Nose white and the seven snorts
Grumpy, relax and enjoy!
Now that I have given you all roller skates go out there and find me the best plastic surgeon in New York who can give me a good nose job.
I said "razorblades" NOT "rollerblades"!
‘Disney on Ice’ has to get its start somewhere!
Why are you six?
There's a Sonic drive-in right next to the palace.
Your personalities dwarf your skating.
Disney will be pleased.  It's a good gimmick for a sequel.
Now no more whistling, okay?
♫ We rollin', Grumpy hatin'  ♫
I loved the ice too, but this way the margins are much better
Where's Licky?
Aha! I think I see which one of you little imps hid my stocking cap and skates!"
Just remember, cobblestone streets can be dicey!
Roller derby was never quite the same after they started the Cosplay League.
Just think of the disco ball as a bunch of tiny magic mirrors.
Um, Grumpy? Jazz hands, please.
That's it! You got it! Broadway, here we come!!!!!
Okay dwarves, since you have your skates on, let's skate on over to the White House and protest about family separations. I have enough tiny signs for each of you.
I was crippled by anxiety - and then : poof! Midget spinners are such a boon.
Once we move this to ice, we'll make a fortune!
You'll be thrilled to know I'll be announcing a friends with benefits plan if we win our lawsuit against Disney.
If we move in together, we are totally getting our own reality TV show!
Very nice to meet you all!  Now, which one said his name is Horny?
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, to roller derby we go.
Excellent practice, I’ll tell coach Grimm.
hello seven small people”
They may be vertically challenged but they’re vertically mobile.
Last one to the castle gets beheaded
Our miner league roller derby team is gonna be huge!
Greater mobility for the working class creates more fairness in the land.
She may be clever, but the Wicked Queen is no match for our enchanted roller derby team.
I know. "Disney on Ice." What the hell does that even mean? Here's the weird part. The ghost was frozen when he said it.
You're slippery little bastards, aren't ye?
Enough playtime! Everyone back to the diamond mine.
Look, it's the roller derby for the democratic presidential candidates
How can you still be Grumpy while you’re having fun?
So...we got the job on Little People Game of Thrones 
Summer is coming…
No, no, silly boy-my name is Snow White, not Frumpy.
It’s easier than herding cats
Eight was too many and we are better off without Pervy.
Which one of you stole my roller blades?
Something must be right. Even Grumpy's smiling!
Come on, Grumpy. Admit you're having fun rollerskating on the grass too.
So, in this new concept of the story, my Prince Charming will be a fish riding a bicycle and the evil Queen will be Donald Trump.
Ok, let’s play a game. Let’s see how far I can toss you?
Hi ho Hi ho - where did Grumpy go?
Unfortunately, the new Disney on Ice show was promptly shut down for ignoring child labor laws.
O.K.  Who has the hankie?
I have good news...I am pregnant again and this one we will name drunky.
You guys look great, but Grumpy at a roller derby sounds like a bad idea...
Where can I get a pair?
STOP CALLING US "LITTLE PEOPLE." WE'RE MEN GODDAMMIT!
And off to work you roll
You're all Happy now.
You can please most of the dwarfs all the time
Which one of you is the doctor?
Well, what a coincidence, I'm from Southern California too.
Good news! Limbo skate is next!!
Don't be so grumpy, Bernie.  You made the final seven....in the year of the Woman!!
Have you seen my friends? They look just like you,but without the skates.
Wow!  Great skating.  Let's see if you can all whistle at the same time.  We might make it big on America's Got Talent!
Dang it dopey, I said I wanted Real love, not Wheel love!
Has anyone seen Slippy?
As Speaker of the House, I am totally against you all running for president!
Whoever knocks the evil queen down first gets a non-poisoned apple.
The Border Patrol is busy rounding up a sled full of elves so let’s get ready to skate across!”
Sorry guys,but I  just don't think America's Got Talent will find it worthy.
First one back to the cottage gets a juicy red apple!
And the first one to the castle gets the magic apple!
Hi ho.  Hi ho.  Off to work the 6 of you skate.  Doc and I will ambush the Queen.
No, not dwarfs.  That'll never work  .  .  .  I got it!  We'll be Snow White and the Seven Skates!
Beats driving a taxi in rush hour traffic!
Oh me, oh my, I won’t be able to outrun any of you!
Smile and show your beautiful fingers! Here at the Awkward Hands Meet-up Group, we don't have to be shamed by our phobia of touching our fingers together.
Come along lovelies, we're going to thr White House to join the others.
Charming! That's what it's all about.
No need for introductions, our names define who we are
I guess we're all a little nosey
I think we're ready for Walt's defrosting.
I thought you'd like to play while you work,too.
Guess what, guys, we got that gig on The Tonight Show!
That's not exactly what I meant by rinky dink.
Don’t be mad, she will bring more apples!
You guys gotta keep it down, I need my beauty sleep.
Since there are too many of you to carpool,  I hope these in-line skates will solve the problem of getting to work.
How do you like them apples?
Ok boys, what’s our roller derby name?
What  could be more adorable than seven singing and dancing dwarfs on rollerblades.
Skating around in a circle is Dopey - that’s funny, Doc!
Synchronized skating is harder than it looks.
Are we in the wrong fairytale? My tits are 'Frozen'!
I am so glad you are all here for my coming out party!
You guys have finally gone viral.
OK guys who has the growth hormone?
I knew I'd get you guys inline someday.
Grumpy you're not kids  
you're 80 year old little people that never grew
I'm sorry guys,  I distinctly told them ice skates.
For fuck's sake, could you stand still? I'm trying to talk here!
He was a skater boy. She said, "See you later boy." He wasn't good enough for her.
Dwarves on Ice! No more mining for you!
Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to measles shots we go...
Good fun, but how are we going to heigh-ho while gliding?
Who wants to go to the Castle for apple cider after we're done here?
Yes, fellows, Sleepy and I are having an affair.
You listen to one Jethro Tull, wait till you hear Stairway to Heaven
The Brothers Grimm will be judging the performance--skate well and it becomes part of the tale!!
Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to improved productivity you go!
Dopey, put your helmet on!
I hear they're going to give you hockey sticks and call you the Anaheim Mighty Dwarfs!
This is going to make a great sequel.
Glide-ho, Glide-ho. It’s round and round we go.
You're making history! This is Humanity's first Roller Derby!!
But I only meant it metaphorically !"
You've all been cast in "The Avengers:  Short Game"
Good jazz hands, fellas!
They told Bob Fosse to come up with a family friendly show
Grumpy Blick. White! This is your final warning. Dance with a smile or it's curtains for you.
But I tell you, skating IS a form of working.
We're millennial dwarfs, so it's off to work YOU go Snow White.
So you all have decided.........we are going roller skating before the ball!
Come on Grumpy.  Things would be much better if you would just smile a little.
Doc!  More brownies!
Right! Now we turn that mirror into a mirror ball!
Trust me, Disney on Field will be the next big thing.
Great, we have a hockey team
Lets’s play a game...Simon says everyone stop moving!
you remind me of your father.
No, it's still not time for couples skate, but thanks for asking again.
Sorry, love's first kiss belongs to a skateboarder
I said fairest in the land, not fastest
You have no idea just how disturbing this appears to me.
OK, you guys distract the guard while I sneak in and crack the safe.
So, you're all named "Dorky?"
Okay fellas, line up.  You will all get your turn.
Go home Snow White. It's time for us to move on.
I made a pie this big with all your apples.
If Mr. Disney could see you now!
FANTASTIC! I say we're ready to give our "Snow White Sidewalk Capades"  performance!
Talk about being woke."
Snow White and the Six Dwarves fail to understand depression.
My emotions are on a roll today
My great grandfather, Pinocchio, invented the roller skate.
Roller dwarfy is definitely my new favourite extreme sport!
Off to work we go, my ass!
Will you little shits stop following me?!!!
‘Cool! I’ve never seen skates with six wheels!’
And when she gets here, you boys push her off the cliff.
Now that I brought you here, would you please stop singing that ridiculous song?
It's time you knew the truth about the nose thing.
Let's build a ramp and do some sick jumps.
Heaven's yes, we sure showed that bitch how we roll!
Y'all are on a roll, eh?
That's it, you've all got it! Now, try it down the steep hill over there.
So,have you little guys voted to see who gets to play "DOC" today?
Skate your way to regularity and social ostracism!
I may be a dwarf, but I'm huge.
Come on, let’s do the Hokey-Pokey!
Remember, the hardest part about rollerblading is challenging gender norms.
I have accepted an offer to be an adjunct professor at a New York City University. Sorry, I can't bring you all along, since I'll be moving into a studio apartment in the lower east side.
Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, our commute to work ain't slow.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's to the rink we go!
HOLY FUCK! SHIT! WOW!
Now we're both the fairest and fastest in the land!
I can't wait to see your productivity stats!
The snow is a little ironic.
Great news! The Roller Derby Association just awarded us the Brooklyn franchise. We will be named AOC and The Seven Little Pelosies.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to the ER you'll go.
The royalties just keep rolling in.
Okay, five more minutes and then it's nap time.
Who wants to go with me to help the three little pigs?
I may be fairest in the land, but you guys are now the fastest.
Smile everyone!  This won't be our ticket outta here unless you smile!
Now when you go to the mines, you can rock and roll.
OK! Next we’re gonna learn to “crack the whip! “
If you strike gold, we can get ice skates next year.
I hear Octomom and group are one step ahead of us.
Dopey: “Sure, working in the mines is fun!”
Grumpy: “Notice how Snow’s nose keeps growing when she says that?”
Hey, you ought to see the Queen’s nose!
I guess outside mines everything feels like a fairytale.
Cool! Now it's fair when we play tag!
Roller skates made it much easier for the cast to traverse between theme parks.
Simon Cowell will plotz!
Gandalf called, he'll be here to pick you guys up in an hour.
I got rid of my good looks, you guys got skates, and we lived happily every after.
Well, a deal’s a deal so...hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to Venice Beach we go!
If you can find two more, we can have a team.

Grumpy...You need to be tickled...... and often ...and by someone who knows how!
OK, Donald. If we stop calling you Grumpy, will you play nice?
Snow White just got whiter.
In this group, each of you has a distinct roll.
Wonderful effort, but we need to shorten up the routine.
Why didn't you little shits stop me from eating that apple? You're useless I say, useless!
Once Hungry, Sniffly, Blinky, Dizzy, Vapid, Wobbly, Snarky and Brad show up we'll have a full roller derby team!

Me next!
It's a great diversion for the celibate.
Is this your first winter of  discontent?

OK, guys, it's time to go off to work on the cartoon caption.
Are we having fun? The next part is called the Iditarod.
Feels on wheels
I'm looking for Tyrion Lannister.
Unionization gone bad.
Something's different...you're all taller!
Seven, in the hay?
So if you just shave off the beards and pretend that you're my septuplets, we'll make a killing on the internet and can forget about Prince Charming
If I hit her right, she goes down like a bowling pin then they tie her down and she writes a book about it
Ok guys, who is going to play Horny with my tonight?
Well...i need to pee.
Now everyone say, "Hello Instagram!"
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, 'Who is the stablest of them all?'
Hi, ho.
Since it didn't work out between me and the Prince, I'm gonna try speed-dating-on-wheels.
On the bright side—you finally got a roll.
If it snows, you guys better hope my prince will come.

So glad they didn't pressure me to buy them Pelotons!
Can I shake my groove thing too ?
Whistle while you role
I know you all were getting tired of whistling, but I don’t know if roller skates will really help your productivity...
Be nice guys, six dwarves is only policy, not law.
Winterfell is just over there. Let’s go say ‘Hi’.
C'mon, Grumpy, give me my iPhone.
Come to mama.
Sorry guys. That's not what I meant by rollercoaster.
Retirement from the mine has allowed for an interesting choice of hobby.
I would let you try these blades, but Grumpy here doesn't seem to enjoy it.
Watch out now, Sneezy.
Hard too be grumpy or Sleepy on rollerblades
Grumpy, I know this isn't easy for you, but it isn't often we get to compete in the roller derby.
Learning everyones names is a bit much, but I will give it a try
It feels like just Yesterday, I laid down. How long have I been asleep.
This would be a lot easier if I had my shotgun...
I promise, Grumpy, just a little longer and you can have your screen time.
That will be $5.95 each for the skate rentals.
Next lets invent Roller Derby
Yes, I would love for you to get me an apple from the picnic basket.
I'm thinking reality TV along the lines of little people, big forest.
How thoughtful of you to want to keep up with me!

I suppose next thing you'll be looking for paved roads
See?  Isn't this fun?
You guys don't whistle on your breaks, too?
Has anyone seen my skateboard?
hey doc have you seen my viagra it was sitting on my dresser?
I need it for my date tonight
Who wants ice cream? Grumpy's treat!
By any chance, could you tell me how to find the lollipop guild?
Oh, Grumpy, have fun and smile!
Just remember, there are no stupid questions, Dopey!
is Everybody hungry? We have lots of tweets waiting for us back at the White House!
Oh, you're just so cute! You must be Squeezy, not Sneezy. I'd just love to hug you and give you a kiss!
Sorry Grumpy but yes, I did use heavy starch on purpose.
I've never had a date, who split up to skate, for now I see seven, shall I wait for eight?
I would love to be 'Big Momma' on your roller derby team.
This is a fun first date!
I heard what you just said, you little pervert!
Wait... where's Clumsy?
Poor Sneezy! I see Doc's already tried out his new finger.
Going undercover as a roller derby team is a great idea, Grumpy!
If you’re going to stay with us, you just need to know one thing - this is how we roll.
No Dopey, there's no need for PEDs in roller skating!

How lovely! Reminds me of our Congress skating aimlessly about!
Hiho hiho, it's off to the Otolaryngologist we go.
Feeling snubbed in the roller-skating competition, Grumpy wondered if she was truly “the fairest of them all.”
I’m here!  Let’s go to Dizzyland!!
That prince will not here soon enough!
One more and we can do figure eights!
Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy and Bashful, don't you feel better now that you are up and out of bed?
He'd always just been good ol' "Sleepy", but something changed the day Snow White showed up, and from that day forward they all called him "Creepy".
Grimm brothers had no skates in the story.

How tall was our father?
We should have named you 'Cranky'
A good roller derby team focuses on speed, not size.
Me too; me too; me too; me too; me too; me too; me too!
Ready? And,  five, six, seven eight!
You guys are much more lively after a night at The Roxy.
After they were lied to about coal coming back the seven dwarfs took jobs at the roller rink, where they could put their energy skills to work.

I guess Grumpy didn't have his vape today.
No more "Hi Ho and off to work you go." You boys can skate with me for a living.
But I thought there were seven of you.
It’s not the whistling while you work, I just don’t like your friends.
And if 'on ice' goes well, we might get 'live action'!
Another birthday, huh? And the skating rink rather than that tired old bouncy castle ... good call.

Do these seven dwarfs make me look fat?
Looking good, miners, but this isn't what I meant by  "roll with the punches".
We’ll call them organic in-line skates, get a patent, have an IPO and sell out to Nike!
See. Now our hikes aren’t that bad.
Why it’s Ice White!

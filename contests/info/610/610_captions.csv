'Bad news. They found the proof in the pudding.'
You can keep calling it "flambé," but out here it's felony arson.
They're asking if you prefer gas or electric...
Beat until stiff meant the eggs.
The good news is they're letting you prepare your last meal.
Cooking meth doesn't make you a chef, Steve.
For heaven's sake give them the recipe!
On the bright side, he'll never give you a bad review again.
Prepare to serve ten to twenty.
On the bright side, your "Death by Chocolate" exceeded expectations.
When you said you were going to grill the witness I had no idea.
As White House chef, you must have been expecting this.
Good news. I found an attorney specializing in torte law.
As the White House Chef, half the world is hailing you as a hero for at least attempting it.
No. I told you “poisson.”
Evidently, the jury found it hard to swallow, too.
No one cares that the knife came out clean.
It doesn't look good. The butcher and the candlestick maker both took a plea.
You didn’t find it suspicious that they were selling oregano by the ounce?
They're making you out to be some kind of a butcher.
I guess the Times' restaurant critic has more clout than we realized.
We're rebranding. "Killer Chef" is out. "Serving Thyme" is in.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that little tart!
So who's the chef at Mar-a-lago now?
On the positive side, you're the reason the prison cafeteria now has a Michelin rating.
For 30 years at home you never cooked. After two weeks in prison you're the chef?
Everyone else got 12 years, for some reason you got 13.
You and I both know salt is the real killer.
Honey, just tell them where you stashed the dough.
When someone orders their steak well done, you have to learn to just let it go.
Oh honey, 'shank' means something very different on the inside.
See if you can join the gang Martha Stewart was in
Have you decided...gas or electric?
Next time - just bake the gay wedding cake.
I distinctly said poisson!
The good news is you get to prepare your last meal.
You're looking at 20 years, 15 if you use convection.
I couldn’t raise the dough.
He said to tell you not to worry. Not only will you be pardoned, but you're going to be the new head of the FDA.
Let me make this simple, Simon. I've met a pie man.
How much thyme?
I've found a good torte lawyer.
They wanted to give you the electric chair, but I told them you'd prefer gas.
Don't lecture me about using a cake mix. Do you want the damn file or not?
So how's the food?
The good news is they've reduced your sentence to 45 minutes; the bad news is it's at 325 degrees
Death by Chocolate was clearly stated on the menu. The judge is going to dismiss the charges.
It's show about you and they're calling it "Baking Bad".
Seriously....you cooked the books?
Remember when i said I’d kill for 3 Michelin stars?
You should have let him put ketchup on his steak.
eHarmony said that you were a responsible professional in a secure environment.
What do you want me to do with the ah, meat in the garage freezer?
Organic, locally-sourced cocaine is still cocaine, dear.
I hope that tart was worth it.
They say you'll be out in 20, but will have to cool for another 10.
The butcher and the candlestick maker? They both have alibis.
I told you it was a recipe for disaster.
l told you not to take the White House chef job.
It's about your goose. It's cooked.
I warned you not to cook the books.
Well you are in Cook County Jail.
The good news is I've lost twenty pounds
No Maurice. What you did to that soufflé was criminal.
I want to believe you, dear, but the victim was battered.
No, I’m not your attorney. I’m Edith Mandlebaum and I’m here about my grandson’s bar mitzvah.
When the judge said you had to serve 8 to 10, he meant years not guests.
I know I said I'd wait for you, but I got really hungry.
We've renamed it "Four Guys".
How’s the food?
Bad news. Forensics found traces of gluten.
I miss your buns.
I told you not to accept the White House Chef Position.
Well, at least now you know the difference between price fixing and prix fixe.
LIMERICK: There once was a chef named Al Dente...Who had trouble paying the rente...So with each order to go, he started skimming some dough...And for embezzlement, to the prison he was sente.
So you’re saying the proof is in the pudding?
Remember, the first thing you need to do is find the biggest guy in the place, and make him lasagna
I agree Jules, gluten should not be a crime, but here we are.
So let me get this straight, they're making you cook your own last meal?
I knew that tart would get you in trouble.
Nevertheless, the murder-mystery dinner was complete hit.
The judge ruled the evidence inadmissible, but delicious.
You promised to stop poaching.
Just give me the recipe and I’ll drop the charges.
They've got you on prix fixing.
I...I have a microwave now.
I believe you when you say the butcher killed the candlestick maker. What I don’t understand is why you three were in the tub together in the first place.
I heard the butcher and the candlestick maker are turning state’s evidence.
....and where did you stash the dough?
They’ll knock off six months if you tell them where you hid the dough.
Maybe you should rethink that "Death by Chocolate" recipe.
You and your half-baked schemes!
I think you need to tell Mueller how you really got the chicken Kiev recipe.
While similar, "poisson" is actually the French word for fish.
On the plus side, THAT guy is not going to criticize your food anymore.
What you're calling avant-garde, they're calling cannibalism.
Well, look on the bright side. Maybe they'll give you a choice between gas and electric?
The butcher lawyered up, but I think the candlestick maker is talking.
'Death by chocolate' is just an expression.
How was I supposed to know the proof was in the pudding?
How’s the food?
Where'd you put the dough?
Bad news...the Butcher and Candlestick Maker both turned state's evidence.
Didn't I warn you it was a recipe for disaster?
So listen. I talked to Shelly's husband who is a branding guy, and he thinks "prison-to-table" really has legs.
In Wisconsin, margarine Is a crime.
See you next week at 3:50 for 25-30 minutes.
Your fingers were in too many pies.
I thought you should know that you left a bun in the oven.
Look at the bright side, our wine collection will be peaking when you get out.
It's over. I've bought a microwave.
'The charge is baking and entering.'
Really?! You used LARD! In California?
Gas or electric?
This sounds like yet another one of your half baked ideas.
Maybe now you'll remember the difference between 'poison' and 'poisson'.
I know, you kneaded the dough.
I was a little confused when you told me you were in the Cook County Jail.
The judge wants to know how long to put you in for.
Well, Don't cry to me. You're the one who wanted to be the White House chef.
Apparently you mentioned your Cherry Bombe to someone in line at the airport ticket counter.
When you say you'll be out in a dozen months, is that 12 or 13?
The butcher and the candlestick maker are taking a plea bargain.
'Dessert to die for' was supposed to be a metaphor.
Of course I don't believe adding cilantro is criminal...but that's not how the jury felt.
I gotta be honest, it's not looking good. The Butcher and the Candlestick Maker have already rolled over.
The butcher is standing strong but the candlestick maker is turning state witness.
Honey, I can't find a torte lawyer.
...but the detective said the proof is in the pudding.
The appeal failed. You're going to fry.
The lawyers are saying there was no proof in the pudding.
The Feds flipped the butcher and the candlestick maker. It's not looking good!
So, when you said "capers," you weren't talking condiments?
It was me. I spilled the beans.
I think you are getting your just desserts.
On the bright side, thanks to your incarceration, the prison just got its first Michelin star.
Even served cold, revenge gets you 10 to life.
Just give them the recipe and end this madness.
You should have just let him have ketchup on his steak.
They know about the gluten.
I do think it will hurt your chances for a third star.
So - long story short - you're being held by the Central Intelligence Agency, not the Culinary Institute of America.
They wouldn't have gotten suspicious if you hadn't capitalized the C in " roast Chuck ".
The good news is that baking and entering isn’t a serious offense.
I'm calling to cancel my reservation.
Asking for ketchup with his Beef Wellington! Of course, you should have shot him.
So where did you hide the dough?
The judge says you're gonna fry.
Don’t be upset, Paul, but I need your wedding cake recipe.
Couldn’t resist cooking the books, could you?
Poisson! Two “S”’s. Autocorrect is not a defense.
Hate to be the one to tell you but the butcher and candlestick maker have accepted plea agreements.
They said you're going to fry
So... there are two S's in poisson...
Couldn't you see that it was a recipe for disaster?
No. I dont remember the recipe for your tunnel cake.
Reportedly, the butcher and candlestick maker have already flipped.
So that's why they call it the Cook County Jail.
The proof was in the pudding.
Unfortunately, the judge agrees that your chocolate mousse soufflé was to die for.
....and where did you stash the dough?

They said they're gonna leave you in for 25 to 30, or until you appear done.
Truth be told, darling, I think you finally got your just deserts.
What do you mean, you were cooking the books?
No Steve, I don't want to know what a "tossed salad" means in prison.
It’s not looking good. The butcher and candlestick maker talked.
Your kale pasta is being treated as a hate crime.
Fred, will you be home for the Hollandaise?
I tried to warn you, it was a recipe for disaster.

They've definitely got you on salt and battering.
But darling, revenge is better served cold.
They will hear your case at the food court

When You said You where making killer brownies , I had no idea !

Tell me where you hid the dough.

When the restaurant critic said your foie gras was to die for, he was being ironic.

They say it'll be gas or electric.
You are not home; so yes, I put the knives in the dishwasher.
Your parole has been denied. The warden loves your bouillabaisse
I have a bun in the oven and it isn’t yours.
They say the proof was in the pudding

The butcher and the candlestick maker made bail.
This is what you get for cooking the books.
Non monsieur, poisson! Poisson! Non poison.
They say you'll fry for this
Just tell me where you hid the dough

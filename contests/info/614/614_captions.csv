No, I said to play with more attitude.
Your lesson was yesterday.
The Zen Way is on the next mountain. This is the Steinway.
I know you didn't send for a tuner. The people down in the valley did.
The public is saying your latest work is inaccessible.
Everyone wants the secret of life. No one asks how the hell I got this baby up here.
The Craigslist ad said it's free if I pick it up myself...?
Finally, a request.
I'm moving all of my music to the cloud.
To be honest with you, we regret both the promise of free delivery and the promise of lifetime tunings.
The meaning of life? No I don't know it, but maybe if you hum a few bars...
Is this the Steinway to Heaven?
Well that was a major scale!
You find out who your real friends are when you ask them to help you move.
Franz, just call it "Unfinished" and come down.
With a helicopter. You've got two questions left.
Sorry to tell you this; the divorce is now final, and she got the piano.
I know you're discouraged by the turnout, but I think it's the venue.
Am I late for my lesson?
I guess if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.
There've been complaints about the hills being alive with the sound of music.
I see that no one but you plays at this level.
How 'bout this time I show you how to tune the piano yourself?
Big deal! Try it with a piano on your back.
I play best when I'm high.
This is Enrichment. Enlightenment is the next ledge up.
Yup, no kidding, I just said, “Alexa, find live music nearby.”
It would help if you composed a bridge.
And this is where my musical career plateaued.
I've been sent to ask you if you know any other songs besides 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough?"
I was hoping to end this climb on a high note.
Your wife says she can still hear it.
I'm from the next mountain. Would you mind keeping it down after 10:00 PM?
Anything but "Climb Every Mountain."
Life is hard my son, Rachmaninoff is harder.
It's free, but you have to move it.
No, this is piano camp, base camp is further up.
Seriously, a two-drink minimum?
We're putting the band back together!
Practice? That's it .... Practice?
I'm afraid this will be my last lesson. I've found a teacher closer to home.
I’m the viola, any sign of the other three?
It's true—the aria is thinner up here.
Yesterday? I thought my lesson was today!
You're a good friend Gary. No one else bothered to show up for my recital.
What do you mean, 'sold out'?
What do you mean my lesson was cancelled?
Mom says just to call it “Unfinished” and come home for dinner.
The meaning of life? What key is it in?
I hope you have a good excuse. Your lesson was supposed to start 15 minutes ago.
On behalf of the entire valley, please stop practicing that song.
I don't know the meaning of life, but if you hum a few bars I'll try to play it.
Sam, I found you at last. Play it again.
The neighbors want me to ask you to keep it down.
Mom always told me you'd just gone to the store for cigarettes.
Sorry, my set just ended, but I play here every Thursday from 5 to 9.
May I change to monthly rather than weekly lessons?
Peak performance can mean something different to everybody.
No, no, no. I'm the Dalai Yamaha. The Dalai Lama is the next cliff up.
I came as soon as I heard you were in treble.
I don’t know the meaning of life, but if you hum a few bars I’ll fake it.
You canceled my lesson!?
Hi, I'm from Switzerland's Got Talent.
The folks at base camp wonder if you could keep it down a little.
You didn't, by any chance, bring up some music with you, did you?
What do you mean you're not taking requests?
Sorry, but your lesson was yesterday.
Well that was a hard scale.
Grandma says she'll take you back on the condition you take lessons and a shower.
We lost violins to the crevasse, cellos to the avalanche, but the woodwinds are right behind me.
Don’t just sit there throw me a chord
This clef was more treble than I thought.
Dad, this is NOT what I meant when I suggested that you store your music in the cloud!
For all that is holy, please say you are the piano tuner...
This is the last time I'm tuning this thing!
I'm here to talk about your student loans.
Oh, so you're the one keeping the hills alive?
Can we possibly do the next lesson at MY house?
That's it? The key to all existence is B?
What service elevator?
If you're shocked about Reagan, you'll never believe who's President now.
Oh, I have a little free time. Not many seek wisdom anymore.
What's the key to life?
Does it look like I know the way to San Jose?
I never intended to to make my music accessible.
I’m sorry but I’m not taking any new students.
Welcome to heaven, son. Yeah, most people are disappointed.
Ok now, from the top.
Cliff’s Notes.
"You know, 'performing at new heights' is generally taken metaphorically.
Mom says you can stop practicing now.
I know I told you that you were capable of playing at a much higher level, but this isn't what I meant.
I don't know The Meaning of Life, but if you hum a few bars, I'll play along.
Wow, so it really is lonely at the top.
Stairway to Heaven? Two hills over.
The first lesson is free.
Do you know 'Climb Every Mountain'?
Yeah, the site is breathtaking, but the acoustics are crap.
They didn’t literally mean “Go play it on the mountain”
Anything but "Climb Every Mountain."
It's my way or the Steinway
Keep climbing if you want to hear the harps.
Just passing on a message from the village below. They want to know if you can play ANYTHING other than 'The Hills are Alive', anything at all?
Is the flood over ??
The recital was yesterday.
No, I'm not a guru. I was banished from civilized society because I composed "Chopsticks."
Seriously, you should learn to tune your own piano.
Your lesson was an hour ago.
Which one is the key to happiness?
I see your career has plateaued.
No, I’ve just come by to tell you I’ve found a new teacher on 46th Street.
Now, THAT'S what I call a major scale!
When they said my concert ticket was in the nosebleed section, they weren't kidding.
It's worth it for the acoustics.
There's a cover charge?
Not to be a bother, but would you mind keeping it down?
Ya know, Dad, when you said 'mid-life crisis', I was kinda hoping you meant we were getting a sports car.
Oh good, my page turner is here. Did you bring a chair?
Your ticket is for next week’s performance
So this is where you’ve been Haydn.
The villagers want you to stop playing Stairway to Heaven.
Well, the tuning is only $90, the other $910 is a inconvenience surcharge.
No, it was here when I arrived.
They didn't say it was a piano - I'll have to bring another guy.
Excuse me, would you mind completing a short survey regarding your piano delivery experience?
Do you know 'She'll be comin' around the mountain'?
I'll be right back. I left my tools in the truck.
I'd like to hear that once more, from the top.
Wait. I could have used the freight elevator?
My fee for tuning your piano is $75, with travel expenses your bill should about $8,000.
You haven't made a payment in three months, I'm sorry my boss says I have to take it back.
Ticket?
Well, hello Dalai.
I thought I heard 'Stairway To Heaven'.
Yes, I know the meaning of life, and it goes something like this....
And you're complaining about a backpack?
You wouldn't happen to know 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain', do you?
Next time let's practice at my place.
You're in luck. I carried a tune.
I don't think this is what they meant when they said, 'be more like Monk.'
So this is why the hills are alive with the sound of music.
These are the Ivory Gates. The Pearly Gates are a little higher.
'How did I get it here? I ordered it on Amazon.'
No, I don't have any rope, but I can give you a chord.
So that's what you meant about ending your career on a high note.
I knew you said you were playing Off-Broadway, but this is ridiculous.
Hey, thanks for filling in.
It's lonely at the top, kid.
I'm the drummer. The string section didn't make it.
It's STILL unfinished??
Finally, the old man and the C.
It looked brown in your Craigslist ad. Sorry, I'm gonna have to pass.
Mr. Steinway, I presume?
Don't matter where you came from...I don't do requests.
Why, yes, I did pack a candelabra.
I don't know "The Meaning Of Life" but hum a few bars and I'll fake it.
I was looking for the fool on the hill but I'm pretty sure you'll do.
How did I get up here? Practice, practice, practice
I'll tune it here, once, but after this, you gotta bring it to the shop.
Your audition has been moved to next week.
Wow! Made it! Saw the ad... piano still for sale?
When you said you ‘made it to the top’, I thought you meant ‘the charts’
The piano tuning is complimentary, but the house call is ten thousand dollars.
You're seeing me at my peak.
Piano tuner??? I’m a locksmith. They said you were having a problem with a Key!!!
I’ll be right back with the bench.
I have kind of bad news about the orchestra.
Sorry, I thought they said someone was decomposing up here.
I see why the guide called this a major scale.
They want to know if you can keep it down
Sorry. Your ticket is for the Thursday evening performance.
Stupid GPS! I'm looking for the Grand Canyon not the Grand Piano!
Tell me, how is it true that one cannot be both upright and grand?
Finally...someone can help me turn the pages!
Do you know anything besides "Climb Every Mountain"?
Stairway to heaven. Really?
Just wanted to let you know, that should be an F sharp.
What do you mean it's sold out?
I've learned that great acoustics aren''t the only consideration when choosing a venue.
No, Carnegie Hall is in New York. This is Carnegie Hill.
The bass player's stuck in a crevice. Can you vamp for a while?
My lesson is today, right?
I'll tune it but I won't move it.
I can't work with these interruptions.
You the guy who ordered the tux?
Welcome, you're the first. It's open seating.
Your playing has plateaued.
Was that Stairway to Heaven?
Sounds like your creativity has plateaued
You scale your way, I'll scale mine.
10,000 feet and all you’ve got is ‘Chopsticks’?
Ok, once more from the top.
Nope, I don't play either.
I climbed to the top of Everest for piano lessons? (submittd by Wes, age 8)
You're on in five, sir.
Mom says she can still hear you.
Steinway, I presume.
Could I have just a moment of your time today to chat about the amazing Book of Mormon?
You gotta make that last payment. I REALLY don’t want to repo this baby!
The administration ran out of nominees. We want you to head the VA.
I thought I heard 'Stairway To Heaven'.
The meaning of life? It goes a little something like this...
Do I know The meaning of life? Hum the first few bars and I'll pick it up
Next time can we rehearse at my home?
Mom says dinner is ready.
You look like you could use some accompaniment.
What a relief! Everyone assumed you were de-composing.
I can play your request, but only once you have freed yourself from the desire to hear it.
Practice doesn't always get you to Carnegie Hall, my son.
It’s hard, ya know...I really feel like I’ve hit a plateau here.
Enlightenment wasn't paying the bills, so I also write jingles.
Can you tune a piano?
Don't worry, I'll have you tuned up in time. The audience is at least two hours behind me.
Do you know "Rocky Mountain High"?
I ‘m the yodeler, your opening act
I'm your neighbor from the plateau 2,000 feet below... Do you think you could keep it down?
Sorry for you trouble. maestro, but the yodelers would rather sing a cappella, after all.
Your playing has hit a plateau.
Critics are saying you've plateaued.
Let's take it from the top
Were you the one playing “Climb Every Mountain?”
Play that one about coming round the mountain
My wife actually wants the piano in the living room, after all.
It's $25 for the pedal, and $2500 for shipping and handling.
The problem is, you're playing too high.
Really? The Hokie Pokie is what it's all about?
I have to cancel next Thursday’s lesson.
I hope you brought some new music.
I hear you’ve reached a creative plateau.
Masterpiece or not! This is the last time I go for more paper.
I don't know the meaning of life, but if you hum a few bars I can fake it.
What happened to the restaurant that was here a few weeks ago?
Please tell me you're the piano tuner.
That's what I call a major scale.
I hope you're the piano tuner.

I don't know "what's the meaning of life", can you hum a few bars?
I climb all the way up here and you go on break?
Would you mind keeping it down?
I'm the repo guy. Please tell me you have the balance owed.
Now that I’ve reached my peak, I just don’t feel like playing anymore”
You know everyone stopped listening right?
I'm here to collect royalties for the copyrighted music you've been playing.
I'm from the mountain top next door. Could you please keep it down.
Maestro! The conductor said take it FROM the top!
They sit at the bar and put bread in my jar and say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
No, I won't play " Climb Every Mountain. "

Of all the piano joints in all the towns in all the world, you had to climb into mine.
They heard you in the valley and decided to send a piano tuner.
You the guy who called for a piano tuner?
I'm here with the price quote from Acme movers. Are you sitting down..?
I'm not taking anymore requests. We're about to close.
What do you mean you found someone else to tune the piano?
Don't feel bad, every pianist eventually plateaus.
I understand somebody called for a piano tuner.
Hello. Amazon Prime delivering your new piano strings.
I'm here to compose myself.
Can you take it from the top?
No, it's a great song. But I have some bad news about Sinatra.
Great! Now, can you turn the pages for me?
Was I playing too loud?
I'm just a sad guy at the piano, the wisdom guy is two mountains over.
Do you know the way to San Jose?
So tell me -- what is the key to happiness?
No, this is Grand Piano. Grand Teton is over there!
They were right - this climb does end on a high note.
I can't keep doing this. Just title it 'The Unfinished Symphony' and come on down.
So this is why the hills are alive with the sound of music.
I was hoping for angels and harps.
Wow, it’s amazing how hard it is to find live music these days!
The guy on the next mountain over says you're interfering with his meditation.
"Johann, come Bach!'
Dinner's ready
Well, ordinarily I recommend getting it tuned every year, but let's not let perfect be the enemy of good.
Don't be discouraged: Scales are difficult.
O.K. Where do you want it moved to?
Whadd'ya mean you're past your peak? This is simply a plateau.
I requested a page turner, not a cliffhanger
Please stop playing, “Climb every mountain”.
I don't mind going out of my way to support the arts.
Can you play Stairway to Heaven?
Mom says you can stop lessons if you just come home.
Did you bring the piano bench?
The key to life is B-natural.
I've plateaued, son.
So you're a soloist?
The bad news is that the tuba player won't make it
I fear my musical career has reached a plateau.
Let what be?
Let''s try that scale again.
Didn't there used to be a restaurant up here?
Sorry, I'm not feeling well today and have to cancel your lesson.
We can get it down but I'm not sure it will go in the van
Please tell me you're the tuner.
Next time band practice is at my house...
I wanted this brought down with the 2 tablets.
Yes but are you THE Piano Man?
Keep practicing and I'll see you next week.
Can you keep it down please? We're trying to sleep in Base Camp.
The couple in K-2 say to keep it down.
Darn. This used to be a great little Italian restaurant.
I thought I heard someone playing "The Fool on the Hill."

The moving company says no.
"Can you tell me the meaning of Philip Glass's music?
Can we count on your donation to the alumni association?
Is this a bad time?
Haven't had a crowd this big in years
It's free if you can haul it away.
No Grandpa, this is NOT how you save music to the cloud!
Please don't tell me you forgot the bench.
Thank God you're here; I need you to turn the page.
Nice scale, now try it descending.
There was no piano on the other mountain top. Apparently it was an echo.
So the key to happiness is the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift?
Telegram from Juilliard Admission — I’m afraid it’s bad news...
I’ve peaked.
If I fall, I'd like to go out on a high note.
Mom says it's time for dinner
You call for a piano tuner?
Sounds like you've peaked.
All I’m saying is the Craigslist photos made it look like real mahogany.
"I couldn't wait any longer. I tuned it myself".
Now try it with a piano on your back.
Sorry, no requests.
Ain't no mountain high enough, really?
Can you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?
You the guy who ordered the panini tuna
This time I'm teach you how to tune it yourself.
Turns out we don't have that part in stock.
You're on next.
Nope, this is Elton John covers. Meaning of life is two peaks over.
Yeah I’m gonna have to take her back to the shop if you want it fixed right.
Is this the Steinway to enlightenment?
Of all the bars in all the world...
Looks like you've reached the height of your musical career.
Are you the guy who called for a piano tuner?
no, you're a couple miles off; this is the (italicize next word, please) Baby Grand Canyon.
Finally, He said, "It's either my way or the Steinway."
I was beginning to wonder if anyone would show up.
So worth it. The acoustics are amazing
Actually, there are 88 keys to enlightenment.
Am I too late for my lesson?
The key to life is B#??
The ending is a real cliffhanger
I don't know the path to enlightenment. But if you hum a few bars, I can fake it.

I'm sorry. I no longer take requests.

Wow, how did you get up here?” “Practice, practice, practice.
You're alive! Rumour was you were up here decomposing.
No, this is Baroque.. Enlightenment is two peaks over to the left.
The recital was last week.
The first movement was a little rocky.
The neighbors were complaining
Could you keep it down? Thanks.
Did you bring the piano bench?
Well, looks like we’ve both hit a plateau...

And I say your Craigslist ad never said the bench WASN'T included.
"The Secret to Life"? No, but if you hum a few bars...
'No, son, I don't know the secret to happiness. But maybe if you hum a few bars...'
Take Five.
Looks like you're decomposing up here.

Never mind. I thought tonight was Yo-Yo Ma.
Thanks. That ascending scale really helped.
Wow, a Canyon Grand!
Now hold your breath. I got you a two week gig on the Matterhorn.
Take it from the top!
Um, I'm from the mountain next door, and some of us are trying to sleep....
Can you play an ascending scale?
Remote? Actually I've always found your music quite accessible.
Seriously? Do I have a ticket?
I’m your new page-turner.
I'd say you're at peak performance.
I’m sorry. The recital is tomorrow at 2 pm.
"Sorry, I don't know 'The Meaning Of Life', but if you hum a few bars I can fake it".
I know we've worked together for forty years, but my knees are shot. You're going to have to find another tuner.
I saw your ad on Craig's list. Does the price include delivery?
Practice is cancelled?
How the hell'd you even GET a Coke to spill on the keyboard?
OMG! It's a Baldwin.
Meaning of life? Bring the flute, leave the piano.
So this is where the one hit wonders go...

I’m here from the homeowner association. We’ve had complaints.
Being the only piano tuner in the Himalayas isn't easy, either.

I wouldn't have written that concerto if I'd known it was this lonely at the top.
Could you play a little lower?
The people down in the village say if they hear "Heart and Soul" one more time they're coming after you.
Don't fret, even Ludwig von Beethoven hit a plateau.
Is this a bad time?
So before I leave, just the sheet music for “Autumn Leaves” and toilet paper?
I climbed every mountain.
We've decided to go with the singing nun instead.
The band would love to have you back if this solo thing doesn't work out.
But at basecamp they said you DID take requests.

Can you play “The Hokey Pokey”? I hear that’s what it’s all about...
Could you play 'Night on Bald Mountain'?
Do you know the stairway to heaven?
I’m looking for bass camp.
You've aged well, Schroeder. And that piano!
Bob! You are going to feel like a fool bringing yours. There is another piano up here!
There's a cover?
What do you mean? Who would shlep a clarinet up a mountain?
So the lyric ‘climb every mountain’ is just a metaphor ?!
Can you play Rockmaninoff?
So there really ain't no mountain high enough to keep you from getting to me.
No, I don't know "The Meaning of Life." Can you hum a few bars?
I'm afraid I don't know the meaning of life, but maybe you can hum a few bars?
You the guy who called for a piano tuner?
This will be my last lesson, I’m taking up the violin.
Any last requests?
So, it's true. You peaked.
"Stairway to Heaven" turns out to be quite misleading.
You must be the Abominable Chopin.
I will play you the Hokie Pokie , because that is what it is all about
Request night is Thursday.
Enlightment? Well maybe if you hum a few bars...
No I don't know "Stairway to Heaven".
Can you keep it down ?
Excuse me, can you play Rocky Mountain High?
Finally, an audience!
I'll be right back with a tuning fork
Great, you made it! Now help me bring up the fridge.
Thank God, I’ve been waiting for years! Do you know the song Heart and Soul?
Really? "How did I get it up here" is your first question? Really?
I’m sorry, but your pizza might be a little cold
Sorry, this is base clef camp. Base camp is the next peak over.

Here to learn the 88 keys to success?
Talk about nosebleed seats.
Hi, I'm your piano mover.
Climb every mountain, then what?
Finally, an audience!
A real wise man would have thought about taking a few lessons before lugging that thing up a mountain.
This is orchestra seating, balconies are higher up.
I've come to see that, yes, your musicianship has reached a plateau.
Well this climb certainly ended on a high note.
Hi neighbor, would you mind taking it down a notch after 8?
did you bring the other piano?
Did you call a tuner?
Are you still taking requests?
Great job today Alan, saw some real progress since our last lesson. Same time next week?
I always wanted to end the climb in a high note.
You got all the way up here in sandals?
It took me 46 years to put this thing together. I hope you're a tenor.
I would clap, but my arms are kind of busy at the moment...
The record company sent me. They want their advance back.
I got your note.
Can I have the name of your sherpa?
I'm answering your ad about a piano for sale.
Please tell me you play duets
Did I just hear 'Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain?'
You beat me to the top AND you brought a piano?
Next time, tune it yourself!
You left out some pertinent info when you asked me to help you move.
You the guy that called for a tuning
The piano tuner sends his regrets
Key changes come from within.
This appears to be one of the more difficult passages.
If you are Sam, I'm to tell you to play it again.
Wow, I thought bringing my accordion was tough.
Nobody told me about a cover charge.
We meet again.
I don't know. Same as you, I guess. Because it's there.
No, I don't know the meaning of life, but if you hum a few bars...
Sorry you had to wait so long. It's a long way from bass camp all the way up here to the treble cliff.
Is this where the outdoor concert is?
This is the piano bar. The restaurant is on K-4, two ridges over. And you'd best have a reservation, they don't take climb-ins.
Scaling. Tell me about it.
I'm here for the page turner job
I suppose there’s more than one way to scale a mountain.
I knew it was too good to be true when you said"I love playing the piano and getting high".
I climbed all this way for Shostakovich?
Your Craig's List ad said if you pick it up, you can have it.
You're late again, Krimwald, and I have another pupil coming in 17 minutes.
Ah, a true master of scaling.
Base camp? No, this is piano camp.
What is the meaning of "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"?
You the guy that called for a piano tuner ?
They sent me to ask you not to practice before 10 AM.
OK, once again from the top.
Are you the guy who's looking to sell a piano?
Sorry, we're closed on Mondays.
They said you were decomposing.
Something uplifting, please.
I guess "practice, practice, practice" didn't get you to Carnegie Hall.
I came here to get better but I've just kind of plateau'd.
I feel like my musical abilities have plateaued
You said you were going scaling, and would be Bach in a Minuet!
I came to put bread in your jar and say, “Man, what are you doing here?”
Encore.
Do you know "On Top Of Old Smoky?"
The fat lady sang
Hey, could you keep it down?
It’s not ready. Come back tomorrow.
So, you're saying A minor has been the key to enlightenment this whole time?
I am the piano tuner.
I heard the sound of music.
Let's take it from the top
My largest audience yet!
Seriously? B minor is the key to inner peace?
I thought it was a metaphor when you said you had reached a plateau.
I hope you're the piano tuner.
Thought you could just skip your piano lesson, did you?
I'm trying to win the New Yorker caption contest, any ideas?
You took performing solo to new heights.
I've hit a plateau.
Is this bass camp?
Wait; so THOSE are the 88 keys to a happy life?
Am I late for my lesson?
Getting it here was easy. The challenge is keeping it in tune.
Odd. I was just here a couple of months ago for a caption, and it was a restaurant.
It's about time you got here. I need someone to turn the pages.
Is it too late to get the free piano you put on Craigslist?
Listen, could you stop playing "Climb Every Mountain"?!
Know 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain'?
You've been a great audience.
I'll be back with the violin, viola and cello in two weeks.
I guess you might say I've been decomposing.
You take the high way; I'll take the Steinway!
No, I didn't see the elevator.
I 'd like to hear something Uplifting
Did you bring my cliff notes?
Oh isn't that just grand.
I practiced my scales but only ascending.
I've been following your concert tour.
Was that really your peak performance?
You want to know how I got here? How about the piano?
Sorry, I'm late. Where do you want the harp?
I guess I can now scratch this off of my bucket Liszt
Phil of the Nepal Philharmonic, I presume.
Could you give me a Handel?
So is this what you call a rock concert.
No, I am not accepting new students...
The Piano Tuner Cometh.
Do you realize how far that sound travels in this cold dry air. Can’t you advance beyond chopsticks. It’s driving us crazy.
I brought you the wind proof candelabra that you ordered.
I don't care how hard the climb was, I still don't take requests.
You the guy selling a piano on eBay?
steep clef?
You've ignored all those past notices, so I've come to repossess the piano.
I don’t care how far you’ve come- I don’t do requests.
Hello. I called about the craig's list ad?
Is that the piano you want to be tuned?
Excuse me Sir, we've had a noise complaint.
Would you PLEASE stop playing “Climb Every Mountain?
Apparently, your talent has reached a plateau.
You placed an ad for a page turner?
TALK ABOUT A MAJOR SCALE!
That song is copyrighted.
Thanks for coming to my gig. Was the place easy to find?
I'm not a big rock fan.
I've reached the pinnacle of my career. It's pretty much all downhill from here.
RockManinoff?
Damn! I forgot the stool.
So, the hills really are alive with the sound of music.
Okay, I'll be back with the cello in eight years.
Are you sure it was a Titleist?
No, I don't know 'The Meaning of Life," but if you hum a few bars I could probably figure it out.
You send for a piano tuner?
May I accompany you on the way down?
The folks at base camp were wondering if you could play something besides the requium.
So this is what they meant by 'scale'.
I was told the first lesson was free.
Never mind how it got here. Do you have a request?
I am required to inform you that if you continue to play his covers, my client is legally entitled to compensation.
There's a request from the neighbors that you stop playing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."
Piano mover? No, they told me you wanted a piano tuner.
If you're not the person who called for a piano tuner, I'm going to kill myself.
'I know it's tough getting here, but honestly, my music sounds much better when you're high.'
Isn't it grand?
The rest of the ensemble has decided to scale the south face.
Am I the only one who made it to the music summit?
Folks in the valley thought you might appreciate having a tuner.
I really just need the name of your movers.
I heard you needed a page-turner.
Do you know "Nearer My God to Thee"?
Where should I set up the second piano?
Are you from the piano moving company?
I didn't even see the box office will call window What do you mean my ticket is at will call ?
I suspect you're in the wrong range.
You're right, there ain't no mountain high enough.
I came just as soon as I heard.
Would you PLEASE stop playing “Climb Every Mountain?
Dad, most men just get a new car or buy a motorcycle.
Sorry, I only tune uprights.
I was told that you were in possession of the lost chord is that true.
Meaning of life? You’ll have to hum the first few bars for me.
I don't care how enlightened your playing is, it is 3am and some of us on this mountain have to work in the morning, so knock it off or I am calling the cops!
Meaning of life? Sorry, I don’t do requests.
Play and they will come.
Is this the summit or just another Shangri-La-themed piano-lounge base camp?
it must be lonely at the top
When I said I wanted you to start again from the top this wasn't what I was imagining, David.
'Any requests?'
Take Five.
You DON'T take requests???
Would you mind keeping it down?
I think your career's plateaued.
Seriously? I'm the first person to request "Climb Every Mountain"?
Last month there was a restaurant here.
Not quite what I was expecting when they told me there was a "grand" in it, if I were to rescue you.
Who am I!? I'm the classical music critic from the New Yorker.
Ain’t No Mountain High Enough?” Hilarious. How about a few bars of “Free Fallin’?
Well, isn't this grand.
Now, you are ready for a lesson.
Tomorrow...come back tomorrow. I’m practicing.
I'm the tuner.
I did hear that the top would B flat.
Still unfinished?
So you're telling me I climbed all this way, just so you can tell me you don't take requests.
One more time, take it from the top!
I really mean it this time. This is the last free tuning that came with the piano.
That was A major scale.
So that's what the middle pedal does!
“Climb Every Mountain.” Wow. What an original request.
Sorry to interrupt.
Did someone call for a piano tuner?
Sorry, is this a bad time?
Do I know the meaning of life? Can you hum a few notes?
I can't keep doing this every time you need a haircut.
Darn it! I wanted to see you in concert before you peaked.
Are you the guy who ordered a piano tuner????
Don’t worry, the other mover brought down everything else.
Classical music isn't dying. It's just plateaued.
I have a score to settle.
I was told, that you'd be bringing a cello.
Getting the piano up here wasn't the problem. Holding the sheet music in place is.
You must be into rock.
What do you mean, a tuner? I was told to bring tuna!
Is this the piano listed on Craigslist for $275 firm?
Sorry. This is an invitation-only event.
Sisyphus thought he had it tough!
Can you quiet down a bit? Some of us are trying to rock climb over here.
Yeah, the view is nice, but I work for tips, you know?
Sorry, they said it was cheaper to move it up here than to your 2nd floor apartment on Central Park West.
Are you the one who asked for a piano tuner?
Could you keep it down, we're trying to have a quiet weekend, thanks.
Being God is just my day job.
We've received a noise complaint, one mountain over.
Your songwriting career has plateaued.
You called for a page turner?
Would a little Stairway to Heaven have been so hard?
Unfortunately, your cellist is having difficulty finding parking.
What do you mean you cancelled the afternoon recital!
Your Commandments were original and timely. Your piano, today, ... not so much.
Just a heads up, I think I'm going to have to find a closer piano teacher
I was told your compositions rise to another level.
I’ve come for the free piano. How firm is the ‘no delivery’ clause?
Oh, excellent! Still some good seats left!
Regrettably, I'm no longer taking requests.
I don't care how far you've come, I don't do requests.
I'm sorry, I don't know that one.
You missed my recital, Doug.
Sorry, but I found that rendition of Air on the G string a bit thin
I don't know "Climb every mountain."
Can you play “Sitting On Top of the World”?
Rachmaninoff, I presume..
Ok, once more from the top.
Your estimate to move it to New York City will be $822,000.
...Great crowd. Anyone here from New Jersey tonight?
I was told that you bring the piano to new levels.
I don't know the meaning of life, but if you hum a few bars I can fake it.
I wanted to know why the hills were alive with the sound of music....
"Sorry, the only piece I know is, 'I'm Sitting on Top of the World'".
I am repossessing your piano.
Is this the final destination of the Bach-packing trip?
No, I don't take requests.
Yes, I'm the piano tuner.
Am I too late for my lesson?
Your neighbors are complaining.
i'm with the band.
Good news! We got you Carnegie Hall!
There’s a freight elevator?
Just to be clear this is your last warranty free turning.
Wait...don't tell me...practice, practice, practice.
Sure , I take requests
Somebody called for a tuner?
Seriously? F Minor is the key to the universe?
They say the the acoustics were better before the renovation.
Wait, I got it! How about, "...ford every stream"?
I’m here for my 4:30 lesson
I came to hear your peak performance.
Despite all your grandiose accomplishments, it’s my way or the Steinway.
Do you know the meaning of life? Hum a few bars and I'll fake it.
I was looking for a stairway, not a Steinway.
The visuals of this space are magnificent, the acoustics not so much.
Know it! Hell, I wrote it.
So that's the ascending; now repeat the descending scale.
I'll look again, but I'm telling you - it's not down there.
I’m your new page-turner.
I'm the warm-up act. Wise man comes on at eight.
Maybe instead of 'Stairway To Heaven' you should play 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough.'
Let me guess.. 'As Time Goes By'?
When did the restaurant close?
I don’t take requests.
Seriously? All you’ve got for me is, “Perhaps the key to life is not F# minor after all?”
Alright, start again from the top.
Well, yes, as it happens, I do have a tuning fork.
Looks like we've both been working on our scales.
The hills are alive with requests that you give it a rest.
That rendition was your best everest!
I have a request from the Sherpas to play "Ain't No Mountain High Enough".
What happened to the restaurant that was here a few weeks ago?
That was a major scale unaccompanied.
So you're the reason why the hills are alive with the sound of music.
What's the key to happiness?
Can you play Piano Man?
You know John, this isn’t what they meant when they said, ‘being high makes you more creative.’
Do you happen to know "Climb Every Mountain"?
Can you throw me a chord?
I don't know that one either. Have you any other requests?
I always add travel time to the tuning charge
So this is what you meant by performing at your peak?
So, you made it to the top. Carnegie Hall not good enough for you?
Could you keep it down up here? Thanks.
Play something light and airy.
Would you happen to know a good piano mover?
Will you please keep it down? It's much louder than you think downstairs
Maybe it's not writer's block. Maybe you've just reached a plateau.
Sorry. Wrong mountain.
Don’t stop on my account.
The keys to life? Try the other mountain.
Is this the final crescendo before the peak?
I'd like to suggest a different location for next week's lesson.
It's going to have to be a duet. The cello and viola never make it past the crevasse.
This is great. I have a singing telegram.
Your agent called to say you'll still have to perform.
Because it's there? That's my reason, too.
Shoot! I forgot the tuning hammer. I'll be riiiiiiiiight back.
No, really! The part I heard was very good.
Let me guess...Practice, practice, practice.
The folks at basecamp ask you to get that thing tuned.
Bad news, Doug. Base camp ran out of Schubert.
I lost my ticket. Can I still attend?
Hey, you're going to have to move your piano. I'm opening a coffee shop.
I understand that you give lessons
Hello...Its me
I knew the hills were alive with the sound of music.
The guys at base camp can’t sleep—know any lullabies?
Whatever you do, don't clap!
At last —-the secret to true High Fidelity!!
Why yes , I do need a page turner.
You up for a duet?
Oh sorry, I was looking for the woodwinds.
They don't make sherpas like that anymore.
I just came to let you know, your Cartoon Caption Contest lost again
You don’t make the payment, then we take it back.
You'd better be as good a teacher as they say.
Just wanted to let you know I can't make this week's lesson.
Play something uplifting......quick!
It's for entertaining. You have two questions left."
Did you say with or without sugar?
Do I know The Meaning of Life? Hum a few bars and I can fake it.
Bob - I said we were going to scale a mountain, not do scales on a mountain.
Would you please keep it down!
The same way you did...practice!
“You’re late, my concert is over”.
Play me some inner piece.
I can only play the high notes.
The meaning of life? No. The meaning of a bachelor's degree in piano performance? Sure.
This better be one hell of a lesson!
We have a tough enough time with the tree falling in the forest, and no one around to hear it.
The co-op board is getting a lot of complaints.
I'm told you're in tune with the universe.
Oh, thank heavens! I've had Bach's Concerto in D Minor stuck in my head all day.
Where on earth did you find a piano mover that does walk-ups?
I'm the new piano player. Sorry it took me so long to get here.
Up here, you've got to B# or Bb.
You may not like the price, but you won't find another piano tuner around here for a thousand miles.
I started playing stairway to heaven but only got halfway.
What happened to the harp?
I heard you were in treble . . .
Your playng seems to have reached a plateau.
I’d say your musical talent has plateaued.
When you said you like to be high when playing the piano, this isn't what I had in mind.
Uber dropped me off at the bottom, so there will be an extra charge for the tuning.
We're putting the band back together!
It looks like we've both reached a plateau.
Of all the Himalayan mountaintops in all the world....
I can’t believe you’re refusing to play “Climb Every Mountain” for me.
I thought I heard The Sound of Music.
The secret to life? Practice. Practice. Practice.
Sorry, but the orchestra is going to be a little late.
Did you bring a tuning fork?
Hi, I’m here for the four hands piece.
Hello, I'm Doug from Acme Piano Movers.
I hate to ask but do you know,Rocky Mountain High
Mr. Gould I presume?
Ok then. What is the meaning of B flat?
Really! No cover, no minimum?
Was it you whom I heard playing?
They didn't tell you about the lift on the other side?
I'm not sure we agree on what it means to scale the mountain
Just to let you know, The Yeti on the next ledge down has kids and when they don't get their nap, their behavior is abominable!
I take it that the hills are no longer alive with the sound of music.
The origin of cartoon pianos falling on people’s heads has been discovered by a lone climber. More at 11.
Oh... this is where those free falling cartoon pianos fall from?
You were supposed to come in after the first 8 bars
Sorry, but I'm here to repossess your piano.
Sorry but can you tone it down a bit. The neighbors are complaining.
Sorry. Wrong mountain.
I heard you reached a new plateau in your music.
If you're looking for directions - I say, practice, practice, practice.
Hey! Do you mind? Some of us are trying to sleep down there!
Can you play 'On Top of Old Smoky'?
I guess we could both learn to improvise.
The hills ARE alive with the sound of music.
Does that include delivery?
Swami, how I love you, how I love you, my dear old Swami!
Andante was fine for coming up. How about allegro for going down?
Man, I could really use some Stairway to Heaven right now.
I see that your music has taken you very far.
Oh, good, you're here. Now we can play Chopsticks.
The meaning of life? No, but if you hum a few bars, I catch on pretty quick.
We seem to have hit a plateau.
Enlightenment? No, this is entertainment!
The loneliest? I thought they said Thelonious
Are you the guy that needs a piano tuner?
Trust me! End it on a high note.
Don’t tell me I just missed your peak performance.
You could say that I have plateaued.
Oh no, I forgot the tuning fork.
Your neighbors ask that you learn to play something other than Chopsticks.
I hope you're here to tune it.
Don't tell me, you want to take your music to a higher plateau?
Philosophy is $20.00 per hour, but piano lessons are $30.00.
When I asked you to play 'On Top of Old Smokey' this isn't exactly what I meant.
Mountovani, its me Van Climbburn.
I heard the hills were alive with the sound of music.
Did you pack a tuning fork by chance?
The movers are here.
Sorry, to interrupt. I was looking for the yodeling class.
OK. I climbed every mountain, forded every stream and followed every rainbow. So where's my dream?
Sure I'm impressed you have a concert grand up here, Anatoli, I'm just surprised it's a Yamaha. I had you pegged as a Bösendorfer guy.
I heard there was a secret chord.
Excuse me, do you know where I can find the fiddler on the roof?
The tuner sent me. Said it only plays the high notes.
I knew I heard “Stairway To Heaven”!
Do you take requests?
Friendly reminder that you promised base camp no practicing before 9 am.
He asked me to ask you to play it again.
Oh, that’s grand.
I can't play a note. But I'll bet it caused Amazon Prime to rethink their business plan.
For the love of... Elton! Just retire!
You called for a piano tuner, right?
Would you mind taking it down a notch?
Have you seen a small dog missing a collar?
Are you still looking for a page turner?
Why, yes, I am a piano tuner.
How can you tune a piano, but not tuna fish?
Do you know "Ain't No Mountain High Enough
You're too late for your lesson.
So let me get this right. You didn't want the piano?
The others want to know what time rehearsal starts.
Could you keep it down? I’m trying to yodel.
That was A major scale.
I want the name of your mover.
Did you forget the sheet music again?
Can't go down till I finish the unfinished symphony.
The downstairs tenants are complaining again.
I'm just here to provide some atmosphere.
Oh this? In the service elevator.
I just need to rest for a minuet.
I'm here for my annual lesson
Oh God, I forgot my tuning fork!
Did you call for a tune-up?
I think you need to go one octave higher.
The commute to these piano lessons is a bit steep.
Did you bring the sheet music?
I no longer take requests for "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."
Hi, you're looking for an accompanist?
Oh darn! I forgot my tuning fork.
Every single request - CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN
So, the hills are really alive with the sound of music.
The remainder of the orchestra should be here in the next six hours.
Hey man, are you OK? I was only hearing ADELE songs from this mountain the past few days.
Bill, the Woodwinds are waiting for you at Base Camp.
Let me guess... You write your best stuff when you're super high?
Namasté Maestro, I’m a seeker, a climber, a persevering rhymer…yes, I confess, I'm a lyricist.
It’s nine o’clock on a Saturday, the regular crowd rushes in....
When I heard your career had reached a plateau, I had to see it myself.
Turns out getting it up here was the easy part
Wow, you play at a very high level.
I heard that you take requests.
Meaning of life? Nah, but would you mind telling me the name of your mover.
Can you play 'Rocky Mountain High'?
You say the only key to a long life is B natural?
It's the only rent I could afford that would accommodate a piano.
It’s not you, it’s the acoustics.
Is it true you're gonna get down tonight?
You missed a note.
Where does the pool table go?
The Ad said Cello
I ordered an upright piano
It should stay in tune for months. Yodel if you need me.
Do you mind, we're trying to sleep?
Finished yet, Mr. Schubert?
Say, do you know "Climb Every Mountain"?
"Do you know the Meaning of Life in B flat?
Master, I've thought about it a long, long time, but I still don't get that 'tune a fish' joke...
I'm sorry, I stopped taking requests for "Stairway to Heaven" 20 years ago. Would like to hear something else?
My ideas seem to be coming out of thin air.
‘You’re late for your lesson,again!’
I'm Bach-packing through Europe.
You came Bach!
All I want to ask is the name of your movers.
Congratulations you made it. Let me tell you kid it's pretty lonely at the top.
Wow - playing the Grand Canyon Suite on your grand piano at the Grand Canyon.
Fancy a duet?
Are drinks still two for one or did I miss Happy Hour?
When I asked for you to show me your peak performance, this is not what I meant!
No my son. Rhapsody isn't blue.
Sorry I'm late for my lesson!
You called for tuning?
Anything but "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"
Forget the meaning of life. How did you get that up here?
Perhaps You would prefer writing a few more commandments?
This stairway to heaven was a lot tougher than I imagined.
Sorry. I don't take requests.
Not Al, the pianist. Alpinist.
You think I'VE plateaued?
... oh, and your feng shui is all off too.
What do you mean 'I just missed it'?
Mom told me to tell you, "It's dinnertime."
Yes I take requests
I have a request.
Sorry--do you want a moment to compose yourself?
You need an idea? You should build a stairway to here.
When you called me to tune your piano, you did realize I charge for mileage, didn’t you?
I'm here for my lesson
I can see that you’re old and have magnificent instrument, but some of us in the canyon are trying to get some sleep. Can you try meditation for awhile?
Oh grand one, what is the key to life?
The remaining members of my team request that you stop composing in B flat.
Do you happen to know "Climb Every Mountain"?
I'm thinking a little early Gershwin after a long, vertical ascent.
Aw, com'on Sam, play it!
Hey Dad, Mom wants ta know if you'll be home for dinner??
I know it looks like I've plateaued, but I'm going out on a high note.
Can’t compose a symphony out of thin air.
Do you know how high we are?" "No, but if you hum a few bars I can play it.
The key to happiness? F major.
Do you teach? I play, but I've reached a plateau.
Mom says dinner is ready.
Sorry I'm late. My GPS said to take a left at the glacier. There was no glacier.
Either you play Rocket Man or you can carry that down yourself.
Keep it down, will you?
Who called for a piano tuner?
No, the New York Philharmonic strike ended in 1973.
You forgot the candleabra?
No, I won't play " Climb Every Mountain. "
Finally! I’ve been waiting a long time for those damn lyrics to arrive!
Maybe you need to reconsider what taking something to new heights might really mean!
You're too early ... Happy Hour doesn't start 'til 5:00.
So this is what makes the canyon so grand.
If you want to wait, the sherpas should be here with the string section any time now.
How'd you get up here wearing sandals?
Your audience just hasn't found you yet.
Wow!.....and I thought this backpack was heavy!
Bad news, Dad -- the bank is coming for the piano.
Upon reflection, I suppose I could've gone with a harmonica instead.
Was there some animals you had to leave behind to get this on the Ark?
I'm with the Musicians' Union."
Steinway really delivers.
While you're taking a breather, sir -- any chance I can interest you in a U.S. Cabinet position?
Of all the zen joints, in all the towns, in all the world, he walks into mine…
Sorry, I only tune Steinways.
You called for a tune-up?
As your agent I really wouldn’t worry about overexposure, unless you mean winter.
The most dedicated piano repairman award goes to...
I wasn't planning on staying up here so long, but this thing is a real pain to move.
Sorry, but I don’t take requests.
And to think they all said not to pack that metronome.
The meaning of life is play it by ear.
Why did you stop?
I'd like to request "Rocky Mountain High" for Sheila.
Ah, Tim the Tuner. What kept you?
I was told there'd be a band.
CAN YOU PLAY, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCKING ON HEAVENS DOOR?
Stairway to Heaven, please.
Geez, talk about nosebleed seats....
I should have asked for better directions to Carnegie Hall
Please don't play elevator music
At my age, it's easier to stay and play than it is to get up and leave.
If you're looking for enlightenment that's two mountains down.
If you can't explain the meaning of life, then can you teach me to play "Heart and Soul"?
What do you mean you can't play "Climb Every Mountain"?
Whaddaya mean you don't know "Climb Ev'ry Mountain"?
Huh. I was expecting a harp.
It's lonely at the top.
Hey buddy, could you throw me a chord
"From the top" has another meaning Carl.
Dammit. Can you point me toward bass camp?
That's funny, I thought the view would be grand.
I changed my mind...I do want anchovies on the pizza.
Mind if I play through?
My expedition ended on a high note.
Come on, just for me, 'Rocky Mountain High',
No, I don't didn't climb all the way up here to discover the meaning of life. I came just to ask how you got that thing up here!
Elvis?
You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish. Next!
Still unfinished?! I'm resigning as your agent.
Hey, is your job offer for a page turner still open?
Yes.. I'm Mike from "MountainTop Piano Movers" to give an estimate.
Finally, a piano bar with some real atmosphere.
Yes sir, we can move your piano down the mountain in seoncds, but first you’ll have to sign our damages waiver.
Are you the one that wanted his piano tuned?
Mr. Michaelson? Your Amazon order has arrived.
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.
Hey, could you keep it down?
I picked up the gin but they were out of tonic.
When I said high-pitched, this is not what I meant.
I was seeking the secret of life, but I’ll settle for ‘Climb Every Mountain’.
This is the last time I’m tuning your piano.
They told me the most important thing to remember before an avalanche was to stay composed.
Schubert! I'm looking for Nirvana.
Can you turn it down a notch? We just put the baby down.
You order a tip jar?
Why here? It's easier to hit the high notes.
Mr. Grofé, your Grand Canyon Suite makes us feel as though we´re actually there.
Please stop playing "Free Fallin' "!
It was a trek, yes, but where there's a will, there's a Steinway.
They wanted me to tell you no more Elton John.
FREE baby grand piano: free piano for a good home. a few keys don't strike, but overall great sound. pick up only. must be able to move it yourself. piano bench included.
Did you place this Amazon Prime order?
What's the meaning of life? Good Question. Better Question: How did I get this piano up here?
I'm here in answer to your Craigslist ad for a page-turner.
You may ask only one question and by the way, I don't take requests.
leave me alone, i'm decomposing...
Oops, forgot my tuning fork!
I think my career has plateaued
"Feelings?" Really??!!
Is this the bass camp?
I came here to get away from critics like you.
Is it ok if I sit in?
No, sorry, I'm a harpsichord tuner. It's still a funny coincidence, though.
...play like nobody else is listening...play like nobody else is listening...
Of course it needs tuning again. You're above the frostline.
Look, they're getting impatient. Let's just go with 'a note to follow 'so'.
So this is where you’ve been Haydn.
Would you like to hear something with just the high notes?
Put out a tip jar instead of sulking.
So... you play it 'because it's there'?
Will there be an intermission?
I was guaranteed one refrain from "Stairway to Heaven."
Amazon Prime.
I'll be damned ... the original keyboardist of Herman's Hermits!
I'm Haydn up here.
Stairway to Heaven?
So you're OK? From what we heard, you were decomposing up here.
Could you give me the name of your piano mover?
Pandora was right--there are no artists similar to you.
You were supposed to scale the mountain, not play scales on the mountain.
Are you sure this ticket is for next week's performance?
Don't worry, your work will sell better when you die.
What do you mean, you don't take requests?
Does it only play high notes?
May I use your bathroom?
Maybe I should come back after you get your act together.
Did you remember to bring the sheet music?
If you play "Night on Bald Mountain" one more time, I'll go nuts.
I'm so glad you made it. I've been looking forward to my lesson.
What do you mean, you forgot your tuning fork?
They had different sizes of piano wire. What size do you need?
Pachelbel's Canyon?" "Indeed.
Not the stairway to heaven, I presume.
This is the last time!!!!....I'm going to teach you how to tune yourself!
Any chance you brought a kazoo?

We’re trying to sleep down here!
I'm from the moving company.

How about next time we jam at my place?
It's hopeless. Bring me a Steinway!
Looking for a fella goes by the name of 'Mountain Piano Guy.'
For the last time, can you please stop practicing after 10pm?
I knew it begins with a single step. I didn't expect it to end with Chopsticks.
I took your advice to 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain'.
The question you should be asking is, "How did I get this damn thing up here?"
Julie Andrews was right all along.
I offer no sage advice but I can carry a tune.
I hope you brought a pen.
Dad, please. Come home. I promise to practice.
Oh great, an agent, just when my career has plateau'd.
The work order said 'Yamaha tune-up.' I brought spark plugs.
Dang. They told me this was karaoke night.
I had treble with the clef
Man, I could use a pick me up tune.
This lesson had better be worth it.
Have you been waiting long?
You really need to get another booking agent.
Come on, you must know this one - climb every mountain. No? The hills are alive? River deep, mountain high? What kind of piano player are you?
No, I don't know "How to Splint a Broken Leg." But if you hum a few bars, I can fake it.
Nirvana schmirvana, we're putting the band back together.
All it needs is a bridge.
Here's a tip - be more accessible
"The Meaning of Life?" I'm not familiar with that one...maybe if you hum a few bars.
Enlightenment? No, I'm the piano tuner.
would you keep it down?
No. I don't know the way to San Jose.
You’re taking the soloist thing way too far.
Finally, the piano tuner ?

Oh thank god you’re here, this thing’s so out of tune.”
They told me you would be here.
The meaning of life? Hum a few bars and I'll play it.
Please don’t tell me the concert is over !!!
But why even try to set your new commandments to music?
I take it your composing has reached a plateau.
Do you mind if I yodel?
Rats. I almost brought my cello.
I thought it sounded a little flat up here.
Your neighbors are complaining about late piano playing.
Is this the hall of the Mountain King?
I feel your pain, dude. I'm pretty sure you were sent up here for Ten Commandments, not Ten Concertos.
It was then Ned realized—there was nowhere on earth where one could escape from the Piano Man.
Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain" please.
Oh shoot, which mountain is guitar?
You're on in five...
Could you play a few bars of "I'm Sitting On Top Of The World "?
Are you up for something four hands?
It's 9 o'clock on a Saturday, the regular crowd shuffles in...
Can you please stop playing Piano Man!
I think our lessons have plateaued.
You'll have to go back. Tell them I only use my regular piano tuner.
Dang! I was coming for violin lessons.
My playing seems to have reached a plateau.
I bet you get a lot of requests to play "The Fool on the Hill".
If you're not the piano tuner, just turn around and go back where you came from.
It seems we've both peaked.
I'm here fur elise.
I knew they were alive with the sound of something.
The record company sent me. I'm afraid I have some bad news about the music industry...
Too late now, but a harmonica may have been a better choice.
Please - less 'forte energize' and more 'mezzo lento' - your playing has turned this into an active avalanche area.
Do you know anything besides 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'?
So this is what you do to be in tune with nature.
I prefer music that's a little more accessible.
You called for tuning?
Was I playing too loud?
Makes sense why they call it Treble Cliff.
You called for a piano mover?
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is right behind me.
Hi, I'm the violinist. Where's the rest of the quartet?
No, the concert is next month
You don't know "Climb Every Mountain?"
I don't know about "meaning," but the key to life is B-Sharp."
It's quarter to three. There's no one in the place but you and me.
Just a reminder that your rental contract ends this month.
No genie, I didn't wish for a great PIANIST.
Do you know "Climb Any Mountain?"
Which one is the key to happiness?
Now you know, my son, why they call the canyon grand.
You're late for your lesson!
Wrong mountain, kid. I can't even finish my own symphony.
Could I have 2 tickets please? My wife’s running late
The guys at Advanced Base Camp are requesting "Freebird" again.
Are you available for weddings and bar mitzvahs?
It’s not you; the acoustics up here are awful.

So that’s why the hills are alive.
You're going to have to move. The third glacier on the left has melted and your resonance is all off.
No, I'm not the piano tuner.
Sorry to bother you, sir. Will you sign for next door's package?
Were you the guy that called about the bad damper peddle?
So you're saying, the secret of life is Duke Ellington?
How about Climb Every Mountain?
Could you play something enlightening, please?
Summit’s an octave higher, pal
Thank God you're here! It's been so hard to get a good tuner on the weekend.
Did I leave my keys up here?
I’ve finally got you a booking at Carnegie Hall!
I'm here to repossess the Steinway.
Could you please not practice after 9 pm!?
Hey! I'm trying to sleep down here
Why, yes, I am available for children's parties.
Well, in this case, it really is 99% perspiration.
So there are 88 keys to the universe?
Well, the New York Philharmonic rejected your symphony. Said you haven't been dead long enough.
Yes, it's a walk-up, but do you have any idea what recital halls rent for these days?
I'd know that tune anywhere.
Billy's worst nightmare. Another Piano Man request.
Hey! Airbnb guaranteed me A Flat.
It's 2 o'clock. You said you'd be here between 9 and 11.
I'd like to see the size of your Sherpa.
I just needed a moment to compose myself.
Getting here is half the battle. Getting in tune is the other half.
I'll call if it needs another tuning
Play ain't no mountain high enough one more time before I go.
Well if you're not going to practice I'm not going to keep paying for the lessons, grandpa.
Here's your sheet music.
That was great, but how do I get TO the Hall of the Mountain King?
Well, I was told you had your own tuning fork.
Nothing stops the repo man.
The boys down at base camp are all in the mood for a melody.
Just a gentle reminder that we'll need it Thursday.
When you said you were going to get high and practice, I was expecting a more relaxing afternoon.
Hello there! I'm Albert, the piano tuner. You said the register seems too high?
Yes, the view is incredible...but just try & get a piano tuned...
I'm your creative muse. I got here as fast as I could.
Are you the tuner?
What took you so long? I called the piano movers years ago.
I don't know, it still sounds a little flat to me.
There is not a single candelabra available in town!
You're early. The recital's not until seven.
Do you know any Thelonias Monk?
I'm here for my lesson
You order a tip jar?
I'm disappointed. I expected a harp.
Meaning of Life? I dunno, I'm still trying to begin my Beguine.
The restaurant? That was weeks ago.
Play it again, Sam.
Next time you drop your sheet music, we’re going to use a drone to resupply you
The neighbors complained about the noise.
How ‘bout a little, “Ain’t no mountain high enough”?
How long can you stay? It's lonely at the top.
Yes, when all your answers are showtunes, they sound sarcastic.
I came all this way, so I hope you take requests.
Please! I am decomposing.
Sorry; I'm on break.
Can you please quiet down?!
Come back later, I’m practicing.
I came all the way up here for answers, and you were just making it up as you go?!
Moses, you’ve tried your best but the Ten Commandments just weren’t meant to be a jingle.
How high am I?
Sorry to end on such a low note, but I'm the Repo Man.
Did someone call for a piano tuner?
I was told there would be a quartet.
I have come a long long way to hear a really high C
I guess it's true - the hills really are alive with the sound of music!
I know how you feel. My kids don't like my taste in music either.
Do you know the way to San Jose?
Ok, then play Melancholy Baby, not Climb Every Mountain.
I'm looking for the lost chord
Do you have your ticket?
The reverb is amazing up here
What's the key to life? There're 88.
Thank you! I'm here til Thursday
I would've much rather preferred "Stair Way to Heaven" than "Rocky Mountain High."
Excuse me did you call for a piano tuner
Can you play, or is it just for show?
I'm here to tune your piano.
You're early again. It's still unfinished.
Sorry, I don't do requests.
No sir, There's no way you've peaked artistically.
You know, that's a thought. Maybe I will learn to play this thing someday.
Can you help me? I’m in search of a lost chord.
Why? Because it was here.
Oh ... and Disco is dead too.
I'd like to make a request: "Stairway to Heaven"
I got tired of all the requests for "Piano Man."
You can come down now, people don't like Kanye anymore.
Do you have a ticket for tonight's concert?
Who’d you expect, Liberace?
Your webcam viewers are tired of watching you pee over the side.
To be honest, I was expecting something a little more profound than "Chopsticks."
How about a few "bars" of John Cage's 4' 33"?
The people want more hymns.
Sorry, I just finished my final set. Come back tomorrow a little earlier.
Groupon or walk-in?
Play it, Sam. Play, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”
The other gurus are asking you to keep it down.
No, I don't answer questions. But I do take requests!
I came as fast as I could. That piano's not going to tune itself.
My wife asked me to move it out of the house
All about the atmosphere huh.
Finally! The piano tuner! What took you so long?
I still don't know why you needed a page-turner in the first place.
Come down already Billy! You'll never top Piano Man.
Whew, what a climb. Hope you're the guy who ordered the tuna.
How did you even get that up here? "I used the stairs"
It has to go back. I ordered the harmonia.
Oops. I forgot the tuning fork.
Still trying to hit the high notes, Maestro?
No, I don’t give lessons.
This is the last time I offer to help someone move.
What do you mean, "Who's Billy Joel?"
Sorry. I’ll be right back. I forgot my tuning fork.
I was hoping for the key to life. You’re really offering all 88?
Did you bring the last movement?
Next time we yodel a cappella.
Can you play Misty for me?
Hi, I'm Jesse from Uptown Piano Movers.
I was hoping you would be the piano tuner
Let me guess: you want to hear "Rocky Mountain High."
Sorry, but I don't do requests anymore.
Are you the one who called a piano tuner?
Is John Cage's 4' 33" the only piece you know?
The movers were fabulous.
Your venue gives a whole new meaning to the term 'High C'.......
I'll take requests, but nothing from The Sound of Music.
Did you yodel for a piano tuner?
Are you by any chance a piano tuner?
Mom says you can come back home if you've learned something other than Chopsticks.
What's the key to happiness?
Excuse me but do you take requests?
Well of course it is. Everyone knows you can't wring enlightenment from an upright.
The good news is I've been sent to help -- the bad news is I'm just the lyricist.
I thought there were harps in heaven...
Your ad said $500 for the piano. how much to deliver?
I'm with the woodwinds. The percussion section is right behind us.
So that's what happened to Billy Joel.
I am the piano tuner. Sorry it took me so long
Can I please have my piano back?
Sorry but I got here as fast as I could......now, when did you say it was last tuned?
Can you play something uplifting?
Oh dear, they told me it would be a Steinway!
I was told it was an upright!
I was on my way to Carnegie Hall, but I must have plateaued.
I, too, was surprised to learn that ‘Chopsticks’ is the way to enlightenment.
I've been waiting forever. It's sooo out of tune.
Is this the way to Carnegie Hall?
I can't Handel the weight of this Bach pack. Can i treble you for some help?
Nice try but there will never be another Grand Canyon Suite.
I'm just looking for the bathroom
Grand Pianos? I thought these were the Grand Tetons!
Let’s get you back to bass camp.
I'm not old, just decomposing.
'Looks like you peaked a long time ago'
Are you kidding me? You've never looked better, Mr. Joel!
I think the acoustics were better on the other cliff.
Are you accepting new students?
Word is you need a banjo player?
Sandwich? I was told you needed a tuner on high.
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT TAKING ANY NEW STUDENTS THIS YEAR !
Hammerstein, I presume?
There must be a simpler way to elevate your performance.
Looks like I have reached the crescendo
Do you know any Billy Joel songs? Also, is there a bathroom nearby?
"The valley people just filed a noise complaint".
Do you have your ticket?
Aw cheer up, I bet more people would come to your recital if the venue was a little more accessible
Oh God, not again.
I thought I told you I... would be Bach.
Actually, this is how you get to Carnegie Hall....
Welcome to Zune, please register on the ground level with a valid credit card before requesting a song.
All that gear and you forgot the tuning fork?
Did you meditate for a piano tuner?
You the page turner?
Sorry I'm late; the traffic was a bear.
Alright sorry I took so long. You said you wanted your piano tuned?
So, is this the Treble Cliff?
I heard that you needed a piano tuner
Can you play Stairway to Heaven?
What's the key to life?
Morning! The piano tuner wants you to know he's still just searching for parking.
I'm sure this isn't what he meant when he asked you to take it from the top.
Really? You really think your most pressing need is a tip jar?
"Help me move" he said. "It'll be fun" he said. "I'll buy you pizza" he said
Amazon delivery...I believe you ordered two dozen tablets of manuscript paper, nine erasable pens, a case of gluten free energy bars and the latest Rolling Stone.
Your music is SO over the top!
There you are! I knew all that music wasn't just in my head.
I saw your help wanted ad in the New Yorker for a page turner
Did you bring a tuning fork?
Did you remember the metronome this time?
Why, yes, I am a piano tuner. Why do you ask?
Why did you stop playing?
We're going to need to take the legs off to get it in the truck.
The good news is you haven't peaked yet.
I told you when we started out, it’s a long way to the top if you want to rock’n’roll.
They said you were looking for a 'Chopsticks' partner
Now THAT was a major scale.
Oh, good, you must be the piano tuner.
How about a rousing rendition of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"?
So it’s past nine o’clock on a Saturday?
Because "I'm Sittin on Top of the World's" already been done.
Can you play, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough?”
Could you please keep it down? I'm trying to climb a mountain here.
That WAS you in the Sound of Music playing "Climb Every Mountain", I just knew it.
You were lookong for a tuner?
I'm just saying, "Climb Every Mountain" seems a little on the nose.
I feel like I have plateaued.
So, the hills really are alive with the sound of music.
No....I’m just a grandfather playing a grand piano in the Grand Canyon...
You must be the piano tuner. What took you so long to get here?
Oh, these are the Baby Grand Tetons. My mistake.
Do you know how to tune a piano?
A pastoral interlude, please. And Gatorade, if you have some.
Play it once Sam. For old times sake
Your tour locations are getting more and more inaccessible to your fans.
I'm sorry, your tickets were for last week
Huh, so the key to life is D minor.
Your Web-Site clearly says: "All Returns are Free!"
I'm sorry you don't know how to play the piano. Luckily you ordered it from Amazon so you can send it back and get the harmonica you always wanted.
Are you the piano tuner?
I take it you need help with descending scales.
They say they want it back now.
Wow! The hills are alive with the sound of music.
This was A major disappointment, but only A minor setback.
your career has plateaued
Do you know any Billy Joel?
I'm more interested in the "how?" than I am in the "why?"
Would you care to accompany me on the climb down?
Perhaps you'll do better if you change your altitude.
Let me guess, you thought you'd play all the time but now it's just a piece of furniture.
Am I too late?
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.
You needed someone to play 'Heart and Soul' with?
What piano?
I'm sorry -- I'm looking for Mr. Walther, 2pm, Intermediate Banjo.
I saw your ad on Craigslist and came right over.
Now that's how you end on a high note.
What do you mean, you don't play?
I see you have mastered the scale.
Sorry I'm late for my lesson - maybe I need to leave my house a day earlier.
Any chance you could play a few bars from "Climb Every Mountain"?
Now all we need is a drummer
Sorry...I'm looking for the violin playing guru.
You really need to work on the bridge.
They want one more re-write. Can you enlighten it up a bit?
Your Mother says you are to stay until you get it right.
Thank God! Finally! The tuner?
It is hard to find descent music around here.
I thought I heard an ascending scale.
Is this the piano you wanted to have tuned?
Mr. Steinway, I presume?
I got this idea from my doctor, he does organ transplants.
Can you give me the number of your piano mover? I’m in a 4 story walk-up.
I don’t know the way down but if you hum a few bars I can fake it.
Please sir, what's the meaning of li...HEY! My Steinway!
I was really hoping I'd find you in a burning bush instead.
I hope you practiced this week!
And then it just hit me. This is not how you get to Carnegie Hall.
The sherpas want to hear Climb Every Mountain again.
Any chance of a major lift?
My journey along the path to Enlightenment now ends knowing what has 88 keys and no locks?
I'm sorry! I can come back later if you're busy.
Don't ask.
Life? Life is grand.
Let’s make a deal. I’ll listen to your six-hour symphony if you let me tie my rope to your piano.
Where's the guy with the Alphorn? This is the third mountain I've tried.
They called my compositions too lofty.
OK, so exactly how long has it been since the last tune?
I wondered why the hills are alive with the sound of music.
Can't you go somewhere else to practice?
Do you know 'She'll be comin' around the mountain'?
What do you mean you didn't call for a tuner?
Oh...that makes more sense. I thought the hills were alive with the sound of music
I hope I'm not late for my lesson.
Tell me that fat lady hasn't made it up here yet.
No, it's fine, really. We'll be happy to take it back.
You came all this way for a noise complaint?
Ultimately, you will have to find your own Steinway in life.
There are no 'three wishes.' It's either total enlightenment or 'The Entertainer.'
Sir we only take requests through our app.
I'm really sorry to be late for my lesson.
Yup, I'm the fat lady, I'm here to sing
How's the jingle coming?
If I've told you once I told you a thousand times, there are people trying to get some sleep down here.
What is the meaning of Legato?
Please tell me you're the tuner I called
Do you have a minuet?
I'm from the moving company you called. Where do you want the piano?
I always thought it was the angels and their bowling balls.
Nobody had seen the piano man since 1973.
The Piano Man, I presume.
Sorry, the concert ended 20 minutes ago
I'm terribly sorry, sir, but we delivered to the wrong address.
It’s cruel to play Stairway To Heaven.
Finally! The piano tuner! What took you so long?
The fact that you got the piano up here is inspiring enough!
So what do you do for fun?
No, I certainly did not order eighty-eight tins of tuna.
The piano does not come with the flat.
Why, it's the old man and the middle C!
No! I prayed you’d listen at the summit not play Listz on the summit.
Never reached your peak huh?
'Yeah, you've reached the career plateau.
Slight snafu. Do you have your own tuning fork, per chance?
You play with a very elevated sense of style.
I forgot the sheet music.
Play 'Misty" for me.
Sorry; you missed the show."
Do you know "Melancholy Baby"?
It's not that bad, all you have to do is tune it, the other guy carried it up.
I hope you aren't offended, but this will be my last lesson.
Off peak performance, huh?
There's really nothing to it. All you have to is hit the right keys at the right time and the piano plays itself.
If you think getting a piano up here is difficult, you should try writing a good song!
“I agree, the guidebook description of ‘a grand view at the summit’ is misleading”.
Son can you play me a melody; I'm not really sure how it goes.
Oh God! Please stop playing that piano.
Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
What happened to the restaurant that used to be here?
Of course it's a Steinway.
Apex Moving Service, here. We can take the piano but you will have to get down by yourself.
Open mic is NEXT week.
That was breathtaking!
Yeah but the darn thing has been out of tune for three reincarnations.
Well, at least the view is grand.
"I'm sorry I don't know "Stairway to Heaven". Can you hum a few bars?
I’m a piano tuner, not a magician.
I had a conductor, but he was struck by lightning.
On second thought, how about, 'Stairway to Heaven?'
You ARE wise. It is easier to travel with a flute.
Quick! I need help with ascending scales!
Everyone down in base camp wonders if perhaps you know any other movie scores besides Koyaanisqatsi.
I'm here to tune your piano.
Are you the one who requested a piano tuner?
Please. Stop.
Wasn't this a cafe just last month?
You called for the piano moving estimate?
Do you need an agent ?
Oh no - the AirBnB is next door.
I seek the answer to lif...... how did you get this piano up here?!?!
Other than the acoustics, it’s a grand venue.
No, I am not the tuner
Something about this place strikes a chord.
I'm not Sam and I'm not playing anything again.
The neighbors have been complaining.
The climb was the easy part. We're learning Liszt today.
Repo man!
I heard you take requests.
I've tried everything, what's that song that goes 'ba ba da ba bum'
Nope, I am not a mystic. I'm from the order of the Thelonius monks. Can't reveal great truths or inspire inner awareness but I can play a mean version of Round Midnight.
You're late. Have you practiced this week?
The tuning is reasonable but the clock starts running when I leave the house.
Did I miss the crescendo?
May I request 'Climb Every Mountain?'
I do have a request...could you give me a hand up?
Im the piano mover. Where we takin’ it?
I heard you were looking for a vocalist.
Ah, enlightenment. For me, it was when I could play Beethoven and Liszt perfectly as long as no one else was listening. Now, go away.
No one will believe you.
Sorry, did I catch you at a bad time?
You said you wanted to study at a top music school.
Is the key to happiness a major or minor?
My students have to really want to learn to play.
The villagers say that if you play 'Misty' one more time,they are coming for you with torches and pitchforks.
Thanks for meeting me here. You can see for yourself, it's a bargain for the price. You'll have to take care of shipping, though.
I'm the piano tuner. Can you enlighten me as to your problem?
Steinway?! Steinway's the answer?
Mom says she can still hear you, and she's trying to sleep.
Irving! Come home! Your piano teacher is sorry about the criticism.
Must be quite some time since your last movement.
Darn. I forgot the tuning fork.
The acoustics here are horrible
I have a request.
What do you mean I'm late!!
She says to start without her…
Billy Joel? Is that you?
Listen, it was only metaphorical. The hills aren’t really alive.
That was you playing the whole time? Really annoying, man.
Piano tuner? I said Panini, tuna.
Your ad said, 'same day tuning - no waiting', or it's free, right!?
The piano tuner said that you have to meet him half way.
Apparently I've reached my level of incompetence.
I knew it! The hills are alive with music.
No, but if you hum a few bars I'll give it a try.
Maybe your expectations are too high?
Do you mind? That’s a bit distracting.
Do you mind? I’m trying to sleep down there.
Please limit your playing to daytime hours.
I'm enjoying the lessons, but since you moved the commute has become quite a trek.
What the FUCK are you doing here
Do you have five minutes to talk about elitism in the arts?
I brought the viola.
I'm practicing my scales.
Same time tomorrow for our next lesson?
UPS - "we'll deliver anything, anywhere."
So, all I have to do to reach enlightenment, is go back and get you a tuning fork?
I’m terribly sorry, but I can’t remove the echo!
The secret to life? Remain well composed and learn to improvise.
it's not the secret chord anymore, is it? thought you were soooo special didn't you?
Ah, at last, the relief yodeler and now I’m outta here!
Could you please keep it down I'm trying to climb here.
Do you know, "Rocky Mountain High" by John Denver?
I brought the piano duets.
At last... I have found the Abominable Showman
Can I change seats during intermission?
Venue choice, Herman... That's the key
Why does everyone ignore the stairs in the other side of this mountain?
I hope you brought the lyrics.
I think I've finally hit my plateau.
No. I don't know "Top of the World" - and no, I don't want you to hum a few bars.
I feel as though I've hit a plateau too.
Talk about ending on a high note.
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind...
In retrospect, this was not the best location to busk.
Franz! It's finished?
Wow, you really took piano playing to a whole new level!
Yes, I'm absolutely certain that the location surcharge is not included in the $49 Piano Tuning Groupon.
I hear that you're seeking a lyricist.
Have I arrived at a truly classical moment or just another bad yogi joke?
Will you play it NOW, Sam?
The Yeti is requesting ‘A lot less Gershwin.’
Ask me to play anything except "Ain't no mountain high enough"
Is this the observatory conservatory?
If you get a little better, maybe they'll let you play in town.
There is no meaning of life. Anyway, here’s “Wonderwall.”
I think we’re going to have to start charging you for shipping.
Well, maybe it's just that you've reached the peak of your career.
I have to ask you to keep it down. The Yeti are complaining.
No, I don't know "The Way to Nirvana", but if you hum a few bars, I'll fake it.
You play "Climb Every Mountain" with such feeling.
Not bad,.. but I think we should try it just a little bit higher.
I'm looking for a guy that called for a piano tuner.
Did you bring the tip jar like I asked?
Are you any good at turning pages?
How do you THINK I got the piano here?
"I thought we'd end this journey to enlightenment on a high note".
Thelonias?
"Ain't No Mountain High Enough" in key of G. Hit it.
I don't do requests if that's why you're here
Where's mine ?
Yes, the keys to life are ivory.
Can you play 'Climb Every Mountain'?

I never dreamed I'd find a vintage Steinway for $500!
Finally! Do you know “Heart and Soul”?
Can't you play something a little less uplifting?
No, a Bosendorfer is not the same as a Bechstein. I brought the wrong parts.
Are you the guy who sent for a piano tuner?
I'm sorry, a piano bar is not my idea of heaven.
I realize your tuning appointment window was from 1987 to 2017, but the traffic was terrible.
'Any requests?'
Everyone agreed you need a tune.
Maybe something other than the theme to Jaws would be appropriate?
I'm here for my piano lesson.
Bach, is it you?
While I AM in search of harmony, I could do without the melodies.
Are you dreaming? Well, let me ask you, did you climb EVERY mountain?
Could you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?
" There was a restaurant here a few weeks ago".
I've come to hear your peak performance tonight.
I cannot find the high notes
Hello, I am from the peak next door. Do you mind keeping it down?
I am not your father; but can you tune a piano?
Oh, finally I have enough for a concert. You're the third guy this month.
Ready for your lesson?
You the guy needing a piano tuned?
Good thing you dont play a wind instrument.
Did you call for a piano tuner?
I thought I heard music!
Have you considered a vow of silence?
My spiritual guide called and said you needed a tuner.
I hope you're the tuner.
Where should I park the truck?
My piece has reached its plateau.
You better have brought the metronome.
Not bad, but the pitch is a little high.
You want the meaning of life? Can you hum a few bars?
It's not the actual tuning of the piano that I dread. It's just that these tuning forks are so damned heavy!
Oh. I thought this was Grand Pinion Mesa.
No, Jeff. You can't come down until you finish your scales.
I'm sorry but there was just no way I could bring the drum set
Could you play a little quieter please?
I'm here as the attorney for the valley residents.
Could you please turn it down a bit?
The lyric you are looking for is "I get by with a little help from friends, ooh I get high with a little help from my friends". Simple and catchy.
Where's Julie Andrews?
Once more with feeling
Do you take requests? Because I have two.
Do you have a special request
The rest of the band was wondering: When did you decide to go solo?
Did you get my request?
So, you've had trouble finding a tuner?
I only tune organs.
I like your high notes
Tuner here. Sorry I'm a little late; my GPS was down.
No consultations today. I’m feeling a bit decomposed at the moment.
"Meaning of Life?" Doesn't ring a bell, but if you hum a few bars...
Huh. I thought God played guitar.
The meaning of life? Hum a few bars, I’ll see if I know it.
I understand you're searching for the lost chord?
Finally! The upper range is a little out of tune, the damper pedal sticks, and the voicing is off. Oh, and did you remember the breath mints?
Could you keep it down up here?
I'll tell you right now , the altitude will affect the tuning.
And I thought they called it grand because of the view!
If you're the tuner, I want you to know I don't pay extra for travel.
All I'm saying is you could've helped a little.
Im sorry but we just don't do Steinways.
Have you considered distance learning?
Am I too late?
And on the eighth day, God reached a creative plateau.
The dueling pianos are two mountains north.
“So, the high C is sticking?
Your complaints about the acoustics here have been noted.
If you hum a few bars of climb every mountain, I'll try to play it.
So, you are finally here for our duet!
I don't care where, our roommate contract said no playing after 8 pm.
They call me the "Clef-Hanger". But, you can call me, Steve.
I hope you have some songs in your backpack -- I can't get sheet music delivered up here.
DID YOU CALL TO HAVE YOUR PIANO TUNED?
You made it! Now it's your turn.
So you DON'T do requests?
And you think your backpack is heavy...
Whew, trying to find a close parking spot was really hard.
Let me guess, Heaven and Earth Moving Company?
When they told me that the Piano Man was at the top, I was expecting Billy Joel.
I assume you saw the poster.
Hey, you're littering.
Play Stairway!
How about Piano Man?
I suppose it would be out of the question to ask if you just happened to have a tuning fork?
So where do you draw inspiration from?
Mom says come home and give techno another try.
The village is bored with classical - they want contemporary jazz.
I'm sorry. I just sold this one two minutes ago. Would you care to browse our sandal clearance section instead?
Well you used to rock, but it feels like your career's plateaued.
Did I miss my cue?
Schoerder, you have aged well and your piano has really grown!
No I don't know "Rocky Mountain High," but if you hum a few bars I can fake it.
A lovely composition but the end left me hangin
Is there an encore?
The piece has a nice melody but could use more atmosphere.
What key?
I'm sorry, your ticket was only good for yesterday's performance.
Enough classical! Play On Top of Old Smokey.
Chopsticks? That's all you've got?
Good news: we found the lost chord .... the bad news, it’s now owned by Facebook.
I was told you have the key
I hear you're looking for a lyricist.
Play something I can yodel

You're a little flat.

The hills are alive with the sound of you being flat.
Could you keep playing while I climb down, just for dramatic effect.
Mom says dinner's getting cold...
I found the lost chord
Seriously? It's after 10pm!
At last! I've come to deliver your streaming revenue.
Next time there’ll be a travel surcharge to tune the piano.
I decided the commandments needed a sing-along.
Please tell me you know how to play something besides Chopsticks
As your publicist, I think it's time to admit that prolonged exposure to solitude and altitude has not overcome your "Composer's Block".
The hot dog cart is on the other mountain.

I could hear the wobbly B flat from base camp!
People are complaining that the hills aren’t so alive anymore

My way - or the Steinway.
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in...
Sorry, I've just got a harmonica.
Was it a major scale?
How did I get on top of this mountain? Practice.
Dont play it again Sam.

I wanted to achieve a peak performance, but seems like I’ve been waiting decades for you to come tune the darn thing.
So, what's the key of life?
"Climb every mountain, again?" Isn't there another song I could play for you?

Yes! I've got the words!
Sorry, I don't know "Misty
Welcome Bach.
Still trying to play Beethoven? Me too.

You're finally here. It's so hard to find a piano tuner these days.
I hope you're not working for tips.
Can you turn it down?
My apologies but I was delayed at a lower altitude by a string quartet!
"Meaning of life?" No clue. "Key to life?" I'm your guy.
Take a number.
On second thought, I'd rather have the piano on the ground floor. Would you mind taking it down for me?
Play it, Sam. Play "Climb Every Mountain." You played it for her; you can play it for me.
I need the directions to Carnegie hall

So that's why they're called the Grand Tetons!
Nice try, but it’s not Nirvana.
Your agent's on the phone...
Very good. Now, take it from the top.

Wait...you're not Led Zeppelin. How am I supposed to get to Heaven now?
I didn't know hermits played show tunes.
Apologies, didn't mean to interrupt your composition of "The Ten Commandments -The Musical"
Let's face it, every good boy deserves favor.
"Do you know the Meaning of Life in B flat?
So would you play "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" for me?
It's an unfinished piece.
So tell the truth: How many notes are supposed to be in a Mozart divertimento?
They sent me up to tell you if you keep playing this loud, the piano will beat you down the mountain
Excuse me, I think I lost my keys...
Will you please learn to play something other that “Chopsticks”. You are driving us all crazy down there.
What took you so long?

There must be a misunderstanding. I said I was in search of the lost gourd.
I know it's time to face the music.
I'm here to let you know the piano tuner is going to be late.
Of course not! When the ad said, "Heart and Soul Required," I didn't know you were referring to sheet music.
Oh crap, I left the sheet music on the dash...
They say music can take you to another place, but they don’t say anything about it bringing you back.
Good morning sir. I'm the piano mover.
Sorry, I don't play requests.
I was told you'd relieve me ten years ago!

Can you teach me how to play "Heart and Soul"?
Is this the hall of the Mountain King?

It's hard for the fat lady to sing when there's no music

I know I’m just a Sherpa. But next time, how about I write the music and you carry up the piano?
You won’t believe who I met atop the last mountain.

Just like your teacher said, the answer is Practice!
Is it always that flat?
Serenade ... now.
Liberace?
Moses plays the piano?!
They were out of pencils.
The moment Roger finds out the lesson is about more than the piano.
Who were you expecting? Rockmaninov?
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, Mr. Manilow.
Before I go....... could you play me out?
Did I miss the show?
I thought the program was "Two pianos, four hands."
I was hoping for Rachmaninov, not Rock Man Enough. Uggh!

Will you play “Hall of the Mountain King”?
Maybe a minor lift before a major fall?
. . . I need to charge my phone

I knew it sounded flat.
But I gotta warn you, I don't like classical.
Well, I have to go, but have you considered "Piano man"?
Is this the way to Carnegie Hall?
Don't ask.
This explains how you stay so composed.

What? No theme song?
You should be grateful! This is the highest paying gig I have ever booked for you.
So this is what reaching your peak looks like.
I just have to ask, are those Chacos?
What--a false summit?
Just what I thought before I started climbing: it's all about harmony.
Are you the one I’m supposed to tell it on the mountain?
I was hoping to hear some Rock-maninoff.
More piano, not so forte. There’s quite an echo in the valley!
I hope you like "Chopsticks".

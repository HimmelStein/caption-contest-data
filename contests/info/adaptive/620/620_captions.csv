It's not the end of the world if he misses.
Most of them have candy, this ones filled with nuts.
Are you sure the boss is cool with this? It took him six days to make.
The best part? Not a single religion predicted this one.
Somehow I always imagined Judgement Day would come with a little more gravitas.
But what is the string attached to?
These young guys have it easy. It was much harder back when it was flat
Lower it a bit, Mar-a-Lago's just coming back around.
It's been 4 billion years. Just hit it already!
And to think they're worried about global warming
It was a biblical typo.  It's really called the "Rupture."
Blind Fate gets two more chances.  Then it's Dumb Luck's turn.
The last time he connected, it killed off the dinosaurs.
Every time Trump tweets, an angel gets its swings.
After this, let's pin the tail on Uranus.
If he hits it he's in for a big surprise.  I understand it's two-thirds water.
This is taking an eternity.
It's the Big Bang, minus the theory."
It's ok. Most of the damage has already been done.
America First.
I don't want to wait in line. Let's do the Saturn ring toss.
At this rate, mankind will beat us to it.
Jesus, Haley's comet gets closer than that.
He should be pretty good at this.  He used to play for the Angels.
Do you think Trump will blame this on Obama too?
Hark! The Hearld Angel Swings!
If we all miss, then the Meek get it, as is.
And to think they’re worried about climate change.
God doesn’t play dice.  But man, he loves the piñata.
I always get a laugh when I hear their Teutonic plate movements explanation.
Well, it was already hanging by a string.
Hark, the herald angels swing.
Usually it just causes a minor flood or earthquake, but one time we did wipe out the dinosaurs.
He died before he could finish the job at EPA.
They probably think there’s a scientific reason for all this.
I hope it’s tied on tightly. Last time he knocked Pluto out of the solar system.
I heard it's not filled with candy, it's filled with nuts.
Don't get your hopes up.  He hasn't connected since the dinosaurs.
This guy couldn't hit Jupiter
I hear it's full of plastic crap made in China.
Today's Tuesday, November 8, 2016.  Why do you ask?
No one ever thinks it's going to end this way.
And on the 8th day, we partied.
Little known fact: Every time Donald Trump tweets, an angel gets its swings."
Admit it: This totally beats dancing on the head of a pin.
That's how we make wind. Wait until you see how rain happens.
Getting warmer.
The last time he connected all the dinosaurs died.
If he actually hits it, we’re going to see a lot of new faces around here.
Wait! Wait! He's been impeached!
Some of them thought it would end with a whimper.
I thought we were going to wait, and give the mid-terms a chance.
Here comes another Big Bang.
We thought we would combine Armageddon with a festive event.
Swing and a miss. The Angels are down to their last strike.
Don't you think they've had enough this year?
And to think they’re scared of climate change.
If I knew he batted left I would have put the White House on the other side.
You know, I'm not sure Pruitt should be up here.
And on the eighth day...
Not so omniscient with the blindfold on, is He?
We're going to call it "The Big Bang".
In a minute all hell will break loose.
It's the end of times, we might as well have some fun.
It was either this or pin the tail on Uranus.
Had I known that this is what passed for entertainment up here, I probably would have cheated on my spouse.
He won't hit it.  This is all just to scare the Baptists.
They think earthquakes are caused by fracking.
If he smashes that thing, all hell will break loose.
It's okay.  It's empty now - used to be filled with hopes and dreams.
He trained at the Environmental Protection Agency.
I'm no theologian, but this just doesn't seem right.
I just didn't expect that this is what we'd do on the 8th day.
It's not like they were taking great care of it.
I hope they don’t blow themselves up before it’s my turn.
Einstein was right. God doen't play dice with the universe
We keep score on the Richter Scale.
Actually, I'm not sure if the Boss knows, but we ran it through legal and they thought it was fine.
I don't believe it either, but this is what they voted for.
When it splits open, all hell breaks loose
They were just going to blow it up anyway.
If Trump is reelected, the blindfold goes.
And they're worried about global warming.
Is that Scott? Nah, Pruit does it with his eyes open.
Two to one God's still pulling the strings and he misses
Originally it was flat, but it was too hard to hit."
I always feel sorry for their theologians after our parties.
He’s working in mysterious ways again.
No way am I putting anything from that in my mouth.
Bob is a klutz.  My money is on global warming.
Yes, a lot of things have changed around here since we got a Pope from Latin America.
He's been getting closer ever since the election.
He only said we couldn't flood it again.
I love when Judgment Day falls on a Taco Tuesday.
The last time he connected, we lost the dinosaurs
Two bits says that Trump busts it before he does.
Hit along a fault line or they'll get suspicious.
he's Trump's foreign policy advisor
Of all the apocalyptic scenarios, I bet they didn't see this one coming.
I used to think He had a plan.
His name?  Scott Pruitt."
Down there on Earth it goes by many names, the Rapture, End of Days, the Second Coming.  Up here, we just call it Fiesta!
He's been getting a lot closer since 2016.
Now up to bat - - R. Mageddon!
You think he can get it done before Trump does it?
If Trump wins again, the blindfold comes off.
I expected that actually "playing God" would be a little more imaginative
It was this or "Pin the tail on Uranus."
Do you think they know it's all a game?
The whole idea of this game is to knock some sense into it."
Seems unnecessary.
They were overdue for a mass extinction event. We just wanted to make it fun.
Well, it's getting warmer.
2016...2017...2018...
The spin coming out of  Washington, D.C. makes it almost impossible to hit!
We're hoping if he hits it hard enough, everything on earth will go back to normal.
It's filled with nuts.
It's all fun and games until somebody loses a continent.
I can't wait to hear how they report this on NPR.
Last time we tried this, Trump got elected.
Are you sure that we should be doing this? He just spent seven days working on it.
It will create a terrible mess but on the upside no more tweeting.
I just pictured something more elaborate when Stephen Hawking said, "The end of the world is nigh."
We might as well destroy it before Trump does.
The last time we played this game we lost the dinosaurs.
This is the way the world ends.  Not with a bang, but a wiffle.
I wouldn't worry too much, there are billions of these things floating around.
They'll never know what hit 'em.
Are we taking this string theory thing a little too literally?
Just told him that Jeff Sessions quoted Romans 13. He's swinging for the fences
He said a flood wasn’t enough this time.
Here comes the Big Bang.
I don't know why we bother with this game. They're doing a good enough job on their own.
Now this is fun. Remember when it was flat?
Has it really been 66 million years already?
We've tried floods, pestilence, wars, nothing seems to work. So why not this?
If He asks, Satan did it.
It's allowed under the loosened EPA rules.
They really have no idea how insignificant they are.
I wish the anti-science folks could see this!
We put Scott Pruitt inside.
The last time we did this Trump was elected.
Eternity sounds like fun at first. Then boredom sets in.
God help cartoonists: left hand over right is not right.
Who gave Justice a bat?
He's training for a job at the EPA.
I always thought it would be global warming.
There are no bad angels. There are only bored angels."
Seems to me they’re doing a pretty good job themselves.
God said we should have fun before putting it out of its misery.
Earth was always a hit or miss proposition.
You know, it's not the real one. That's already ruined.
You were bored with earth quakes, hurricanes, floods,  fires and Trump?
When this guy was done with Pluto it wasn't even a planet.
Don't worry--Yankees can't get in here, and Cubs can't hit it.
The last time he won, the dinosaurs went extinct.
We got tired of waiting for an asteroid to do it.
It's been 4.543 billion years - maybe it's time someone else got a turn.
If you ask me, it's not an extinction event without cake and ice cream.
I told him it would break itself if he just left it alone.
No fair hitting below the equator.
Taking a blind swing at the world is popular on Earth right now.
So this is how the world ends? I would have never guessed.
I don't like this. The big guy spent 6 days making it.
WOW !! And he's one of our batter angels. !!
Wow!  He said he was mad at the world, but I figured he'd just post something snarky on Facebook.
What can they expect, putting everything in the Cloud!
You should've been here when he knocked Pluto out of the park.
Honestly, the way its going, the humans might get the job done quicker...
Metaphorically speaking, it's God's way of saying that his button is bigger than Trump's.
And on the 8th day, they had a party.
It's called Trump Ball but no one knows the rules.
I don't even like the molten center, it's just the sport of it for me
That planet has always been hit or miss.
65 million years from now they'll think it was an asteroid
I hope it's filled with Skittles.  The last time it was filled with these big lizards with sharp teeth.
If this thing explodes on it's own, I don't think that should count.
It's a small world, isn't it?
And scientists think an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs.
He wants to beat Trump to it.
Make it look like an accident
One good whack and they’ll start believing in the big guy again.
Yeah, the world's going to end, but....CANDY!
They'll probably never know what hit them.
Thank God we only play this every 66 million years.
What is Scott Pruitt doing here? I was certain he was headed to the other place.
After Trump’s election, the Old Man said, “Sure, what the hell, take a swing.”
The fallout should be interesting.
Why do you think they call it the Big Bang?
We're hoping for chocolate but it'll probably be plastic.
The treats will be out of this world.
The last time he got a really solid hit was 65 million years ago.
I only needed one swing to take out the dinosaurs.
It's been ages since anyone actually hit it. It just makes a big bang.
Like the world isn't whacked enough already.
Global warming was taking too long.
Says his name is Scott Pruitt.
If he ever hits it we'll be swamped with immigrants.
Last time we did this only a moon came out.
He's celebrating becoming head of EPA.
We should probably step back. It's mostly water.
It’s the least of their worries.
Plan B is Donald Trump.
Floods are so Old Testament.
This could be interesting. The last time anyone hit it there was only one Continent!
I think we're missing the point of Earth Day
Who does he think he is? Scott Pruitt?
He couldn't hit Jupiter.
It contains mostly nuts.
He said that he had an Earth-shattering idea.
He gets one more swing and then we will just let climate change do its job.
Hark the angels swing
Oh, since about November 2016."
We’re trying to spin it back to 2016.”
Maybe we could trade him to the Saints.
It's been 4.6 billion years - can we go home?
It is not as much fun as Pin the Tail on Uranus.
It’s the new Big Bang theory.
Inside are joy, lust, rage, shame, depression, narcissism, addiction, crazy, lazy, pity, apathy, stupidity, civil war, raging hormones, political gridlock, toxic masculinity, and Mexican candy.
God's giving bonus points to anyone who hits Mar-a-Lago on the first swing.
Swing ... and a Myth!
Two more misses and he's going back to Congress.
Even having the world on a string doesn’t help.
You really don’t want to know what is inside, but I would step back.
We may be here awhile--he used to play for the Mets.
Let's face it, he's only on the team because his dad owns the place.
Didn't Trump already break it?
Somehow I always thought Fate would be a more profound process.
We made sure everyone was dead first, right?
We're down to like eight or nine planets; maybe we should play something else on your birthday.
Why even bother? They're doing well enough on their own.
It's like whack-a-mole but with consequences.
Next we’re going to bob for forbidden fruit.
What are you hoping for--world peace or Snickers?
Its no more random than Trump, so we thought “why not?”
Yes, there was a moon. His aim is terrible
The boss says it's a dud, so we can do what we want with it.
10 bucks says he hits San Francisco again...
We'll show them Divine Intervention!
If he makes solid contact, it'll be earth-shattering.
It's about to get crowded up here.
Looks like T.S. Eliot was wrong.
Getting hotter
We had one of these for God’s birthday and the humans called it the “Big Bang.”
It's not full of candy; it's full of nuts.
They will blame it on climate change.
How did you think the earth rotates?
God knows we do this?
This is how we test for blind faith.
Last time all we got were dinosaurs.
So I take it God's not coming back.
We were saving this for later, but with the current rate of global warming, all the candy is gonna melt.
I usually like pinatas, but I'm pretty sure this one's full of nuts.
The last time we broke it only single cell animals fell out.
Fuck it. They deserve it.
It is a small world after all.
What on earth do you think is inside?
Pinata?  We've been calling it 'fracking'.
Oh for heaven sake ... its a metal bat against a magnetic field so why is a blindfold necessary?
He's in for a huge disappointment when he sees what spills out.
I always thought it was pronounced 'rapture'.
I love how they keep thinking it’s a meteor.
It's not a metaphor.
Is this really how we should be celebrating Earth Day?
This seems redundant. Aren't they doing this themselves?
Let's face it.... he couldn't hit Jupiter if they put it on a tee.
I can't wait for pin the tail on Uranus.
I hear that's how Trump presides over the USA - blindfolded to the facts and comes out swinging.
That makes it a full count for Blind Faith
Management decided that global warming was just taking too damn long.
He doesn't take his smiting as seriously as he used to.
This is really going to confuse scientists.
Now you know what makes the Earth go around.
It's ok.  They'll think it's a hoax.
On my birthday it was full of dinosaurs.
I bet it self-destructs before he hits it.
The last time we played this, the cutest little dinosaurs spilled out!
I keep telling him to swing low.
For a righteous God, He has a wicked sense of humor.
Not so much the Angel of Death as the Angel of Passive Aggression.
Remember when the phrase 'getting warmer ' wasn't ironic?
They think it’s something to do with tectonic plates.
One of our batter angels
And, you're sure the Boss said this was OK?
After this, we'll dance on the head on a pin.
There must be a better way to knock some sense into the people!
One small swing for man.....one giant miss for mankind.
Last time he hit it,we lost Atlantis...
Am I the only one who remembers what happened to Mars when we did this?
It's a preemptive strike.
We do this every year on His birthday. He thinks it's hilarious."
I hate the way HE pulls it up just before we swing."
The Big Bang
Betcha five bucks all Hell breaks loose.
He's calling it 'The World Series'
This is how we move heaven and earth."
What's the worst that could happen?
Justice is blind but she sure packs a wallop.
This way, the Boss has plausible deniability.
I don't know what it's full of.  But, I have a theory.
Wait until you hear how scientists explain the random occurrence of earthquakes
That's Nature- he bats last.
They'll just blame it on climate change.
After this we play pin the tail on Uranus.
Amazingly there have only been five mass extinctions.
Wait, what is it hanging from?
Don't worry about it. If he fails, it isn't the end of the world.
This game takes forever.
He's never been the same since he was assigned to Scott Pruitt.
And that's a miss. But they will be wondering what is happening to their ozone layer.
Making heaven great again.
And to think they're so concerned about asteroids.
Global warming?  No such thing.  It’s the pinata effect.
The good news is God pulls it up every time she gets close...
If he hits it, Trump will blame Obama.
Last year it was "pin-the-tail" on Uranus.
There he goes, playing God again.
He’s trying to beat the record time set by Trump and Pruitt in the early 21st century.
The fact that he's missed for centuries might actually be proof that prayer works.
This may take a while. On earth he was an Oriole.
We got the idea of 'Whack a World' from watching the President.
Piñatageddon
Thank goodness  he only hits it once every 5 million  years
It's for their own good.
We figured, what the hell...
I think they're probably expecting this anyway.
Well, so much for having the world on a string.
Expect mostly plastic.
Joke's on him. The center is mostly iron and nickel.
This is going to take eternity.
Yeah, no one saw this coming. We thought sure it would be by fire.
Just don't tell him it's really full of lava.
And now you know how the fault lines got created.
Should we wait for God? He loves this game
Instead of candy it's full of nuts.
I love election night!
I'm betting that the humans will destroy it before he even hits it.
Now it really is a World Series!
He's so pious. He misses on purpose all the time.
Don't get your hopes up. It's filled with nuts.
He figured that he’d do it before Trump did
I miss dancing on the head of a pin.
Three to one he only hits water
Scott Pruitt throws the weirdest parties.
At this point, what’s the worst that could happen?
I thought an apocalypse would go down more easily with a festive touch.
Who said justice isn't blind?
They'll blame it on fracking.
He should aim for the United States.  They need a good spanking right now.
Who's turn is it to be Trump next?
The last time we played this they lost the dinosaurs.
Do you really think this is a good way to celebrate Earth Day?
Think he’ll get it before Pruitt does?
Warmer...
Well, it won’t be candy.
He was part of Trump's EPA.
He hasn't hit it once in 4.5 billion years.
I don't remember doing anything this earth-shattering at my quinceañera.
It's the latest cloud app.
6 thousand, 4.5 billion. All I'm saying is it's someone else's turn.
It’s full of Mars bars. He wants the world to know He’s angry, but He still has His sense of humor.
Shouldn't God answer some prayers instead of wasting his time holding the rope?
I'm not sure this is how to make the world great again.
This year it’s filled with chaos.
Do you think he will knock some sense into it?
I hate being on earthquake duty.
Just imagine their disappointment when they realize we said rupture, not Rapture.
His name is Apocalypse. He usually misses, but he's been getting closer lately.
You think we should tell him it's full of crap?
This is heaven so he gets four strikes.
Not bad, but he's no Donald Trump.
The Big Guy said to tell them it’s “the Trump Effect.”
I'll bet you ten blessings that the humans destroy it before he does.
If he hits the ocean, we're going to be drowning in plastic bags!
Last time? You would have loved it! Those dinosaurs? Everywhere!
It’s not quite how I pictured the Apocalypse.
So much for a whimper
Don’t we have better angels?
I keep telling him he's not gonna want what's in there.
It’s the end of the world, as we know it.
Is this one of those "Make Heaven Great Again"  activities?
Warmer . . . warmer. . . . warmer.
I’m tempted to remove the blindfold.
All yours—I’m allergic to nuts.
We got permission to start over, so we are having fun with it.
The last time he hit it the dinosaurs went extinct.
Can't be worse than November 8, 2016.
I hear he swings both ways.
Who knows, it could be an improvement.
We only let Halley take a swing every 75 years, but he's getting closer
Even when he makes contact, the only thing that comes out is lava.
Donald Trump is the only one I can think of who could do it blindfolded.
Can't be as bad as what they're doing to it
Don't act so offended. It's not like you made it.
We all remember what happened to Pluto.
Clearly not one of our better angels.
The Boss has pretty much given up on this one, anyway.
About as close as The Angels are gonna come to a World Seties this year
I hope he keeps on missing.  That thing is polluted.
God's not dead, just indifferent.
If he hits it, it's gonna get a lot more crowded up here.
What happens in heaven stays in heaven.
They'll never even know what hit 'em.
He was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
It's a new way to smite...still in beta, though.
I wonder why everyone keeps hitting Washington DC?
We're going to Hell for this.
His exact words were 'Why am I having all these people from shithole planets come here?'
God says it's totally trashed, have at it.
This is the worst bachelor party in eons.
We get one swing every time he tweets.
Thank God Justice is Blind
In a literal sense, Einstein was right about God not playing dice.
He’s been at this since January 20th 2017
I thought it was supposed to end with a whimper.
All he does for the seventy-five years between swings is train but somehow Halley still manages to miss every time.
Last time we hit it the dinosaurs died.
I bet it's filled with nuts.
So THAT'S what makes the world go 'round.
Come on flatten it!
. . . . and they’re worried about asteroids...
We were all surprised to see Scott Pruitt here
Can you believe the last time we did this was 65 million years ago?
If you think this looks hard, wait 'til you try dancing on the head of a pin.
It is our new foreign policy.
Jesus Christ, hit it.
Ironically it's stuffed with Mars Bars.
Make the Universe great again.
If he connects, it's six more weeks of hurricanes.
It's not even filled with candy. It's just a bunch of nuts and flakes.
I still can’t believe Pruitt ended up here.
Well, the idea is that it can't make things much worse.
Does Father know about this?
If  he manages to hit it, we’ll blame Trump.
I still feel guilty about the dinosaurs.
Luckily for humans they don't know their future is hanging by a string.
If this one's filled with hot gas and magma too I'm going home.
You should have seen what fell out of Uranus.
I miss this game.  We only play it every 65 million years.
In life he was known as Donald Trump.
In 4 billion years,the closest he's come was 60 million years ago.
It seems redundant but I'm in heaven. And I've got the world on a string.
After this we’re gonna play Pin the Tail on Uranus.
In Hell it's the same game, but no blindfold.
I prefer pin the tail on the comet.
There's gonna be hell to pay when dad finds out !
Talk about hammering home a metaphor.
People in Hawaii hate when we do this.
I wonder what they do in Hell for birthdays?
Whack it again ... some of those folks down there still haven’t gotten the message.
The humans have nothing to worry about, this guy used to bat for the Mets.
I had to get it custom. Took the man upstairs six days to make the damn thing.
No one can hit the damn thing. It's like it has a magnetic field or something.
What the Hell is it hanging from?
Things seemed to be going downhill fast, so the Big Guy just figured "What the hell."
This game didn't start until the Trump administration
Every time he misses it's not the end of the world.
Because we can't play dice with the universe any more.
We'll be here for an eternity at this rate.
You remembered to fill it full of candy instead of 39 billion cubic miles of molten iron and nickel, right?
And they thought global warming was a problem.
Good thing we have an eternity.
Too bad.  He was trying to beat some sense into it.
Everything’s left - his swing AND what he swings at.
And humans think love makes the world go round.
I'd rather swing on a star.
The last time? About 65 million years ago.
I always thought the apocalypse would be more religious based.
The big man is starting over, so he let us have a little fun with the old one.
Remember when there were guardian angels?
Last time, he wiped out the dinosaurs.
They'll blame Global Warming
Don't worry, they'll just think it was an asteroid.
Why else do you think it was created?
This guy can't hit the broad side of a planet.
Hark the herald angels swing... and a miss.
He's even worse at the ring toss around Saturn.
If I hit hard enough, maybe I can knock some sense into them!
A flood worked better last time
What they'll refer to one day as the Big Bang.
you would think an angel could see through a blind fold
I was told there'd be four horses at this party.
They refer to it as "El Nino" when he bats lefty.
If this does not bring the Second Coming I don't know what will
This could take an eternity!
And they're worried about nuclear weapons.
Remember what happened to the dinosaurs the last time we played this game
It would be more fun if it were filled with candy instead of with petrochemicals...
I guessing if you're good at this you're probably in that other place.
He does know its filled with 5 gallons of magma, right?
Well this is much more fun than that dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin game we did back in the Middle Ages.
Of course, no one ever asks what the other end of the string holding it up is actually attached to.
Because we're fed up and couldn't think of a better way to get rid of it.
I hear he played for the Cubs.
This is more fun than just pushing the 'Re-set" Button.
It's been 500 million years.  It's about time for another calamity and mass extinction.
Not again. This is how we got Trump.
I hope he knows it has a molten core!
It's all fun and games until everybody gets hurt.
Global bashing is more fun than global warming.
There's definitely gonna be hell to pay if he makes contact.
The last time he hit it, Trump got elected
It’s not like we didn’t give them plenty of warning.
Played for the '62 Mets.
In life, he was a president.
Best slugger on the planet. Off the planet -not so much.
Good thing Justice is blind.
Pretty close, Halley. You can tty again in 75 years.
Are you sure stick comes after water?  I thought fire was next.
At this point it's just a question of who destroys it first.
2000 years and he still holds a grudge...
This isn't working. Give them social media.
We do this once every four years.
I guess it is a little morbid for an Earth Day party...
He’s the dude that knocked Pluto out of the solar system.
Yes, we know nothing good will come out of it; that's why were using it for practice.
Now that’s a whole different ball of whacks.
Sometimes the world needs a little divine intervention.
What's next? Saturn ring toss?
World Series!
It's a wonderful afterlife - every time a bell rings an angel gets his swings...
This can take an eternity.
I'm not a big fan of his irony, but I do love candy.
Just watch.  As soon as it breaks, Jesus will swoop in here and take all the good stuff.
It could get crowded up here.
His last birthday party was an extinction level event.
I'm not sure how he got here. He used to run a hedge fund.
To think that they're worried about climate change.
I hope it's filled with dinosaurs like at his last party.
Last time we had a piñata at the company party we lost Pluto.
Tootsie Rolls and Dum-Dums, mostly. A few Smarties, if you're lucky.
Imagine all the sh**t thats gonna fall outta that thing
It wasn't going to last much longer anyway!
There goes seven days of creation!
So much for “the benign neglect of the universe”.
It's okay. Mr. Pruitt told us the more you damage it, the better it gets.
And that’s how the Earth ended up flat.  Checkmate, atheists
Wow! The Book of Revelation was way off.
I thought it would be nuclear war, or maybe climate change.
I'm betting a 6.2 quake in Wales with a tsunami chaser.
Somebody hit that thing before it melts on its own.
The Flat Earth guys are terrible at Piñata.
Another miss. I think we brought him up too soon.
Last time it was dinosaurs.
It's performance art. He's pretending to be Donald Trump.
Not exactly what I meant by "World on a String"
Earthlings call it divine retribution, but it's totally random whack-a-globe.
That's how he got to be a saint--by not telling Trump a piñata is Mexican.
If all of those crazy meteorologists only knew how hurricane season really happens.
Maybe it is a good time to just put them out of their misery....
He's a Republican. He will wreck it eventually.
If it breaks before your turn, it'll be Andreas' fault.
Tell me it’s just symbolic.
Ironically, they'll think it's an asteroid.
At least it’s not flat.
I wish he would just smote it already so we could move on to the cake.
« He really hasn’t got a prayer. »
He’ll get it. He’s just global warming up.
It's nothing they aren't doing to themselves.
This is so redundant.
Last time we did this, those dinosaurs were not thrilled.
The last time he hit it we were up to our necks in dinosaurs.
So much for "the whole world in his hands".
And to think the poor chumps will call it an act of God.
I had no idea this is what He had in mind when He was making it.
I’m afraid he picked up a lot of bad habits when he was Trump’s guardian angel.
I guess it doesn't end in a whimper.
I thought it was tectonic plates too...
Last time he played, he whacked Mars into retrograde with Venus and all hell broke loose!
And you are positive he said he wanted a World piece?
So we're calling this "The Big Bang Theory?"
The rules are simple: Every time the bell rings, an angel gets his swings.
We never question God's sense of humor!
The boss says he's through using a carrot.
Si.  It’s our contribution to making America great again.
He's 0 for infinity.
Climate change seems to be the more imminent threat.
I'm hoping he'll just hit Washington.
Scott Pruitt died and went to heaven.
Probably molten rock, but I'm hoping for candy.
It’s part of God’s Make Heaven Great Again program.
These parties would be a lot more fun if we were allowed to drink
I'm confused—is this a bang or a whimper?
You know what it's full of, don't you?
Funny, I actually died at one of these, now look at me
If God gets home early we run.
Wait for the fallout.
And those people on earth thought global warming was a problem.
Somehow I thought heaven would be different.
Do you think the Mayans are still checking the stats?
I hope there’s cake after this.
It's Kim's turn next
Hark, Harold the Angel’s Swing
And he wonders why he's always picked last for stickball.
I hope he likes nuts.
I can't believe no one's hit this thing yet.
You should hear how science explains this!
Believe me Gabriel you don’t want what’s gonna fall out.
They decided upstairs that this would be more fun than the Four Horsemen scenario.
See no evil..
And people think money makes the world go round.
Believe me; it's not candy that comes out.
Joke's on the creationist, it's full of lava
He’s auditioning to become Trump’s new EPA Administrator.
It's a metaphor, I think.
And that's how we lost the dinosaurs
Or,we could switch a few votes in Ohio and Michigan…
Well at least it will be quicker this time than 40 days and nights.
Well ,it had to end sometime...
Who said Republicans don't know how to have fun?
He really couldn't possibly make it any worse.
The last time we played pin the tail on Uranus.
I love these things! The Old Man makes 'em all the time
You know, if he hits it we will have to come up with another giant asteroid story.
It’s a performance piece explaining Trump’s foreign policy.
The last time someone hit that thing we had the Cretaceous die-off.
He can’t make it any worse.
They thought it was bad when Atlas shrugged . . .
He’s trying to knock some sense into them ... before it’s too late!
I gather he's never seen "It's a Wonderful Life"
Don't worry, with everything else going on down there, they won't even notice.
I guess Karma's blind.
It’s mostly made of water.
Nothing good is going to come out of it.
And they think global warming's a big deal?
Just a few degrees higher and it’s all over.
He'd better stand back cause I hear it's full of crap.
That's the problem with the cross handed grip.
Any day now.
We're celebrating Earth Day.
So there's hot lava cake inside?
Last time, he got the dinosaurs.
And it is filled with coal, asbestos and Necco wafers.
Do you think this is why we weren't given a halo?
That time we called it the Big Bang.
The asteroid worked better.
You wouldn't believe how high I had to fly to tie the other end
We'll just say it was a meteor again.
If he hits it, everyone who thinks they’re the center of the universe will fall out.
You get bonus points if you hit Trump Tower or Mar-a-lago!
This is the fairest way to decide where disaster strikes.
Better to make it quick and painless than letting Trump drag it out.
He hasn't scored a direct hit yet, but Hawaii is definitely feeling it.
Can he pitch?
What are we celebrating?
He messed up Pangea pretty bad on his last birthday.
He was known as "Pruitt"  before he arrived here. I'm told he had a real passion for this.
The Boss doesn't care when he misses, but I think if he says "Damn" once more he's outta here".
Trump taught us the game - but he plays without the blindfold.
He's been this way since Trump was elected"
The last time he connected, Trump won.
Looks like it's gonna be a really big bang.
Global warming. Hurricanes. Famine. If there's any candy in there, I wouldn't eat it...
God is NOT going to be happy if we break it
This may be why we don’t have halos
Is this your first hurricane party?
I heard if it breaks, the Presidency goes to Bernie.
And, so, the world turns.
Well, how did you think we keep in spinning?
It's a game, right?
Watch this......it is filled with hot lava.
How else are you going to spend an eternity?
Remember when we killed all those dinosaurs at Reggie's birthday party 65 million years ago?
Nice try, but Mother Nature bats last!
I hear the place is going to hell.
It's filled with supermarket plastic bags and plastic straws
The only rule is not to flood it with water.
I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out it's filled with molten iron
It's filled with regret.
Your father said to trust your instincts, Luke.
I still think that humanity will break it before we do.
Maybe this'll knock some sense into them.
More of our Mexican traditions we can keep up, less chance Trump will try to get in.
And they think the weather change is from fossil fuels.
After the latest EPA pull backs, I'm not touching that candy!
Well, at least they won't have to suffer through global warming.
This shouldn’t take long. It’s already cracked.
Hope he doesn't succeed. No telling what pollution we'll be exposed to.
They think those Earth quakes are random
'Wouldn't this make more sense if we had the capacity for irony?'
Oh, my!  We can't allow a "leftie" to demolish the world!
It's hopelessly infested with a virus, so we thought we'd have a little fun before we recycle it.
He hit it pretty good in the 2016 election.
They’ll figure out the Big Bang. They just won’t know how it really happened.
He’s been at it for six days. He needs to give it a rest.
If he connects, Trump can blame it on the Mexicans.
It's a non-diluvian alternative for a reboot."
Well, if he ever does connect, there's going to be hell to pay
Do you ever wonder what the better angels do at parties?
He's never been a people person.
We're nowhere near as good at this game as the people who still live there.
In the beginning it was paradise, now it’s a tear down.
High and inside again! He's going to get sent down.
You think he knows it's filled with molten rock?
You think Lucifer will get in trouble for this?
I can't see how this will make Earth great again.
I can’t believe he played for the Angels!
We told him if he hits it he can keep it
I was hoping for Mars, better candy...
What exactly is the theme for this party?
I don't know about you, but I'm not eating anything that comes out of there.
I didn’t think he’d take it literally when I told him that divine intervention is hit-and-miss.
Do you think he can take out Trump and Kim Jong UN with one swing.
As if he could do anymore damage.....
So much for the moon.
You know they play the same game downstairs, just without the blindfold?  There’s a metaphor in there somewhere.
Five bucks if you say' "Use the Force."
He thinks there's candy, but it's just full of idiots.
He is being traded to the Angels next season .
Looks like the Angles have no hitting again this season.
We used to use an aluminum bat, but Gabriel's first swing wiped out the dinosaurs.
Well, yeah. It WAS a donkey until the 2016 election.
God is from Mexico. Didn't you know?
Another Evangelical trying to bring on end-times
Picking up the pieces is hell.
Talk about catharsis.
It's a good thing one second is like a million years.
Wonder how long the chief will keep pulling it out of the way in the last second.
After the Flood Fiasco, we decided to try it this way.
Not only do they know about it, a surprising number of them are actually rooting for him.
THINGS WERE EASIER WHEN IT WAS STILL FLAT.
I think it's called Earth, or something.
He thinks he’s Donald Trump
Who knew the end of the world could be so random.
Devil's advocates aren't welcome at this party, Gabe.
I'd be surprised if anything good came out of it.
Relax. Those twits will blame it all on global warming."
Apparently this variant holds way more candy than the original flat concept.
If he only knew what it was filled with he wouldn't swing so hard!
See, I told you climate change is not caused by human activity.
I see Little Piñata Man is at it again.
God got creative with the divine retribution.
He's an anti-globalist.
Isn't there a less drastic way to rid the universe of Trump?
Last birthday, he cracked it open and a bunch of dinosaurs fell out.
Imagine how bad the weather would be if he actually managed to hit the thing.
He already promised He wouldn’t do the ark thing again, so we had to get creative
God gave us the pinata as a sign he would never destroy the earth with water again.
It's not what it used to be; we're thinking of doing away with the blindfold
Gonna be Hell to pay if the Boss discovers we used his creation as as a piñata
Last time it was filled with Dinosaurs!
I feel like Justice would have hit it on the first swing.
Last time we played, the dinosaurs went extinct.
It's filled with sinners.
The guy at the store promised me this brand has no intelligent life.
Wait ‘til he finds out it’s filled with nuts.
Tell Pete we’re gonna need extra staff at the Gates.
With swings like that this will take an eternity.
When the earth was the center of the universe this game was way easier.
You should have seen what got Lucifer kicked out.
$2 a swing... the new EPA "fundraiser"...
They were way past their worst-by date, anyway.
Chariot's sweet, but he swings low.
I hear it’s filled with hate, anger, despair, and distrust. What are you hoping for?
That's Casey; he was smug on Earth, too.
We started from a flat model but then we wanted to secure the edges and add more spin
It's just an exercise in blind faith.
Last time he killed the dinosaurs.
I call Hawaii.
I can’t Wait to see how the scientists explain this one
Oh, it's full of something all right, but it ain't candy...
He hasn't got a prayer
And the people who live there call it wind.  When we hit it they call it an earthquake.
Ha! They think they have a few billion years left.
Ah so it ends as it began. Not with a whimper but with a bang"
Everyone thinks this is the best option.
And they think an asteroid killed the dinosaurs..
Last week he caused an 8 on the Richter scale.
Michael is SO going to hell for this.
Don’t sweat it. It will self destruct shortly anyway.
This explains a lot
Time to let them know that they are not  alone.
If Gabriel doesn't get to go first, he acts like it's the end of the world.
He's good, last time we played he caused 2 earthquakes and  a tsunami in one shot"
Nobody's hit it since we stopped admitting Mexicans.
We can't do any more harm to the earth than they are doing down there.
End of life is always a hit or miss situation.
having promised to never again flood the Earth, God let the angels get creative.
Last time we played this, Trump won the election!
Can we please unblind Justice?
That's why the odds are ten billion to one - " no one knows the day or the hour."   You in?
Oh look. White guys are destroying the world. What else is new?
Jupiter was too easy.
Similar, but this one is called a Trumpata.
Ha! And they were all  sure it would be a nuclear holocaust.
The Lord just heard that "World On A String" song and it gave him an idea.
Yes, we are 'Angels in the Outfield'.
I've always said, "it's a small world".
It took seven days to make that.
There may be some lingering resentment.
Ha ha! Climate change theory, good one!
New game. Got it from Trump. It’s called diplomacy.
It was going to burn up anyway.
The last time somebody hit it, Trump was elected.
At this rate were going to be here forever
Don't worry. Trump will be here soon, and he can do it.
At least it’s better than last year when we bowled with it.
What?  You'd prefer another flood?
I guess this spells the end of the Meuller investigation.
Well, I'll be. I always though it was God bowling that caused thunder.
In the end, it just got too difficult to deal with.
After this we'll play pin-the-tail-on-Uranus.
It looks like blind is taking a swing at deaf and dumb.
Donald Trump's Spirit Guide.
Is this evidence of Divine Intervention,or just the Trump Effect?
This is faster than fracking for them. Plus it's more fun for us!
This game is way more fun than "Pin the Tail on Uranus."
It brings fairness to earthquake location.
If he hits it, all Hell will break loose.
If you hit it right on Mexico, candy comes out. But if you hit Russia, all you get are a bunch of hacked emails.
it was more fun when it was on Atlas' shoulders
The last time it was dinosaurs - I can't wait to see what we get this time!
I hear the book has a different ending.
The irony is it's empty....
Cheese was in their moon. What do you bet this one is only filled with hot air.
Frankly, I like this better than the long questionnaire"
At least we're not pinning a real tail on a real donkey again.
He is just global warming up.
It’s more fun than meteors.
That explains earthquakes.
Humans started asking questions, but then Dave came up with the tectonic plate thing.
Yeah, we had to make it round to fit the candy inside, the original is actually flat.
It may be fun, but we have to pick up the pieces.
Next we're playing pin the tail on the comet.
It was the only way to make it fair.
When he hits it, we'll all get Starbursts and MilkyWays.
I take it we're not the 'better angels'  Lincoln spoke about.
We should have let Babe Ruth do this.
It's how we explain global warming to conservative Christians
Bone spurs kept him out of the Bigs...
Believe it or not, he was the Angels' best hitter...
I thought we were supposed to be guardians...
I’m just not sure the new Activities Director gets what we’re about here.
We figure it's just faster this way.
I’m worried about Gabriel, Peter.
It worked with Mars.
Let's pray they won't know what hit them.
If it weren't for this obsession of His, there would be more planets.
The trick is to hit it on a fault line.
You cleared this up upstairs?
We got the idea from the G-7 conference!
Couldn't we just have candy whenever we want it?
If he hits it, all hell's gonna break loose.
It’s fair.  They can’t see us either.
Whack! Seven days' work down the drain.
Stand back.  If that thing breaks, all Hell's gonna break loose.
He just got passed over for the head of the EPA, Trump wanted someone with a better swing.
Last time we played, Trump ended up President.
Any thoughts or prayers before we start?
Is he practicing for an EPA interview?
Better hit it soon before they blow themselves up.
It ain't over 'til...well, eternity!"
I’ve heard it’s stuffed with Dum Dums.
We're trying out some new entertainment ideas for members of the Trump Administration.
Six days to create . Three minutes to destroy .
Cut him some slack - he was a pitcher in the American League.
The weirdest part is candy still comes out.
This game would be more fun if it didn't remind me of the Trump administration.
Is this really how the dinosaurs became extinct?"
It's chock full of nuts.
I think He is delegating too much.
The flat earth piñata didn't hold water, let alone candy.
Sure, there are Smarties and Tootsie Rolls, but mostly it is filled with trepidation.
This is a strange way to celebrate Earth Day.
He did promise not to do the whole flood thing again
¨This is for all of the flat-earthers out there.¨
Who will Trump blame when it breaks?
All hell will break lose if he ever hits that thing .
Hell if I know.
Something tells me this won't end well.
It used to be fun; now, all that falls out is plastic.
Probably dollar store candy anyway.
Let’s just say it won’t be candy.
It has been a while since the last big bang.
It just feels like he’s aiming for America.
This isn't even the biggest risk they face.
4.5 billion years of this and the last time he got close was the Mesozoic era
You know if you break it you open Pandora's Box.
At times like this I choke up.
You're sure they don't care what happens to it?
I think if we really want to destroy it we should just elect trump again
The newbies never win, the Boss keeps pulling up the string
I can never tell the difference between microaggression and healthy anger.
Luckily for earth his batting average is 0.071.
The Republican Party donated it in a fund-raiser."
And they thought it was about the science
Choke up, it's tilted on axis.
If any immigrants fall out they get to stay in America.
We tried mars, but the dust got EVERYWHERE
When it breaks can we get a new one?
Dibs on Sweden.
He couldn't hit a ball on earth either.
They stopped appealing to our better angels
Don't blame me.  I voted to let more women in.
Even in Heaven he still can't hit a curve ball.
Perhaps it’s time we rethink that ban on performance enhancing drugs.
It has more to fear from Trump.
Don't the people down there realize that there are no "natural" disasters?
Maybe we should tell him about the lava inside.
The last time we played this we made Hawaii.
Now I know why he wanted the world on a string!
Remember when we thought there was global warming?
Knock the hell of it!
The hard part is hitting it before it self explodes...
This is the way the world ends.  Not with a bang but a dum dum.
I bet Trump will try to keep everything for himself
He's not the first sightless superpower to take a swing at the whole world and miss the everything!
Funny how they think global warming is a threat.
That's what it always felt like, but I never realized that was what was actually happening
Gabriel is having some fun before it goes to hell.
They got tired of whack-a-mole.
I hope he nails it  .  .  .  it's gooey inside.
We can’t hit, catch, or pitch, so we’ll have to use our powers.
First one to hit Trump wins!
I prefer Frank Sinatra's version.
Don't worry, they'll never know what hit them.
Bro, the humans are much better at this 'destroy the world' game
Climate change takes too long.
These parties tend to fizzle after the big bang.
He's been swinging and missing for several millennia now."
Don't fool with Brother Nature!
This was easier back when it was flat."
A shower of stale hard candy and out of date chocolate is not the worst possible ending.
The "Divine Intervention" theme for this year's holiday party took a dark turn.
This might be a major game changer.
If he breaks it there will be Hell to pay
It's been 10,000 years. Can we have cake now?
No rush, we got all eternity.
They're both just warming up.
Rediculous, we all know REAL pinatas are flat...
And this is how the world ends.
Can you believe it’s been about sixty six million years since the last piñata party?
The dinosaurs disappeared the last time he hit it.
With a miss like that, you'd think it was flat.
And the humans think a meteorite killed the dinosaurs.
It's quicker, more merciful this way.
We're trying to break its downward spiral.
This is how the earth rotates.
George, stop, it's breaking apart on its own.
This is taking longer to destroy than I would have guessed.
He'll hit it soon.  His name is Angel and he is Mexican.
Expect a lot of water.
It’s not like they can get any worse.
And on the eighth day, He LOADED it with Skittles."
Yes, I'm a bit surprised he ended up here, but I was totally shocked when he was elected President."
Maybe we should just leave it at global warming
He did much better with the Asteroid Throw a few eons ago.
We were going to fill it with candy but the ice caps kept melting into it.
The last time he hit it we got a bunch of dinosaurs.
He apparently hated Geography.
If he gets any warmer, he's going to knock that ice cap right off the bottom--then all hell will break loose.
I know it seems unethical, but it is his birthday
I think it’s for the best.
Rumor is it's full of full of tears, disillusionment and Jolly Ranchers.
The sad part is, it's not even filled with candy. Just magma
The challenge is to smash it before it annihilates itself.
It's a choice of either having some fun with it today or watching it self destruct tomorrow.
Might as well have some fun before all Hell breaks loose.
Last time he hit it all the dinosaurs fell off....
Two hits, two volcanic eruptions. This guy is good.
The scouting report says he can’t hit the 70,000 mph curve ball
I liked the "pin the tail on the leader of the free world" game better.
Pin the Tail on Uranus is up next.
Don’t worry. He hasn’t made a direct hit for over 65 million years.
Couldn't he just sound the Last Trump instead?
And we thought the dinosaurs were surprised.
The shot heard round the world can't compete with this.
I’ll get to meet my great-grandkids.
Can we get him a bigger bat?
Well, at least that should be enough to get hurricane season started.
So hard to do without cursing."
Great... now Heaven will be eternally stuck with all of those plastic bags and straws.
Do you think we should have asked God about this first?
John is hitting out of this world, as of late.
He might not make Angels tryouts.
Well, he's got two wings but no prayer.
I bet that they pay attention to climate change after this.
When it breaks, all the flat earthers fall out.
If he gets lucky, we'll be able to make the world great again.
Not to worry.... it's all plastic these days.
If you can hit Canada and Mexico whilst leaving the US intact it triggers a bonus round.
They say it's filled with boiling rock.
It’s okay, all the good people were already Raptured.
I hope it's not going to spray hot magma everywhere like the last one.
When are we going to tell him it's just magma inside?
I hate when these things just have humans inside.
Couldn’t make it any worse.
It ends not with a bang but a bash.
He better hurry before they blow themselves up.
Hey, easy on the world beater jokes.
Wait until he finds out there’s nothing inside.
Somehow I thought it would be more serious up here.
He's going to be disappointed when all he gets is a bunch of molten lava
Huury! God's coming!
You have to strike a delicate balance between getting the orbit adjusted slightly and causing mass extinction.
Each year he gets closer.
It's funny really, he plays golf right handed.
It's not cool to say, 'use the Force'.
Next, we'll pin the tail on a comet.
So that's what makes it go around.
Tell me again why this upsets you.
This could take forever.
To them I’m told it looks like an asteroid
So this is how we get rid of those pesky dinosaurs?
And to think that the earthlings are worried about climate change.
And this is how we cause earthquakes.
It's harder than it looks. But after the last really good hit, all the dinosaurs flew off.
My favorite angel day piñata: this one has Milky Ways in it!
God knows what's in this one !
Nah, it won't break -- but it's amazing how fast it gets them re-focused.
This will be way bigger than the Big Bang.
He's never done this before, so he'll just have to wing it.
The trick is to aim straight at the San Andreas Fault.
Clarence, remember how you earned your wings?  This is how you lose them.
What's the point? It's probably all melted inside anyway.
Can't wait to see the fall-out!
That's not what I meant when I told him to rock my world
The goal is simple, the first one to knock the hell out of it is the winner.
I hear there's oil inside.
I still feel bad about the dinosaurs.
It's full of nuts.
He's no Obi-wan Kenobi.
And God said, "wait, Christians are supporting Trump?" and asked for new alternatives to another flood.
And they thought that global warming was a problem.
Jesus, you'd think after 6,000 years he'd let someone else have a swing.
If he hits it, fly away. It is full of shit.
Rapture? Seems it's going to be more like a rupture to me.
Beats global warming
$5 says he hits N. Korea
This is going to make a big bang.
The big guy said it would be an earth shattering event.
Can you believe he played for the Yankees for 5 seasons?
...and the plan is to blame this on Kevin, right?
He's holding it wrong.
The guy upstairs who pulls the string just laughs and laughs.
How can you miss the world?
I’ve got dibs on the USA.
This takes place in SlowMo. On earth they are calling it "climate change."
Molten iron? This should be fun.
After all we went through to get here, it's actually quite therapeutic.
I've been waiting an eternity for my turn.
The scuttlebutt has it that the Cherubim are using corked bats.
Unfortunately, he missed the Donald Trump pinata the first time.
He's given up on free will
Every time a bells rings, an angel takes a swing!
Maybe climate change really won't be a problem after all.
The real reason why earthquakes happen.
whats's the point, last time he hit it the continents just moved around.
This shoulg get their attention.
I don't know, but he says the planet is full of it.
Sure wish God would stop pullin' on it and let the poor guy hit the dumb thing?
If he only knew what he was missing.
No good will come out of this.
Should we tell them the truth about earthquakes?
Looks like the boss has finally 
had it with climate change deniers
Hopefully,​ this won't take too long, last week we did Pluto.​
You can have the righteous people, they stick to my dental work.
It's probably empty again; but it keeps him hoping for the best"
Last time we played this game Trump was elected.
Wait until you see who we are pinning the tail on.
Remember what he did to Pluto.
I wouldn't worry. He played for the Mets!!
He's doing his Donald Trump impression.
It's how he celebrates Earth Day.
Wait until you see what comes out of this one!
If he hits France, it's bonbons. If  he hits the US, it's Skitttles.
It’s hardly Earth shattering news that God loves a piñata party.
Won’t he be surprised — it’s filled with suckers.
He failed to destroy it when he was alive.
What do you think the boss has in mind with these exercises?
What? You thought those disasters were all natural?
Yes, Earth, as we know it, is about to end - but what about those emails!?!
Who cleans up the mess after he hits it?  You miss the point. He is cleaning the mess.
We're not the better angels.
This is how we do quantum indeterminacy.
Tell me again why the blindfold is necessary?
Don't get too excited. Nothing good comes out of it.
This is so much more fun than the dice that the big boss plays!
It’s been five billion years...when will he give up?
At this rate, it will take 7 days to break it.
I feel like this could last an eternity.
I thought he had the whole world in his hands?
Are you sure this is how to start a Big Bang?
I heard his batting average is out of this world.
No, this is it. Budget cutbacks.
Apparently this is how he passed time at the EPA?
You know the saying: Spare the rod, spoil the planet.'
I hope the four horsemen remember to bring the pizza.
The bouncy castle was booked for Eternity.
Trump's right: global warming isn't the real threat to the planet.
Maybe we should lose the blindfold.
Thank God he's not on our softball team.
We call this game 'Trumping'"
This is going to piss off a lot of people!
This is why he’s always picked last for softball.
You can stop. They’ve got a guy down there now who tweets instead and never misses.
The winner gets a face full of magma.  It's so awesome.
To have a real chance of cracking it, you have to hit 
the San Andreas Fault
Another Flat Earth Society member?
I thought we were gonna play 'Spin the Globe'  instead.
Personally, I’ve always preferred Pin the Tail on Satan.
I'll mention your tetherball suggestion.
On earth, it was the umpires who were blind.
Not to worry.....he has trouble with a curve.
Wait for the look on his face when all the garbage spills out.
He's been reading Revelations again
I thought an Earth Day cake would be easier, but I couldn't find a baker.
Make it fast.  He's coming.
It's the only piñata we've got, let's not waste it.
After this, they will be serving cake, angel food, of course.
Five more minutes and I'm going Old Testament on that thing.
We're going to need a bigger bat
All I got for my birthday was this lousy robe.
Its been 4.5 billion years, you'd think he'd give someone else a try.
We could be here forever.
The last time somebody actually hit it, there were dinosaurs all over the place.
So, this is how it ends?
The last time, all we got were dinosaurs.
They don’t really need any help.
Okay. We’ll give you Big Bang.
Funny to think they're just one swing away from Armageddon.
We call it "Rapture Ball".
One thing I know--the people of that planet don't need help destroying it.
They don't realize that climate change is not the worst thing that can happen.
I think he gets three strikes, Father, son and, well, you know.
What are we going to do when we run out of planets?
The last time he connected was about 65 million years ago. And we managed to convince the current inhabitants it was an asteroid.
Little does he know, there’s nothing inside but 40 lbs of plastic bags.
The lefties always have a problem with this. They are too caring.
so much for omniscience.
And THAT is what makes the world go 'round!
You were an Existentialist before, right?
He used to work for the EPA.
Nah, this guy's been at it for years. I say global warming gets 'em first.
Shoulda made it flat.
We let them get it out of their system the first few days.
I can't wait to see what's in it.
I  have a bad feeling about this!
The Rapture isn't what they think it is.
It's been long enough, I think it's time we tell him to swing a bit to the left.
I think he'll be disappointed that it's filled with smog and outstanding debt.
Does he realise that it's just filled with people?
He looks more like a Met than an Angel.
Didn’t anyone tell him it’s love that makes the world go round?
Apparently, on the 8th day he filled it with candy.
It worked with the dinosaurs.
Swings like a cherub.
Gabriel is better with the horn.
It works better than meditation.
And they’re so worried about climate change.
Were you praying for him to hit or miss?
Only In New York
Think he'll hit it before it falls apart on it's own?"
Get ready to scramble when all hell breaks loose.
Wait. Why does Comey get another swing?
I think he needs a bigger target.  How about Jupiter?
Ten bucks if he hits Tel Aviv.
He needs to be more patient... that was high and inside.
I hope we didn’t get another empty one.
We used to have water balloon fights, but that caused a flood of complaints.
He's getting warmer.
I'm guessing some earthly delights are inside.
He's been at it for over four-and-a-half billion years--let's just take off the blindfold and get it over with.
Are they still down there singing He's got the whole world in His hands?
It used to be a lot easier to hit the icecaps.
That was some hit on Hawaii!
Is this.....is this cultural appropriation?
Fortunately for the Earth, he's a Baltimore Oriole.
He wants to change the world.
I love these apocalypse parties.
We can't hurt it anymore then they are.
Wait, where did you hang that thing from?
Not to worry. Other than Mike Trout, the Angels can’t hit.
The blindfold became mandatory after we lost the dinosaurs.
It's  absolutely stuffed with garbage and ideologues
Are you sure God said it was OK to do this?
Prayer works, but it's all pretty random, actually.
If he hits it we get stuck with Republicans.
We could be here for eternity."
I just think we're better than this.
Yeesh. One of us really ought to go summon our better angels.
The end is near.
No one here is allergic to nuts, right?
If God finds out, tell him it was Lucifer’s idea.
He’s got the world on a string and he still can’t see it!
Ignore the screams
Ever wondered why bad things happen to good people?
No, Gary. The real Earth is much bigger.
I hope that a hundred little dictators don't come falling out.
Three strikes and Earth is out
Personally, I prefer the nuclear option.
It's a metaphor.
Lord knows you put a righty batter against a left spinning earth.
Tryouts to head the heavenly EPA
Trump makes it look so easy....
The Real 'Angels in the Outfield.'
I would guess it's 70% plastic & 30% styrofoam.
It's Trump's new reality show.
If only they knew what a "hole in the ozone layer" actually meant.
What's inside? Mostly suckers.
He told us to stop. They're doing it themselves down there.
Last time he did this Trump got elected.
This oughta shake things up.
It would be apocalyptic if he were ever to hit it.
I said it might be time to take a swing "by" Earth
It was just a trial balloon anyway
One of these days he's not gonna miss
He always did think he had the world on a string
This is going to drive all the Meteorologists crazy.
...and they worry about meteors!
We used to take better care of it, but if THEY won't why should WE?
The store was out of piñatas so we had to improvise
Watch out a bunch of stupid people are about to fall out.
God told him to beat the hell out of it.
Good news for them is he hits like the Mets’ offense.
I just hope the prize isn't humans again.
He actually only hits it once every billion years or so.
Do you think this is what He meant by The Piñacolypse?
This beats seeing how many can fit on the head of a pin.
You should have used Jupiter.
Knock the hell out of it.  It's full of sinners!
Wings, yes; Jedi powers, no.
Your getting warm.
No real need to expedite the process.  Let them do it themselves.
It beats watching climate change.
His first hit was Hawaii, but it was only a crack.
End of life on Earth, sure, but somebody needs to get that candy.
I bet two-thirds of the candy is salt water taffy.
Some how I didn't picture the apocalypse playing out this way.
It's a dramatization of human influence on earth...
Remember when Gary nailed it with a solid whack and the dinosaurs went extinct?
That’s trumps new Secretary of State !
and they still think it's global warming
There ought to be a better way to earn your wings.
It's his birthday, The old man said give him what he wants.
Our decent and honest pitches do not seem to be able to overcome the bat out of hell
Now you know why his batting average sucked when he played for the real Angels.
Trump would call this diplomacy.
When you break it open nowadays, fracking sand goes all over the place.
My favorite is pin the tail on the comet.
65 million years! He's had his turn!
If you think this is bad, you should see what we're doing with the real Earth.
So that's how they came up with the Big Bang Theory.
What the hell is Donald doing now?
Nothing good will come out of this.
The Master thought that one blind-folded angel couldn't mess up the world more than one egocentric world leader.
World peace - take a whack at it!
He missed again. Trump stays.
Yes, He did say He'd never destroy the earth again -- with a flood.  But the agreement did not cover using it as a pinata!
All I got for my birthday was Saturn Ring Toss.
So, an 'act of GOD' is not really an ACT-OF-GOD?
They're expecting it.
And yet another Secretary of State."
This game is called "Divine Intervention"
Gabriel's batting average tanked after the Big Man got soft post-Old Testament and made him start wearing that blindfold.
It’s only a good metaphor if he lands one.
So if he connects, we’re only supposed to gather up the raptured ones, right? And we let the others fall below?
We figured the world was going to end anyway.
Of course it's funny, but what if he actually hits it?
Fire and ice, earthquakes and floods—Piñata Stick of the Angels was totally off their radar.
Let's hope something good comes out of it.
The core is so hot that the candy will be gooey, I just know it.
A bad party's not the end of the world.
After the Republicans took over, they privatized the place.
St. Peter really went with a dark theme for his party.
The mortals are trashing it anyway, so why not?
They're used to it - call it "God's Will."
Tsunami or earthquake?
Copernicus wasn’t even close.
WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHAT TOOK THE RAPTURE SO LONG, IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE TERRIBLE AIM.
Ever since November 8, 2016 he’s been getting closer and closer.
We're just hastening the inevitable.
Bet Trump destroys it before Gabe!
And they think that anything they do matters.
It was this or Whack-A-Mole.
No one has the heart to tell him what’s really inside.
When he taps it, and a little lava comes out like that, it makes me wonder if we should really be playing this.
He'll never get it. We're waiting for the Big Guy.
Extra bonus points for hitting the San Andreas fault
When I heard "God doesn't play dice," this isn't exactly what I imagined.
He hits it, all “Hell” breaks loose.
Of course there's no candy inside. But they're so much nicer to each other for a few weeks after one of us gets a hit.
Now there's only one moon.
They were out of regular piñatas.
He was getting bored and this definitely beats the dreidel.
Planet Pinata is actually the real cause of climate change. We need to leak this somehow to the White House.
They say his son is now president.
The candy's probably all melted anyhow.
He'd better hurry before it self-destructs.
They had plenty of opportunity to get it right.
This kind of behavior would not be acceptable in the Old Testament.
Trust me, you don't want what's inside it.
Pyroclastic flow at Fuego? That's nothing. My welcome party caused Pangea to divide.
No candy, just magma.
I believe I am ready now to ascend past whack-a- planet
Try to put your wings into it this time"
Candies?  Molten lava?  Honestly, I don't know.
He better hurry up or it's going to explode on its own.
And that's how he broke the crust of this chocolate ball into five continents"
I don’t care if we are angels.  This company picnic stinks.
There's nothing inside. God was just done with it.
Don't get too excited. Even if he breaks it, the candy inside is over four billion years old.
Won't they think God's angry about the gays again?
I hear the Boss has $20 on the humans destroying it first.
Hey, it's a Mexican tradition. He's only allowed to hit it south of The Wall.
Sometimes I can't look, either.
He's a cinch to get sent down.
Don't expect candy anytime soon. He hasn't come close in 4 billion years.
So .... God does have a sense of humor.
All we know for sure is it’s not candy!!
I hope it's filled with gummy worms.
Don't worry. They'll blame North Korea.
Looks like Uriel plays for the Mets, not the Angels.
If it doesn't stop spinning, he'll never hit it.
And that's how we make hurricanes.
We'll always have Mars.
Gabriel is taking this flat earth debate a bit too far.
Hey, If you have a better activity until they fix the cable i'm all ears.
According to Revelations, he should have hit it by now.
I think of it more as a coup de grace.
If he connects, I’m not cleaning up the mess.
We were going to do paintball, but the old man put six days into it.
We should stand back. It’s full of shit.
The suspense is killing them.
He told us floods hadn't "proved effective."
Aren’t there bedbugs on that thing?
And on the eighth day He partied.
I mean, he's hit America like-non-stop since '17. Nobody's THAT good...
What in the world...will come out of there?
Come on... no one has hit that thing in 65 million years!
Well, so much for the better angels of our nature.
Remember what happened to the dinosaurs the last time he actually made contact?
It's filled with egocentric people.
He claims it was a popular party game at the E.P.A.
You say he was once a climate change denier?
So much for World Peace...
They'll never suspect it's us
No earthly good can come of this exercise.
If filled it with thoughts and prayers.
A world with end.  Amen.
Yes, god is vengeful, but this guy is the worst.
You'd think after 4.5 billion years he would have hit it by now
It’s a tradition that started with The Big Bang.
You'd think that he could bat a thousand up here.
This is God's last swing at world peace.
Those damn melting ice caps are making it too slippery
Silly me, I thought earthquakes were acts of Nature.
He struck out a lot during Existentialism"
A pinata?!  I thought He was going to use fire the next time they screwed up.
We always start them off in tee ball.
Rumors say this year it's full of nuts.
With a little divine intervention, he might hit Washington, D.C.
Should we tell him it's not full of candy?
I’ve heard of Atlas Shrugged, but this is ridiculous.
Happy Earth Day
So, this is how the world ends?
And they worry about climate change.  If they only knew.
Looks like I'm not the only one frustrated with how things are going.
He says it's cathartic.
Against our better angels.
The Daily News Cycle
It's broken already.  He just can't see it.
The games were more fun when Obama was president.
Sorry to say, it's not love that makes the world go round.
I understand he was with the Trump Administration.
I Dunno. I always imagined logic playing a larger part.
Ten points if you hit the San Andreas.
He’s still very bitter about the whole Trump thing.
We thought this seemed like a lot more fun than just waiting around for nuclear annihilation
Doesn't he know what's in the middle of that thing?
If the Earth isn't flat now, it sure will be when she's through with it!
That explains the reports we’ve been getting of heavy wind gusts in Chicago
The last time we played this game was 65 million years ago.
If he hits a magnitude 10, i'm getting a transfer...
So that's what causes earthquakes
If he hits this one out of the park we could have some overcrowding issues."
That's why he was never drafted
It's been over four billion years - when's it our turn?
El Niño is terrible at this.
If he misses it, you know who gets elected in again in 2020.
At this rate, we'll be waiting an eternity.
Everything he learned about batting he got from the Mets.
We call this game "The Apocalypse."
God wanted something quicker and more festive than global warming.
I thought God's flood trick was more effective....
Be careful what you swish for.
Nothing sweet is coming out of that.
For some, breaking it is therapeutic.
Where's Jesus? It's HIS birthday.
Don’t worry, he’s had a few too many Bloody Hail Marys to actually hit it.
I miss Earth a lot, too
It gives new meaning to fate, doesn't it?
We don't let Lucifer play. He peeks.
Hark! The herald angels swing...fa la la la...la la la la...
There goes Geology 101.
If you don't get it on the first few tries, the humans end up destroying it themselves.
He always thinks the world revolves around him.
The country he hits will determine who Trump tweets about tomorrow.
The last time we played this game, Michael wiped out the dinosaurs.
I hate these Armageddon parties.
Be careful, this guy always throws the bat.
Owns the cattle on a thousand hills but apparently only one party game.
Relax. It’s just a problem-solving exercise.
It has something to do with the next presidential election...
Mercury must be in retrograde.
I hope he smacks the Hell out of that thing.
What with the temperature and all, the candy will be all melted.
Does he have any idea that thing is full of crude oil and methane?
Just a few more whacks should get it back in orbit" he said
I don't know why he's trying so hard, I hear it's mostly water.
When we told him that Trump's in charge, he started to swing harder and more often.
So far, he's 0 for 10,000,000,001
Remember a couple of years ago when you gave them Trump?
For God so loved the world... but Fred sure doesn't.
Hope it’s less messy than Uranus!
Dont worry, they’ll blame it on global warming
I prefer dice.
Is this what they call fracking?
He's from the EPA. Give him time.
That's how bad things happen to good people.
He said he wants to make Earth great again.
I've heard some pretty crazy interpretations of Revelations over the millennia, but this one takes the cake.
We told him it was Pluto.
His birthday doesn't even line up with the apocalypse
Better to make a game out of it than watch it destroy itself on it's own.
sardonic angel mocking Trump’s foreign policy!
You want climate change?  I’ll show you climate change!
What should it be this time?  Tidal wave?
........and this is your Old Testament section .
I tried to use a rock, but all it did was wipe out the dinosaurs.
Mercury was too small, and Venus too hot.  And Saturn was just all kinds of wrong.
Waste of energy: it'll blow up by itself  soon.
I hear Trump is doing the same thing on Earth.
We used to play ring toss with Saturn.
Remember when you said cultural appropriation wasn’t the end of the world?
I haven't the heart to tell him it's just empty inside.
Testing Testing 1, 2, 3.
Every time Trump rings that Diet Coke bell, an angel gets a swing.
How's this Big Bang for ya!?
No ones managed to hit it in 4 billion years...
It's fun when the magma spills out.
Vlad you're next after Donald gets one more swing
You mean He just made that part up about the battle between the good and bad angels?
And they were worried about climate change.
Boy is he in for a surprise. If he smashes the globe, he gets to be the Angel of Death.
Back on earth, they blame global warming.
So, all that stuff in the Book of Revelations was really just a cover story for this little shindig?
Mass Extinction Events and St Matthews birthday: A Correlation.
Technically, the odds for any swing connecting are the same. But he's missed now for 4 billion years.
He gets another pair of wings if he can smack Washington, D.C., off the globe.
Michael's left handed?
The Donald's"  guardian angel- why
Someone hits it every four years at election time.
we're all gonna miss the Earth soon...
He can totally see through that blindfold.
OMG! It was a ‘Big Bang’
Just candy. He's a loving God, remember?
Shoo, ozone layer...shoo!
They think it's global warming.
I don't know which is sadder, him flailing at it for the past seven hundred years, or me watching the whole time.
He still thinks the world is flat.
I'm surprised he's having such a hell of a time.
Aethelwold is the  Patron Saint of the unfeasibly uncoordinated.
Fire and brimstone was no fun.
So much for divine intervention.
I wonder what the flat earth crowd will think of this?
Every rime a bell rings, an angel gets his swings.
You know this is how the dinosaurs went extinct.
Cultural appropriation.
I think he’s more suited for the Mets
The doomsday’ clock is at 11:55; you’ve got five minutes to finish it off
We replaced the flap of a butterfly's wing to send a message.
St. Louis is in a slump.
The beatings will continue until morality improves.
This is how mountains and valleys are made.
It's only a game if you believe its a game
Don’t get your hopes up.  It’s filled with coal and oil.”
Centuries ago we did it the old way. No blindfolds. A good aim really got you hell on earth.
I wonder how many hits this thing can take before it's all over.
We can't even ACCIDENTALLY destroy Earth...
I wanted to get one of those Trump heads, but hellzapoppin right now, and they were all sold out.
My bet was on Global Warming to destroy Earth.
On earth, this is call tectonic shift.
Trump Towers are worth a free turn.
Does it matter? The world has already gone to pieces.
No one can hit the screwball.
You're thaying what they taught us in the fifth grade about the origin of tornados was a myth. What will a hit be?
This game only really took off around November 2016
I'm saving myself for 'Pin The Tail on The Donald'.
Used to filled with truffles, now it's all spam.
He didn't care for life on Earth
It’s pretty hard to hit only Trump with the blindfold on, but I think he’s peeking!
Lucifer, you gave Samael another shot of tequila, didn’t you?
I’d feel better about this if one of us was Mexican.
Doubt there's anything good in this one.
I hope it’s not all dinosaurs like last time.
I thought a trumpet blast would start this off.
You don't want to know what it's full of.
Just one more good whack should do it.
You're only saying that because someone else is enjoying it.
Are you sure this is the best way to deactivate Donald Trump's Twitter account?"
He’s just messing with them. They don’t believe in climate change and science.
It will be tough to top those Mars candies.
Oh. Dios. Mío.
Who the hell gave Trump wings?
NOW can you see the problem with cultural appropriation?
C’mon, there are plenty of planets if we lose this one...
We have prayed and prayed, now we are just going to wing it.
Oh right, it's hurricane season again...
Who's minding the gates?
"In the last couple of years, he's getting closer and closer.
He was the only Leftist that's made it here so far."
What’s “The Force”?
What a bummer. Even up here it's a piñata instead of paintball.
Watch it. The last time he lost we got Trump.
Every time an extraction industry CEO tithes a million bucks to the church, we take another swing.
Well I guess you could say it isn’t ENTIRELY random.
End of world" delayed on more time
We had a really fantastic meeting. A lot of progress. Really very positive. I think better than anyone could have expected. Top of the line. Really good.
Humans still think it's global warming!
Can it get any worse?
Ten points for Gryffindor if you hit Antarctica
What were you expecting, charades?
The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Soon, I hope.
He was a polluter.  He'll be swinging away for eternity.
...But I guess the other guy has a much bigger stick, and his works!
He knows it's filled with magma, right?
I’m betting Germany. Again.
It's supposed to be random, but since November 2016 we keep whacking it in Washington DC.
He's going to be REALLY disappointed when he finds out what's inside that thing
Gee, I wish he would hurry up.  It seems like we've been waiting forever..
I wish he would swing a little lower: Tump is in South America this week.
Last time we hit it, water went everywhere.
And they think climate change is the problem.
He set a record for strike-outs in 2017 too.
You can read how to make one in the genesis book.
But I heard earth was flat.
Isn't it ironic, on Earth he was a member of the Flat Earth Society.
What’s it filled with?” 
“Hate.
Yeah, but for my birthday He got me a gift card.
I guess God doesn’t play dice.
Until recent events, I never heard God say that she had a birthday.
If it was only a game.
If you think this looks fun, wait until we pin the tail on the comet.
Yeah, but this is FAKE heaven. Apparently he negotiated a deal with the devil to "take a whack at the universe."  You voted for him, too?
We do this every fall. They think it’s just hurricane season.
Of course it is a Piñata!
He's going to be real disappointed when all he finds is garbage.
It really needs a good whack!
So, ah, you still think this will send the message or should we try something a bit more direct...
This game's not much fun, but next we'll play "Pin the tail on Uranus."
I thought it would be nukes.
Wanna go to the party in Hell? I hear they have a dunk tank.
I thought the Apocalypse would be much more...definitive.
When he hits, yell 'big bang'!
I missed choir for this?
So this is the source of the Jet Stream.
It's God's way of dealing with the age of Trump!
I wonder what will happen when all the lava inside pours out.
And on the 2,198,000th day, God decided to smack them around a bit.
This is why we make him play in the outfield.
As below, so above.
Now don't hog all the thoughts & prayers this time.
My money's on Scott Pruitt over Gabriel.
Sure, on "Earth" he was a Yankee.
We call it "Trump ball."
I warned him this one was already broken.
Can’t get any worse, right?
You kidding, caramels?  Nuts, all nuts.
His name? Coal.
Don't blame me. I voted for pin-the-tailwind on the televangelist's private jet
Just wait until Trump gets up.
It's a pretty tough nut to crack, but I heard there are internal problems weakening its structural and spiritual integrity.
Next we pin the rings on Saturn.
It’s Scott Pruitt’s day off.
...We’ll see what happens.
And so that’s how we get leap years.
Was it Sinatra who sang, "I've got the world on a string?"
A flat piñata would’ve been ridiculous.
The President's second to last tweet.
I remember it as being a bit larger.
This is a revelation.
We really should have made it flat.
This is the real cause of climate change.
The mortals call it "Climate Change," but we're just goofing off.
He never could hit a hanging curve ...
Paradoxically, this his how Donald Trump's Guardian Angel likes to celebrate Cinco de Mayo
Ready or not---here comes Armageddon"
They’re gonna have to rewrite Revelations after my turn!
2018 World Series
I was always told thunder was God bowling. Who knew?
Didn't we just do this 65,000,000 years ago?
I’m guessing there’s no Smarties in there.
Does the clown know how to get here?
He would've gone pro if it wasn't for the dino fiasco 243 million years ago.
Trump wouldn’t miss.
I asked but the guy said they discontinued Pluto
We have to change the rules...strike "infinity" slows the game down.
Are we 100% sure this isn't hell?
That's why we call him "hurricane."
Missed again!! Doesn’t matter... they will destroy it themselves.
Why are we all white?
Seem like just more Pin Yadda Yadda Yadda.
I've never been to one of these. But, they say the treats are heavenly.
Watch, we're going to lower it so he hits Saint Ralph in the crotch. It will be great on YouTube.
St. Peter decided to change the stakes.  Three strikes, a trap door opens, and, well, you know.
time for a little tough love"
It's filled with the milky way.
Scott Pruitt gets the last swing.
Just be thankful you're not in hell, where you would be the piñata.
Heh, Heh - They think it's global warming
Lucifer, show God that you can rule Earth.
And, they still wonder what happened to the dinosaurs.
He's definitely not  Dominican!
If anyone asks,  just blame it on San Francisco
For God's sake, just adopt the designated hitter already.
His brother plays hockey for the Devils.
If  he misses West Virginia do we still get the candy?
They call them 'earth quakes'
There’s our ringer. He was whack a mole champion three years straight.
It doesn't look that tough, but trust me, something that flat and spinning is hard to hit.
We wanted a clown, but they were both in Singapore for a big meeting.
All I’m saying is I don’t want to have to pick up the pieces this time.
What happened to our standards? Scott Pruitt in Heaven?
This always ends badly
He's been at it for a millenniums, I'm starting to suspect divine intervention.
Well that shoots Newton’s theory.
Last time he hit it out of orbit.
It's the President's solution to global warming.
I always thought there was something strange about Lucifer.
This explains Trumps foreign policy!
You swing like a girl!
Thankfully, it has a flaky crust.
Well, it can’t get any worse.
It was Donald's idea.
I always said he had a limited world view!"
I just hope that it isn't full of  deplorables.
When He's really upset, bowling.
This is so boring... All he's done is put a few holes in the ozone.
Not to worry. In life he played for the Mets.
The last time he connected was Nov 2016
You gotta admit it's a bit more direct than climate change.
Earth is safe.  He whiffed on Jupiter.
Should we tell him to give up? It's made of plastic and nearly impossible to break apart.
Yeah, every Cinco de Mayo.
He saw 'Angels in the Outfield' one time too many!
I know his lifelong dream was to bat for the Angels but this still seems wrong somehow.
I never thought that evil could be explained so easily.
Unfortunately it’s becoming a more frequent anger management exercise.
OSHA won't let us use fire and brimstone.
It's mostly filled with useless plastic junk.
He couldn't hit the broad side of the solar system!
Mooned it.
I thought we could try a fun way to beat the Hell out of it.
You know if he hits it all hell breaks loose. Last time it was hit was way back in 2016.
Wait, what? Airheads is a candy?
When it's my turn I'm gonna whack a guy in the nuts. It's gonna be hilarious watch.
This would be so much easier if it was flat.
I can remember when we just threw darts at a map of Russia.
Flatten it already!
Better check the supply of wings.
In his hey day he was a world beater.
When you are a fallen angel, I guess you have a lot of pent up aggression
You'd have to be a fool not to see this coming after Trump was elected.
He's quite the ArcAngel
I have mixed feelings. It’s a fun game, but it always takes him so long to make us a new one.
Dude! You've been spinning that thing for like 4.543 billion years. Hurry it up!"
No need for angels in the outfield.
The way things are going down there, I doubt they'll even notice when he finally whacks it.
Yeah, the big guy calls it a "siñata," thinks it's HILARIOUS.
Found it in a box of junk out by the Big Guy's curb and thought we'd give it one last go.
"it's just a game they play. He used to be a TV weather man down below.
He’s missing on purpose...he knows about the magma.
Even with the blindfold it seems like we keep hitting Mississippi
Eventually
Someone took "Make Earth Day pop!" way too literally.
Why not, everyone else has had a go at it!
The earth is safe. He could never hit the high outside curveball.
My money was on 3000 AD, but I suppose I'm not surprised
I have never seen Armageddon take this long before.
The game of Life. Heaven only knows what the rules are.
The newbies always have trouble adjusting to the infinite dimensions beyond space and time.
He keeps trying for Washington, D.C.
It’s virtual reality for flat-earthers.”
You know, the big man will probably not be happy with this.
I’ll be worth the sugar rush.
Last time he hit it nothing came out, but Trump got elected.
It's a piñata and only works if you knock down the border wall.
You know Lucifer would have cracked it open on his first swing.
They call it the Trump Doctrine.
Blindfolded or not, he'll never hit earth with that awful grip
I miss the days when they were filled with ‘Smarties’
His last solid hit was 66 million years ago.
I am curious to see what’s inside
This will ruin our reputation.
I always stand at least ten feet away. I'm a bit scared of the lava and molten rock that comes out of the bottom. And the racists.
Justice is supposed to be blind, after all!
The better angels are over it.
I pray no one breaks the pinata -- God knows what's in it...
There has to be a more ethical way to determine who moves on to the afterlife
Twenty bucks says tsunami in South America.
Should we tell him there’s no candy inside?
Did we make sure Jesus is out of there yet?
I wish he'd hurry up so we can sing Happy Birthday and cut the moon.
On Earth he was a bible thumper, now it's all fun and games
If he connects, they'll believe it's an earthquake.
He used to have the world world in his hands.
They ruined us, so now we’re returning the favor.
You hear about this new 'plate tectonics' theory the humans came up with?
My money's on a tsunami off the coast of Japan...
El Niño is way too good at this!
Yes, this is our new foreign policy.
This is a test.
Relax, this one has no goodies.
Not good at world peace; let’s put her in charge of the courts.
I wanted to get the Spongebob pinata.
It's filled with 72 virgins.
He's the American.
We are so wrong for this!
Candy? No, we're hoping for fossil fuel.
Don't worry – it's humane. They only feel a small stinging sensation.
Jupiter would have been easier
Hit it hard enough and all their politicians fall out
Here 'the meek shall inherit the Earth' means they all get to take a whack at it.
Imagine if Mother Nature could have a swing at this.
He got a good whack in 66 million years ago.  I've got a feeling he's due for another one soon.
I wouldn't if I were you! It's full of toxic waste.
Lucifer throws some great parties, but for some reason I just don't trust the guy.
Wait. If we're in Heaven, what's that thing tied to?
I wonder who controls the string...
This party sucks.
So, in the full-sized one that's how we're thinking the moon should work.
WOW - this isn't going to turn out good at all!
If you cause a tsunami, you get a bonus swing.
Little do they know this is the real reason behind climate change
He was Secretary of State.
Even in heaven we have republicans.
God, I miss steroids.
I don't have the heart to tell him that it's empty.
God loves party games
It's really just filled with hot air.
This should be good. We've never had a baseball player here before.
Kingdom Come
Stand back when the magma comes out.
“Still...he has a heavenly swing”
One more miss and he goes back to Limbo.
You're sure He's okay with this?
I bet they’ll still blame Trump
So the Rabbi says, ‘Why the long face?’... you get it?  Because he’s a horse.”

“Yeah... I get it.
Last time it was full of dinosaurs
You have to admit...it's a lot quicker than climate change.
It says it right here in Leviticus: no man may come near who is lame or blind or has damaged testicles. So what do you think?
I think we shoud've gone with pin the tail on the donkey
Maybe this will wake them up
I see dead people.
This could take a couple billon years!
If you guys would stop beating on it, I think it might support life.
Did you hear the new Kanye album?
Ha! He swings like a Man!
I heard there's bonus points for the White House.
I don't know why he bothers - he voted for Trump.
They’re all on steroids these days
I wish we could just borrow someone from below to throw a real after-party.
The Pearly Gates guys are always the worst.
Lucifer. Cheers him up.
Shit!
The last time someone hit it there were dinosaurs all over the place.
You know he's peeking. Just what angels gotta do.
„No loss, it was infested by two-legged parasites, anyway.“
So then we WERE living in a world made of papier-mâché?
And they're afraid of asteroids!
Every few million years, same old thing.
I guess this explains Trump.
It’s his 3rd strike. If he misses you know where he goes.
When he whiffs it, it causes a typhoon.
He hasn't made contact since there were dinosaurs.
It's okay, he always misses the first two swings.
I don't know about you, but I doubt there is candy inside.
I'm so over earthly delights. Aren't you?
The Big Bang Theory Sequel
Scientists could not figure out what was causing the disappearance of the Earth’s blue whales, frogs, coke bottles, and Sweden’s berries.
The count is three and two. Should Earth be concerned?
'And THAT'S why he was traded to the Minors before he keeled over.'
I guess He's had it with them.
...and that’s how Donald Trump became President...
its a hot mess at this point
I heard it's all plastic wrappers, no candy.
Mother Nature sure knows how to throw a party.
HE BELONGS TO TRUMP'S TEAM,  TASATANWHE', "TAKEASWINGATANYWHERE".
We used to use Pluto but it was too small.
Hard to believe he batted .338 for the Reds.
Just because we have Free Will and stick doesn't make it okay
No worries; it takes him thousands of years to hit it.
Do we really want earthlings here?
He has been binge watching CNN!
It's hit or miss with this world
The boss is looking for more of a multicultural approach to the Last Days.
I'm guessing it's no longer a whimper
She often gets on, but refuses to steal.
I 'm tired of your constant harping at me that I shouldn't be aiming for the fences and just make contact.
Give 'em an earthquake!
Ut dictum est, "Close, but no cigar."
God said he can take the blindfold off on Jan 20th, 2017 if he hasn't hit it by then.
I never noticed that Michael was a lefty.
No-one ever hits it, but the process releases old frustrations and bad memories
Where's the real Batman when we need him?
Uncover your eyes please. You always hit the poor countries.
It's nice to see Donald feels at home.
I mean, I guess it's more fun than the flood was...
Oh relax, that world has already been ruined.
Guess that whole 'Nuclear Threat' thing was just another diversion.
Lucifer and his game of New World Order.  He won't let anyone else have a turn.
I'm not so sure there's anything good inside.
God is on sabbatical
It’s filled with styrofoam and plastic straws.
No, the Olympians play a completely different game, but the results are identical.
Will we have to pick up the pieces?
Gabe put the "arc" in archangel.
We've been here forever. He doesn't have the arm strength for this - all he's making it do is spin.
Should we tell him that inside it’s just a bunch of rocks?
They don't need any help to destroy the wold.   There doing a good job of it all by themslves.
We're just speeding things up a little.
It's gonna be windy, but no earthquake today
Don't waste your energy. They will destroy themselves by ignoring climate change, or maybe something may Trump that.
Smart cookie that Einstein.
We're seeing if we can destroy it before they do.
It's just Trump swinging blindly, even up here.
What's next, pin the tail on Uranus?
Trump and Kim think they're the ones who make the world go round.
No matter how hard he hits it, nothing good comes out
If his aim gets better, Trump wants to hire him.
At least we didn't give him matches this time.
Turns out you can beat it with a stick.
Why are we wasting out energy, when Trump can do it for us?
So it's true, global warming isn't man made
We could not find a Trump piñata.
If it breaks into 7 billion pieces, I'm not cleaning it up.
Don't worry, the mortals are too busy fighting with each other to notice.
Sending a meteor would have been cleaner.
They have no idea how trivial they are.
He hasn't yet grasped the whole non-corporeal thing.
We all did much better at this during the steroid era
I hope we don't get any of those shit hole countries
Is Pruitt on deck?”
“He’s on the other team
Why not? How could it get any worse?
Rapture, Rupture, same difference
So the crazy people are right when they say that climate change is a hoax.
They will think it’s due to global warming.
It seems to have become celestially repellent.
He was called up from the Mexican League.
I know God has a sick sense of humor,but this is a new low.
He can swing away every time Trump tells a lie.
A Trump Hotel in North Korea really was the last straw.
We really need to cut back on the Red Bull.
Global warming is gonna get 'em before Doug does.
He's missed...what...about four and a half billion times now?
St. Francis did not sanction this spectacle, but we have an idea who did.
He hasn't hit it since the Mesozoic era.
Funny, most thought it would be heralded by trumpets!
He's an optimist!  He thinks it's filled with sweets.
Can't wait for the delicious treats that come out of this: pollution, famine, anxiety, unvaccinated children....yum!
Blame Canada.
He'd be better to bunt.
The last time he hit it started the whole global arming thing.
I really don't much care for the taste of lava, do you?
What about free will?
I'd toss whatever comes out,it's toxic.
You know, there's an Angel who can pitch, too.
Shouldn't we warn somebody, in case he hits it?
God's away on business.
Avenging Angel, my ass!
We've been whacking at it for centuries now: it's getting pretty bruised
So this is what it's like to party like it's 1999....
The darned thing is full of nuts, and whoever cracks it open is going to get all of 'em.
Haven't they had enough?
You didn’t know - we’ve been doing this for centuries
I heard there are fruit-loops within.
He's been listening to Carmina Burana again.  O Fortuna really got to him.
We're so close to cracking it
The big guy said it's okay, since we can't do any more damage than they have already.
It’s no worse for their environment than fracking
We’ll call it, Big Bang, Try Not To Screw This One Up, Two.
I hope Atlas doesn’t find out about this.”
As I recall, he was just as bad in the 2009 World Series.
If only justice was as blind as angels playing piñata
We planned to end it with the usual plagues, warfare, fire, et cetera. But then we had the bright idea to throw a fiesta instead!
Ironically, he died on Earth in a piñata related accident.
We've been taking hits for years. They're bound to crack soon.
There better be weed in there this time.
Could only be an improvement at this point.
This ought to settle the Hollow Earth Theory once and for all.
Do you think now is a good time to put it in the strike zone?
With Trump in the White House and Pruit at EPA, this game just isn't as thrilling as it used to be.
We've tried everything else. Maybe this will finally knock some sense into everyone.
If he lands a hit, Saint Peter is going to be working overtime.
Hope for the best. When I hit it a terrible thing happened to one country’s election.
Did anyone tell him about the magma?
The Devil is making him do it....!
How did we end up here? Oh He got in a war with the Canadians' .
Wait 'till she finds they're no goodies inside ...
The round ones are always full of magma.
I suspect it will self-destruct first.
Down there?  No blindfold.
On mice days like this it causes an earthquake. When we play in the rain one hell of a hurricane.
I think he's peeking and trying to hit Canada.
WING batter, batter.
The boss said we're done with this one.
It's O.K. They're going to die anyway.
That piñata is just a hopeless Pandora’s box
His anger management sessions don't seem to be helping very much.
Don't feel too bad - this is the least of their problems.
T-ball isn't  what it used to be.
Turnout has been poor ever since God started stuffing it with fruit snacks.
I know we were told to get rid of the dinosaurs but this seems a bit childish
I tried to stop him, but he really wants the candy...
I told you we should have used a carrot.
She's definitely getting warmer.
I haven't tread there since November 2016.
No worries. It's a Nerf ball.
Yeah, I know this Pinata thing is not the End  as described in Revelations. I think the Big Guy wants to shake up those smug Fundamentalists.
After Trump we pretty much gave up.
Lucifer is really determined to bring this one down.
If he hits it hard enough, can we have nice things again?
Why couldn't we get a bigger target to swing at, like Jupiter?
That's why he's here. Wouldn't hurt a flea.
The climatologists here have an axe to grind.
The center is molten chocolate.
If he breaks it in three swings or less, he has seven days to build something new.  We do this when the worlds go awry.  Want to try?
Has it been 4 billion years yet?
Come on now. You must be blind not to see what you're doing to the earth."
Won’t  that hurt it? No more than the humans have.
This whole Earth project’s been a swing and a miss, huh?
Our GM read The Blind Side, not Moneyball.
Take off the blindfold and I still bet he can't even hit Jupiter.
Well, when people don’t repent we destroy their world by using it as a pinata
Maybe we should remove the mask.
[God pulls up string] "You gotta be quicker than that..."
I can't wait for the mercury, plastics, and pcbs to cometh forth.
At this rate the Rapture will never come.
We haze in heaven?
I hear the parties downstairs are a lot more fun.
He's swinging too hard - he's going to hurt the dinosaurs.
I don't think we'll like what we find inside.
That devil is gonna crush it.
Three strikes and they're out.
Yes, it's empty, but that's the point.
we're suppose to practice for some kind of  apocalypse.
I don't think we can call ourselves angels in the outfield anymore.
Remeber last time Pangea broke
It’s the Anthropocene. New rules went into effect.
Little do they know what is really causing all those earthquakes, they think it is the fracking.
Thinks it is better now before Trump destroys it.
Are you sure this planet is void and empty?
This is way more fun than the flood option.
Not to worry, he has trouble with the curve.
Don't you think he should stop hitting America? They've suffered enough already.
Dibs on the Swedish fish.
I heard that there are some living things on it.
I think he needs to be sent down for more training
THE WAY THE WORLD IS GOING IT IS ALL HIT AND MISS ANYWAY !
We are definitely _not_ the better angels.
I know, Armageddon. Ironic.
If he makes contact we're talking Revelations...
He’s a switch hitter.  Does cyclones and hurricanes.
A swing and a miss! A good day for Earth! Not so much for Michael's chances of getting on the team.
O guess it can't be any worse than what they do themselves down there.
This hits for Trump
He's getting closer.  Are you sure the Old Man will pull it out of the way?
Hit Mexico for another life.
No! There are no candies, why do you ask?
I mean, how blessed can he be?
I heard it's full of nuts.
Never hit above 150 for the Mets either.
I miss the world...but not by that much.
Who's gonna clean it up?
I thought we were guardian angels, not miracle workers.
I hope he gets it on the next swing....that'll make it 2012 swings.
What do you mean, 'did I remember to write this in the Book of Revelations?' You were supposed to write this in the book of Revalations!
Ten Bucks says it's full of nuts
We take the blindfold off every time Trump speaks.
Remember your first marriage, Jimmy!
You know, I'm still trying to decide if I want him to nail the thing or not.
HE always does this on Bing Crosby's birthday and, yes, HE's sittin' on a rainbow. What a world.
They feel the earth move under their feet.
It's a game called Mexico's Revenge.
Well, if Michael ever does hit Earth, I expect it'll get a lot more crowded down below than here!
It's Trump's primary pinata!
Friday's are for divine interventions.
Acts of God aren't covered, but what about acts of angels?"
So far all he’s done is knock down a few satellites.
At this rate it'll take an eternity.
It's a great catharsis, you should try it""
I told Him six days always means a shoddy rush job we have to scrap.
If only getting the good stuff out of the world was that simple...
So this is the Big Bang?
I heard it's filled with eternal hellfire.
Why the Earth spins.
Throws like an angel, swings like a Met.
He's in for a surprise. Instead of candy, the middle is filled with chocolate molten lava cakes.
After this we are playing Pin the Tail on the Comet.
Guess He got tired of playing dice.
Apparently they call these 'shooting stars.'
Here we speak softly and carry a big stick.  Down below it’s speak incoherently and carry big tariffs.
There's really not much to do around here.
That's two strikes.
It should come as no surprise that that thing is chock full of sinners.
He lets us do this whenever He's in one of His 'What have they done for Me lately?' moods.
So, wanna bet that he can do this too on blind faith?
Hark! We never saw the point of it.
It's all fun and games until a tectonic plate is hit.
I know. And they always blame Mother Nature.
We filled it with little sins.
Normally we just play musical chairs, but this seemed more fitting.
Extra points for hitting Washington, DC.
'We sent that Trump guy down to earth to practice.'
Gabriel's aim is awful. We could be here forever.
i don't know man who gives a fuck
One more hit to Hawaii and we'll get to see the gooey center
I wonder if they know this is how earthquakes happen?
Luckily Mr. Trump is ineligible as he has been banished to hell.
I think he forgotten that it's tilted 23.4 degrees on its axis...
Although he thinks he’s Babe Ruth, I’m glad to report he’s really Donald Trump.
If he misses one more time, we’ll use Jupiter.
It’s all landfill.
So it was The Boss’ idea, not the Russians’ to get him elected?!
Next time, let’s get the Pluto one.
Ugh, I bet you it's filled with doves again this year.
I think we have a better chance with the Big Bang approach
They’ll think it’s an asteroid.
So this, this is the meaning of life.  Well, that's just great!
U.S.foreign policy
To think Shakespeare got so close
One that breaks open it’ll be a whole new world.
I heard Hell got a magician.
She trusts her instincts.
The way he keeps missing you'd think it really was flat.
All  Hell may break loose, but it'll be worth it...I'm  for the chewy magma center.
Frank Sinatra, right?
He better not get this *and* the new harp.
Joke's on him, this one's filled with dirt.
That's God's Piñata pitch, nobody can hit it.
Last time we played, all the dinosaurs fell out.
I thought Armageddon would play out differently.
Stop hitting the poor countries!
Don’t worry, he’s only going to hit Canada.
We really should come up with a new game.  Every time we play this one we get blamed for earthquakes and tidal waves.
Like humans treat it any better"
Don’t get too close. It’s filled with molten rock.
Even here...still cannot hit the broad side of a barn
And that's how earthquakes are created.
What's the point?
Any minute now it's going to fall apart anyway.
Do we have a moral obligation to let the inhabitants know about our piñata finals?
Do the care labels for our robes mention 10,000 degree molten iron?"
I couldn't find a flat one.
Who asked for a do-over?
I didn't know in heaven I'd have a birthday party.
You know who’s awesome at this? Donald Trump.
Be patient. He was good at smashing pumpkins.
Is this really the best way to cause the next mass extinction?
If he hits it, don’t you worry about another Mueller investigation?
He’d better hit if before it explodes on its own.
I would call it 'The shot heard around the World,' but I think it has already been used
He was once an Angels' hitter
"Once he works out the mechanics of his swing, climate change will look like nothing."
So, Gabriel couldn't find his horn?
I'd say people are destroying it without our help.
Not to worry!  He pitched in the American League.
He was never very good at Earthly endeavors!
Well, if it is some kind of test...
I think we're about to fail with flying colors.
Imagine if humanity knew what really killed the dinosaurs.
It has to be at least a Richter 9.2 to fracture the Earth's crust.
Don't look so surprised Macron, Merkel tried to tell you.
It's empty.
He's got the whole world in his hands.
Really, the killer asteroid we used last time showed some class.
Aw, why does he get to start the rapture?
'You know, down there they call him the moon'
Must be a bithday.  The line is unbelievable on Cinco de Mayo.
Pray he doesn't hit North Korea.
Oh relax and enjoy the party. How can this be worse than what they’re doing to it?
Three strikes send you back.
Why bother? They've already mined all the candy out of it.
are you sure this is the right piñata?
The boss is unhappy with Trump.
Doesn't he know it's going to destroy itself in a couple millennia anyways?
Do we even know what's in there?
This just wouldn't work as well if it was flat.
It's not as fun without Lucifer here
I told you we should have voted.
The big stick I understand, but what happened to speaking softly?
Well, it's really more like  "wack-a-mole"
The Boss decided that 'ending with a whimper' wasn't an option.
That was a hurricane. Only the hits register on the Richter scale.
This is Global Whiffing.
I thought Trump and Scott Pruitt were taking care of this.
The Mass Extinction party theme is so played out.
Because if you get the moon on the first swing you’re allowed to go again
He used to be a member of Congress.
We 're playing the Canadian version. The candy doesn't come out unless you hit D.C.
There isn't enough candy in the world to make this worth it!
They think they're tracking an asteroid.
Ya le diste una!

ya le diste dos!

ya le diste tres!…y tu tiempo se acabo!!”
Really in the mood for some fine chocolates-- I'm aiming for Belgium
Aim for the ozone--they'll never notice!
He's not nearly as effective as Trump's turn at the G7 summit.
Get ready for the apocalypse - Hank Aaron's batting clean up.
I like to watch the ants fall off
He'll never hit it if it keeps rotating like that.
He knows there isn't candy in there, right?
Now I know why they put the angels in the outfield.
Give him time, he just got called up
It will be a miracle if he hits it.
It’s full of angst.
Wait until God hears about this earth shattering news.
A holy catharsis.
Michael doesn't think they're getting the message.
The Broadway adaptation of Angels in the Outfield continues through June 26.
Dude, this angel dust is the bomb
It’s a earth-wide eviction notice . He claims to be Fred Trump, but we know that has to be a lie.
Wait, but won't lava come out?
Don’t look so glum. There are plenty of other hospitable planets in the universe. Plus this one is doesn’t believe in global warming.
It appears we're giving up on our mission to save the world
See? If the Earth was flat where would the candy go?
He's going to be so disappointed.
HA! There's a strong breeze over the pacific.
Don't worry! It won't get crowded up here when he breaks it.
If he misses again, the world certainly won't end with a bang but with a whimper.
I hate this “archangels go first” rule
Trump’s  version of a very wonderful and beautiful Mexican birthday party in heaven.
If he hits,we'll have a lot more angels up here
The Angels gave him his wings prior to spring training.
Not everyone's cut out for Avenging Angel status.
He wanted to go out with a bang, not a whimper.
I don't know about you, but I'm finding this to be more Trump's version of heaven than mine.
Wait till he finds out all that's left are a few lumps of coal and a $43,000 sound proof phone booth.
God bless Earth Day.
I think we should go back to hitting Uranus.
He may have the world on a string, but he swings like my nana.
I doubt there is anything good in there anyways.
This oughta show those flat-earthers.
After us, the Better Angels are up again, but we’re way ahead.
This supposedly is a proof of free will.
I've been banned since I wiped out the dinosaurs.
When she gets a good hit, all the lava comes flowing out.
Told you not to worry about global warming.
Could it be the Big Bang in reverse?
I mean, come on!
How many chances does he get?
He was Trump's EPA  chief,the pi
They think the shaking is from some shifting plates.
One thing I know, it's not filled with candy.
Gabriel likes to mix it up sometimes.
First thee get their attention.
I’ve heard nothing good could come out of this!
There goes the neighborhood.
So, what do you think, hit or miss or doing the  Lord's work?
In heaven as it is on earth,,,,
...if he hits New Jersey Jimmy Hoffa will fall out...
I don't think this is what Teddy Roosevelt had in mind.
He can stop.  The president will do it.
The word on the street is it's rigged, he sees through the blindfold and tariffs will be the least of Canada's problems.
We used to block out countries for salvation - but not anymore.
God believes this provides better odds than the way the Earth is being cared for now.
This looks bad. Shouldn't the horn section be tuning up?
After they took away Pluto, this is the only way we could keep the game going.
He's the Angel of Global Warming, and he never misses twice.
I'm not sure how many more direct hits it can take!
This one's more fragile than it looks.
Yeah, it's kinda mean but it's kinda fun too.
He's just bashing globalism again.
Apparently, the humans are not messing up the planet fast enough for our Angel Brother's taste.
He’s been connecting pretty regularly lately.
I know it's just a bit of fun, but I don't feel like it gels with what we're about here.
He may play for the angels, but he swings like a Met!
He played for the Orioles.
They say in Hell, you don’t even wear the blindfold...
Jupiter's easier.
He is trying to spank trump
I'm getting a little nervous. I still have family there.
That's one way to hasten Armageddon."
Ariel's  pretty uncoordinated. The last time he connected was in the Cretaceous
And they worry about global warming...!
You've heard of the blind watchmaker?  This is his evil twin.
He sunk all his money into TWA.
And he wanted us to call him Gabe Ruth?
Did you see that? She winked at me.
This used to seem like the dumbest thing you could do.
Aren't we supposed to do this AFTER the Rapture?
The last planet he whacked turned out to be Pluto and that didn't end well.
It'll give 'all hell breaking loose' a new meaning.
I think I am right in saying the left hand on top doesn't work.
At least this is more fair than the dart board.
Welcome to the world opener series.
Don't you think Babe's had enough swings for one year?
Hah, they’re blaming Russia down there...
Worst New Year's party, ever.
Major League career my ass!
He just hit Hawaii and Guatemala.  Personally, I'm aiming for the White House."
God knows what on Earth will happen!
After Gabriel crushes the Earth, let's go back to my place so I can tear up Uranus.
His last swing was an almost-miss; the bat barely brushed Kilauea.
He hasn't hit a lick since Bryce Harper went on the DL.
I hope he doesn't hit the Yucatan Peninsula again.
He's just going to get lava everywhere
We may as well have a party and enjoy it before it goes bad.
I actually heard some guy say that God does not play dice with the Universe. Wonder what he would think about this?
And they still think it’s climate change.
Apparently he struck out a lot with the Anaheim team, also.
They say the immigration lottery is even harder
Creationists' Outer Spiral Arm Concept Drawing
Reminds me of Trump somehow.
I got it on sale.
The winner doesn’t have to return.
He missed North Korea
I had something else in mind when John's invitation promised we'd "journey to the center of the Earth ".
The Angels take a lead in the Other-World Series
They need disasters from time to time to keep them on their toes
Do you think Phil knows his boy is still down there?
Don't worry about the giant lizards. They'll be fine.
Waste of time.  It's empty.
This is part of the new anger management program.
It’s a new technique from his anger-management group.
I hear say that it is filled with plastic.
It doesn't matter if he actually hits it this time. Earth is done for either way.
Swing low, Sweet Chariot
I always wondered what caused earthquakes.
MEGA. 
Make Earth Great Again
Do we have enough wings for another eight billion?
He doesn't play dice with the universe, but...
It's only a matter of time.
Did someone open the sixth seal?
Hades is just dying to play!
Can you believe people on Earth blame "fracking" for the rise in earthquakes.
It wouldn't be as much fun if the Earth was flat.
Scientists who insisted that climate change was caused by human activity go absolutely nuts when they see this.
This might hurt.
Dude has zero chance of being signed by the Anaheim Archangels."
'The last time he did this Trump was elected President!'
With any luck, we'll make it flat again.
How do you think we got rid of the dinosaurs?
Shouldn’t we tell him that’s not the piñata?
Your best bet is on America. I think I see a split forming.
I was led to believe that the recreational activities offered here would be music and song.
Rock candy.
It's exciting -- at any moment Trump's antics could change the trajectory.
I've heard that the candy is out of this world.
The Devil is batting over .400
You have to hit it once every 24 hours to keep it turning, even if blindfolded.
He always dreamed he was in the World Series"
And he thought the world was flat!
Ever hear the song "He's got the whole world in his hands" ?
First the dinosaurs... Now humans?!
There goes Michael: still trying to knock the hell out of it.
Given all that has gone on recently, the planet could use a good whack.”
Too bad it's not real.
No wonder my brother down on earth has migraines.
I don’t think that what he meant by “Why don’t you take a swing at it for a change.”
In the old days, we didn't have to wear the blindfold.
Wait until God finds out he's got the world on a string!
Let's give him another chance. We could all use a do-over.
He’s been at it for 4.543 billion years
They're so quaint, they have an entire religion called "plate tectonics."
They put all the best candy in Saturn.
That is quite a trick to play on a guardian angel...
He's been at it for years,  yet all he's doing is making for stronger winds
It ain't over till it's over.
I hope he doesn't burst China. I can't digest counterfeit candy.
It's Pinata Therapy for people who had bad experiences on earth.
He can finally have an impact on the world
He sits on the president’s shoulder.
I think it's time to take off the blindfold.
i just hope Ted Williams does not hear about this
When it's time for the annual softball tournament,we're gonna need our better angels.
And Earth thought hurricanes were an act of God.
The World is going to Hell!
Last time the dinosaurs died.
This is really how Earth ends, but my agent was right: the Four  Horsemen version IS a huge best-seller.
Last good hit got rid of the dinosaurs.
I wouldn't brag, you only had to hit Jupiter.
He can't hit here any better than when he was on the Mets.
Sure, he missed the Earth but he hammered that moon into orbit.
It's always mostly insects.
This is what happens when Earth Day gets confused with Birthday.
They'll call it a Madden-Julian oscillation; I say it's a whiff.
It's gonna blow up anyway.
The Republicans like Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
What on earth?
Hank, I have to go, and I'm taking my smoke machine. Don't call me.
God's got the world on a string sittin' on a rainbow. He'll never hit it...
Not to worry. It's on self-destruct mode.
Think Trump and swing!
It's really a hit or miss type of deal.
Apparently the prize motivates him, but he really needs to learn to care more about the welfare of others.
One strike and they're out.
Yeah, he made it, but sometimes God's strange moods just tick me off.
Too bad there's no candy inside.
It’s Kim’s turn now, Donnie.
It's never gonna happen, he's with the LA Dodgers.
Apocalypse when?
Cinco de Mayo was never this much fun!
Rumor has it that it was those tweets about Mexico that drove Her over the edge
It was either this or “pin the tail on Halley’s comet”.
Yeah, I'm with you, a bit overeager.
Maybe that's where our haloes are.
He has been doing this since the election. He thinks he doing the world a favor.
It's only a matter of time now.
Is that the one made out of cheese?
Well, the world's already going to Hell.
He was not much better at T-ball.
A split just opened on Hawaii. It should come apart with the next good hit."
He is experimenting with new ways of celebrating Earth Day.
Its your turn to intervene
This isn't bad, they use the sun in hell.
I'm not sure what I thought the End of Days would be like, but it wasn't this.
Winner gets​ to pick the next plague!
Blindfold, shmeinfold.  He's still dangerous.
Angel Trump continues to miss  but calls it fake news.
Who invited Global Warming to the party?
And you thought climate change was an imminent threat!
He just whacked Hawaii
Do you suppose this is part of God’s plan?
It's not a matter of if... it's a matter of when.
He's going for the Sixth Extinction.
It's anger management.  He was a better angel in the Lincoln administration.
He was big talk after Jupiter.
The Big Man couldn't quite nail it, so he decided to let us have a few swings at it.
It can't hurt.
Is the Apocholypse, or just global whaamin?
Well, for us it's lots of fun; they call it climate change.
We're taking turns playing Apocalypse.
This is how we play God!
Hoping he'll knock the Devil out of it!
Yes, Mr. President, you need to keep the mask on!
I miss the world, too.
Well, if bats come flying out, a lot will be explained.
At least he's not fracking.
He thinks of it as a couple swings, but it's four years down there
Does anyone actually eat the magma inside?
I don't think this is what Sinatra was singing about.
I hate when all the sin spills out.
A lot of hot air and greenhouse gases we expect
OK, Now try to hit something other than Kilauea
Strike three. Another eon!
And they say love make the world go round.
Mickey actually missed more than he hit.
Can it, here comes Jesus!
It's my fault.  He's been whiffing ever since I suggested he choke up on the bat.
Hit Switzerland and we get chocolate!
China and we get rice...
Is it Christmas already ?
This wills settle that flat Earth issue.
They ignored their better angels.
Do you remember Pandora's last party?
He delegates Acts of God to us.
Justice is blind, particularly if your global peace pinata is 
fake!
Finally, a GOOD compromise!
Not to be unkind, but we should hope he's a no-hitter.
I think that's the new, "extreme " version of Brexit.
At least we tried.
They say he played for the Mets.
I still say is cultural appropriation.
In the Old Testament days He hadn't yet thought of the blindfold.
Watch out; remember what happened last Election Night!
Just wait until it's El Nino's turn!
St. Peter made sure the Flat Earthers could play shuffleboard.
I told the boss it was a bad idea to give the job to one of our better angels.
I hate Cinco de Gaia.
I heard Dennis got Jupiter for his party
And God said, “Let there be candy.”
Between you and me, I'm glad Gabe keeps missing.
Well, since it's ruined anyway...
It's the only thing that planet is good for anymore.
We've got to send him back down.  He's just not ready for the Majors.
Call him off.  They're destroying it themselves.
I know the earth is filled with the goodness of the Lord, but just once I'd love some gum.
Heads up, Mars! He really got ahold of the moon on that one.
The Flying Spaghetti Monster wouldn't have missed...
I'm hoping for pennies from heaven.
Next we'll play pin the tail on the world leader.
This will really be the big bang!
Why do think we all keep missing it?
Very rarely does someone connect. I believe the last time we had some dinosaurs go extinct.
Be best.
Surely it can't make things any worse.
Don’t tell the big guy we’re doing this again. He’s still angry about Gondwanaland.
Well he's definitely no Donald Trump
I wish the Boss had more of an actual plan.
There are subtler ways...
With Pluto gone, this is the next logical choice.
So that’s how the world goes ‘round.
Brad, it's your 4.543 billionth birthday, can we try something new for a change?
Who says God doesn't  play dice with the universe.
If the earth was flat, how could we fit all the candy inside?
If he makes good contact...California’s history...
He works for Scott Pruitt.
It's inhabitants are making it competitive, but I think we'll destroy it first.
Head of a "pin" or "piñata"?
He's convinced he can turn back time.
He just found out the wife remarried.
Turns out God does play dice with the Universe
The winner gets Mars
For some reason, they're worried about trumpets blowing and 'seals' breaking.
And then, there was darkness.
I liked pin the tail on Venus better.
Now I see how the Los Angeles Angels got their name"
At the very least, expect an earthquake.
He's got the whole world in his hands,  everybody.. he's got the whole world in his hands.
Swing hard!  The president's up next.
The Mexican angels complained about cultural appropriation.
Maybe it's filled with kinky stuff?
This is why they're so damned fired up to get to Mars?
And to think some believe climate change is the biggest threat to the earth's future.
The game got a lot better when we started filling it with infinite gratification.
Last time we got dinosaurs...
Is this racist?
No one swings like Sinatra.
I thought you said he played for the Yankees."
Just wait till Trump gets here.
Wow, has he really hit D.C. each time?
Piñatarmageddearth Day
Okay, so he hits it, so who is the lucky one to gets tell God?
Lucifer's gonna fall if he keeps swinging like that
I wish Napolean Dynamite were here.
It's a perk of being a Horseman of the Apocalypse, but it's a bit too on-the-nose for me.
Sing faster, its been his turn since last January!
Oh God, he's going to be pissed when he finds out we forgot the Jujubes.
The seam in North Korea is the trick.
We don't play dice with the world. That was before Trump.
None of the good hitters can get up here.
He's still trying to make the Yankees.
Next we'll choose their president by pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey
And for all those years I thought the world revolved around me.
Silly humans, they think chaos is caused by a Trump tweet.
No worry. He's only trying to destroy it out of love.
And they thought climate change would be their demise.
That’s strike #665.
This is the Day of Judgement.
And.........this is how He keeps the world spinning?
I can't stand spiritual appropriation!
If it's candy in there, I call dibs on the Milky Ways and Mars Bars.
Try to hit it on North Korea so all the minerals will fall out...
It's full of starving children.
It can't be Ted Williams. He's still on ice.
Last year we used Pluto. Took him three hours.
The President wants to make sure Mexico knows he is very
serious about cancelling NAFTA.
Batta, batta, batta, batta, batta. Sa-WING, batta !!!
This got a lot less fun after 2016
Iiiit's a Wing and a Miss!
It is part of our new diversity sensitivity program 
in response to the Trump immigration doctrine"
A blind angel can beat a sighted devil any day.
After doing this for eternity, you'd think he'd be better at it.
It's only a papier-mâché world, hanging over a cardboard sea.
He does this every time he sees a new Star Wars movie.
Well, he did hit Kilauea last time.
Well, so much for my geology degree.
Do you suppose he has no idea there are no bleachers up here?
‘Cause we couldn’t get enough candy in the flat one.
She just thinks she's got the world on a string
Angels at play JUST BEFORE the dinosaurs went away.
It's a flat-earther birthday party.
Next year, let's play pin the tail on Jupiter
Michael always was a bully.
Looks like the editors of the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest are trying to find a funny caption.
I'm so relieved. They're starting to go bad.
If he hits, we're gonna be mobbed.
Looks like he’s still holding a grudge!
This could get interesting. He calls the stick his "Trump."
November 8, 2016
It may be sinful - but i wanted him to miss.
He was a California Angel and
couldn't hit the side of a barn
Surely he can't miss 2019 times in a row.
Look away, the magma's about to go everywhere.
This is the Cinco de Mayo from Hell.
Just wait, this is going to be even better than when we flooded it!
Relax Peter, it's just a prank.
The last time he hit it, a bunch of dinosaurs cane tumbling out.
He used to be in politics.
I'll bet we can trade him to the Mets
Yippee, blazing-hot magma for everybody.
How did we wind up in heaven anyway?
Sometimes Jesus is a tad vindictive.
He played for the Angels during their down years
He realizes we were told not to do this again after what happened in the last election.
There goes the Middle East again
He's no longer the world beater he was as a cherub.
After it cracks open, candy will fall out, and we’ll race to get as much candy as we can. But, I’ll collect more candy than you.
I wonder how the "Flat Earth" folks will compensate.
He only has until it blows itself up.
I always thought money made the world go 'round.
He can't hit Trump's curve balls.
Justice is blind.
No wonder they can't predict the rapture
Yeah, there could be some unseen consequences, but it's a downer to bring that up about at a birthday party.
It’s called an earthquake.
The idea that Earth spins around the Sun was batted around well before Copernicus.
It puts a whole new 'spin' on guardian angel!
I hear they call this a Piñata down there and it's full of candy.
Your turn, Donald
It's a compromise between the Electoral College and direct elections.
.... this is whirled peace?  on earth!
I think God's finally given up on Earth....
God only knows what’s going to happen once it breaks open
He thinks he can shatter the blind faith of the world!
I’d wager he was a former Met!
Apparently justice is not the only thing that is blind.
Science is right about everything except why the dinosaurs went extinct.
I just hope he leaves the ozone layer intact this time.
Is the end of this game near?
Wow!  If he makes contact, he's going to send that thing into orbit!
He’ll never bust it in 4.5 billion years....
They never took good care of it anyway
Three strikes and you lose your wings !
You see, there is no order to the universe. It's all random. How else could Trump get elected.
I understand Sinatra's version is the best, but this is a little ridiculous.
He has been practicing for over a year. It’s called “The Donald Thump.”
It feels like he's been at it for an eternity.
Our ruler is tired of rolling the dice.
To say, some earthlings think disturbances are due to global warming...
Blindfolded AND a poor sense of smell.
You know, Satan got it on his first swing.
Since missing the dinosaur asteroid he's really upped his game.
Let’s see how hard he can hit it this time.
If he is predestined to hit it, then I'm complaining to the Boss.
Played for the Cubs before he got here.
We’ve been trying to smash it for millennia without success.
It's just hot magma and the radio-active core in the center. It's just as well we miss.
Forgive me Sid but, this one time, I'm rooting against Gehrig.
He's been at it since the summit.
Hasn't been close in millennia.
They've got ice cream at the party downstairs... Wanna come with?
His batting average is 237, he's not getting in.
I kind of miss earth too.
Is this what happened to Pluto?
I doubt this is what Sinatra had in mind.
We're going to be here for eternity...
How long until tug of warring nations?
Every time he swings, Trump sends out another Tweet.
I've always liked pin the tail on the devil better.
This party isn't going to end happily.
He's nothing but solar wind.
I told him, fine, if you can hit it, we'll ditch the whole dinosaur idea.
The Mercator projection is sooooo 16th Century.
There's no candy in it, but it's completely covered with nuts.
So much for his perfect game!!!
We'll break it eventually.
If he's always that bad, Adam and Eve probably could have stayed in the Garden without fear.
It's no worse than what humans have done to it.
It's a good thing we do this only once an eon.
Oh, shit! That's strike three!
Tsunamis don't count.
And here we have the Mexican-themed recreation room.
And yet he looks down on us, as if he's a "better" angel.
We only play this when they predict the end of the world. He missed in 2012.
He mastered pin the tail on the donkey so now he thinks he can conquer the world.
It's about time, isn't it?
He thinks that piñata contains a heavenly solution to their troubles.
You said there'd be nachos.
Nice shot Gabriel! You got Africa again!
I hope we get dinosaurs like last time.
Fake Swing!
I believe that's what they call Percussive Maintenance.
You-know-who doesn't find this amusing.
It was either this or cornhole.
Remember that time he nicked it and all the dinosaurs died?
And on the 8th day,” am I right? Want more punch
I love that chewy iron-nickel center.
If we're the better angels, what does it say about their nature.
He thinks he can stand in the middle of Heaven, do this, and not lose his wings.
I think he learned it from his trip south of the border.
The Rapture just isn’t bringing us the talent we thought it would .
The last time we had a piñata, it was full of dinosaurs.
God throws the worst birthday parties.
No, there's nothing inside
You think we've had too many birthdays recently?
michael-avenatti-anthony-saramucci-donald-trump-michael-cohen-stephen-colbert-late-show-video-
He misses maybe once in five billion years. Watch what happens next.
Hard to say which is the bigger miracle that he keeps missing or that humans haven't completely destroyed it yet either.
Ok, but I’m taking it down in 2020
The new guy is Donald, and he took to the world piñata game instinctively.
This isn’t how I pictured global denuclearization would happen
He struggled in Little Angel League, too
Apostle Paul's idea?
Don't call it a comeback.
In human time, each swing is the length of a presidential term.
It’s just filled with used plastic bags.
NASA tracks our stick as a Near Earth Object.
After all that, I'm curious to see what's inside.
All of us will get a turn. These plastic coated ones are tough.
It's been 4 billion years...you think he would have hit it by now!
Reminds Me of an Angels vs Dodgers Game I Saw Once.
I heard that if he hits it open, hopelessness and mass destruction come out.
Aren't we a little old for this?
Since we all know how this is going to end, why do we keep doing it?
We could remove the blindfold and he would still miss the point.
They say his name is Lucifer, and he brought the bat from a place called "Hell."
Atlas shrugged off the catcher
So heaven is just a metaphor after all.
Take it from me - don’t eat the candy that falls out.
It seems so small now
This was more fun when there were dinosaurs.
This is how he picks which friends to embargo
I'd still say let's Mueller finish before we go global
Values?,.,,Just imagine it's Trump's head.
The boss said, 'Just don't think you'll get a swipe at the real thing.'
It maybe funny now, but wait till the boss comes back.
It's a little game we call Armageddon.”
He used to let us hit it without the blindfold, but lately He seems to be feeling sorry for it.
His name's Dave Kingman.  Used to play for the Mets.
It's no fun any more since they made the treats inside non-GMO, gluten and dairy free.
You know that’s not a piñata!
If he makes contact that will be seven more days of work for us!
He still thinks that it's all about him'
Don’t get too excited, this one’s only filled with nuts
I'm glad he missed.  All that animosity in the Western Hemisphere might be contagious.
I hear he came close a few millennia ago.
I guess we're just here to pick up the pieces.
He poopooed the analytics, failing to recognize that the earths gravitational forces require an adjustment to his normal uppercut swing.
I told him not to bat cross-handed, for God's sake.
Where did they find a tree big enough to hold it?
He was a solid hitter for the Los Angeles Angels!
This is why the Earth's round.
Last time? Hit Hawaii's sweet spot.
Well, SOMEBODY thought he was good.
Here I thought this was going to be “the end of the world as we know it”, but the good news is “I feel fine...”
Frankly, I don't think Casey could hit it without the blindfold"
I hear the dinosaurs are getting a little too cocky.
He doesn't have a prayer.
Once every couple hundred million years or so Michael takes a blind swipe at it to see if he can knock the magnet out.
He must have faked his resume'.
He never did have first-strike capability.
It's a very Zen thing...
They won't feel deja vu this time.
Wow!  They know how to throw a fun party in heaven!
It’s his earthday.
The last time he hit it, it was full of candy dinosaurs.
The angel who tortured Job still holds the record.
Talk about a change in the climate.
I shouldn't have told him there was candy inside.
When the Mets released him he wasn't doing much better
This is how Fate decides who gets the hardest hit during hurricane season,
That "Let's Make Heaven Great Again" stuff landed him here. He'll be swinging wildly here, too, for eternity.
With the current administration we can't play "Pin the Tail on the Donkey."
I heard the boss man filled it with molten metals and dirt. So I’m pretty excited.
I've heard of swinging on a star, but this?!
This was funnier with Jupiter.
You can stop. They're doing it for us.
I heard his bat isn’t regulation.
He said it's so easy, even blindfolded, he could knock it out of the universe.  I'm giving him three strikes.
The Big Guy's taking a nap, I'm guessing?
Look at us.  For a price, we change orbits -
And they still won't let Mexicans up here no matter how much we appropriate their culture.
All the fallen angels are left-handed.
Swing and a miss strike 3 and your out
Huh, I guess the Earth never really did revolve around the sun after all.
Is this the next phase of Climate Change?
If we used Mars we would have have less patrons up here!
This is going to hit the fan.
I think there's about to be a very big earthquake.
The Big Guy said if you're gonna play this game,you better be prepared to pick up the pieces.
So, is this really how Trump got elected?
Did your invite say 
"piña coladas served"?
If he breaks it, I'm going for the apple.
Ten bucks says nothing of value comes out.
So, who's going to break it to him that the clouds can't catch the candy?
Somehow, I don't think it's gonna be filled with candy...
We don't know what happens if we hit it, but it's bound to be interesting.
The last time he hit Earth the Dinosaurs went bye bye.
Each decade we lower the piñata another inch
Really happy he hit another asteroid.
It looks like a piñata, but it works like a voodoo doll.
You don't think that piñata is in bad taste?
His last party wiped out the dinosaurs.
Red hot candy is inside.
They always swing for the clouds at first.
What's with Him answering Bannon's prayers?
Babe who?
Good thing there's no people on it.
Missed! That's Michael! No Judgment Day!
Swing, batter, batter,batter,...Swing!
It's a break from our usual routine.
who took the blame for last week's Tide pods?
Tell me when I'm on point with U.S.A.
Play for the angels?  He doesn't have a prayer.
"Here's where Joe Di has gone.
'sall right. La Niña's on deck.
Considering the state of the world today... justice is blind.
The last time anyone hit it, a bunch of dinosaur toys fell out.
It's his quinceañero and he'll piñata if he wants to.
It's filled with AirHeads.
He needs to "swing like the devil."
St. Peter gets to vent his frustration on Cinco de Mayo.
I do actually prefer his mindgames..
4.5 billion years, and he hasn't hit it once.
It's papier-maché, but we did fill it with lava for authenticity.
Watch out. When it bursts shards of plastic will be everywhere.
"It's full of KCups and drinking straws unless you pray extra for candy."
We got the idea from one of their sci-fi movies.
He is no Angel.
Piñata? No, it's actually the Earth.
This is how we decide armageddon.
Ever wonder what lava tastes like?
I'm betting that God has some of those sinfully good salted caramels inside.
After they destroy the planet everyone gets goody bags.
One more miss and we'll need to call for divine intervention.
It's always about oil.
Huh-he got Pluto first try.
When the the species fly out its hilarious!
Who checked for nukes?
He’s been hammering on it for nearly a year and a half, but it still hasn’t quite broken.
God said He'd move Mars into the vacant spot.
Who have we got on the bench?
What do you think? One more swing or should we tell him that they'll take care of destroying the world on their own?
She's been trying this for a few thousand years now...
Earth's tricky, but they say he knocked Pluto out of the park!
He calls it “Trumpian.”
The birthday boy gets the nickel-iron core.
If he hits the US, the weakest part, get ready for thousands of immigrants to spill out.
He always sucked at sports.
Hurry up -- he's tweeting again!
Were you here for last year’s hurricane party? It was the worst.
She just missed Mar a Lago by a millimeter.
Once he smashes this baby open, hot molten lava will drench his whole body and send him straight to hell where he belongs.
When did we start playing this game again?
10 to 1 it's not confetti or candy.
In terms of global diplomacy, it's another swing and a miss.
You never know what kind of treats to expect ... But this one sure smells funny!
Actually, it was the ‘guardian’ thing that bucked tradition. This is so Old Testament.
But if you hit it, the same thing happens anyhow, right?
He's new here. Just reassigned. I hear he used to be Donald Trump's guardian angel.
I actually liked it better when God had us doing the Macarena.
Just wait till Pin the Tail on The Almighty...
Don't worry God made it.
And it shall rain candy and mercy
Do you think the candy melted too?
It seems that Gabriel is using his birthday as yet, another excuse to trigger The Apocalypse.
One more strike and he’s out.
St. Yogi Berra say that guy ain’t got beatific vision yet.
A graphic description of  The Big Bat Theory
I hope he's not expecting candy
Blind faith can hit a pinata but not a baseball.
He's been at that for over 4.5 billion years, but hope springs eternal, as they say around here. A lot.
I think it's on purpose. He doesn't want any of that stuff up here.
Scott Pruitt's Swing, it hits all of us.
Don't be concerned! It's his way of negotiating.
What does an angel have to do to get his swings?
He thinks he's back in the Bronx.
In the end times, he will connect, and there will be a separating of the candy.
The trick is to swing toward the hot spot.
It's part of the Boss's new multiculturalism initiative. Next week Thor is coming over to demonstrate hammer throwing.
I don’t understand what’s so fun about this. It’s just full of idiots anyway.
I used to feel like that playing golf.
The last time he hit it, a guy with orange hair was elected President.
Every time he gets close, the President tweets.
You still shootin up heroin?
Halley wiffs every time.
Funny, he doesn't look Latino . . .
I'll take the hard ones.  You can have all the soft centers.
He said no more flooding so we can’t bob for planets, but surely He won’t mind the piñata.
I hear they're thinking of letting girls join.
California has been thinking they're above us.
I hope you like salt water taffy.
Nobody has the heart to tell him that this isn’t Los Angeles and it sure isn’t the World Series.”
It's better than playing Pin the Tail on the Comet again
If he hits North Korea they'll be big trouble
Aim for the sky
That’s Mudville’s Casey!  He wasn’t much better without the blindfold!
Peter didn't know he juiced when he drafted him.
No body’s perfect, right?

Wait s second. He said to hold off for now. Darn!
We take the first hundred names, the rest go downstairs.

Two more like that and the send him back down
This is totally ridiculous. Seriously. Someone should make a caption out of this, and then mail it to that The New Yorker magazine before that Trump character has another temper tantrum.

Take that all you unrepentent sinners.  This is my revenge for your wild ways.
He's never really recovered from being assigned years ago to watch over the young Donald.
It could be worse. I heard that in the other place, you have to swing a pencil.
Up here you only get two strikes.
I didn’t think the last judgment would be like this!
Jeez, I thought you said he was a career .391 with the Red Sox?
God said to put it out of its misery, so we're going to find out what's inside.
Maybe this global warming thing is a hoax after all...
It's called Trumpinata
When do we tell him there's no candy inside
This is why Gabriel shouldn't drink tequila."

He aimed for the moon.
Do you think we should tell him he could destroy the boss's favorite toy?
Your turn.  Dizzy?
Since Trump arrived He has decreed that we try to hat him away.
He  thinks this is the solution.
Hope he doesn't hit California. My best buddy Frank lives there.
OK, he's been swinging for four billion years.  Time to take off the blindfold.
Well, that’s one way to fix the population problem
Isn't he supposed to be the one they call the 'Arc Angel'?
After the Old Testament was released, the boss instructed us to raise the level of difficulty.
Where did you hide the Cherubim, dear?
|"If he breaks it, everyone on Earth will know that global warming is real."
It is quite obvious who this guardian angel is assigned to.
Trust me, he is going to be disapointed to see what's inside!
He's pretending to be that fat guy with the orange hair.
And to think he won pin the tale of the fake moon landing.
It's Scott Pruitt. He says he missed a few glaciers in 2018.
We know one thing, Trump and Sessions won't be dropping in.

With that launch-angle swing, no wonder they’re experiencing climate change.
Three strikes and we'll write your orbituary.
Let’s give him one more term
I'm just saying that Global Warming is not just a matter of a-piñata.
Why can't we just let them live in peace ?
He was with the Los Angeles Angels before the trade but obviously hecom
Geez, he just barely missed it that time...

It's a fun way to acclimate newbies to our '3 strike' rule.
This is more fun than Pin the Tail on the Deity
It really is the luckiest planet, that's like 10 hits so far, should of exploded by now.
The next game is pin the tail on Uranus.

Nothing ever good out of  this.
If this flat earth society doesn’t take off .... and, given where we are, I don’t think it will ... you should go into party planning.
We have been swatting at this for millennia.

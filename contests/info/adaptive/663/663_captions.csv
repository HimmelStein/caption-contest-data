Next time, when they ask you if you want any toppings, you’d better be more specific than 'Yeah, a couple.'
You said you were in the mood for a little Italian.
OMG...Remember us...we were on your wedding cake!
I don't know either. We asked for a small table on the piazza.
You ordered Basil and Olive? Here we are.
Well, you're not what we ordered either.
Hello , we’re the Toppings!
Do you mind?  This is a personal pizza.
Finally, some service.
Didn't you order the two-person pizza?
Would you mind leaving the lid open? We’d prefer to dine outside tonight.
We’d invite you to join us but there isn’t mushroom in here.
Remember when you said there’s nothing worse than pineapple on pizza...?
Look up. You’re on someone’s pizza too.
You ordered a large pie and two sprites?
Well, we finally know what that plastic piece is for
Oh, little tip... the mushrooms might be hallucinogenic.
So he tells the genie, we want to eat pizza everyday and travel...
Little Italy - what about you?
The last thing we remember is the moon hit our eye.
Do you mind? We’re trying to think inside the box.
Hopefully, you two are vegetarians."
No idea. We were in our favorite pizza place, I told a joke, she said, 'Good Lord deliver us,' and the next thing we know....
It may be your night in, but it’s our night out.
Did you order two nine-inch Italians?
What did you think the shrimp special was?
You wanted dates on your pizza? You got dates on your pizza.
You think YOUR dinner is ruined?... I was about to propose!
Remember us from your wedding cake?
Hi, we're the Toppings
Could we have two more drops of Chianti, please?
What did you expect from Little Caesars?
We represent the shrinking middle class.
Honey, I don't think the kids will eat pizza with dates on it.
Yes, we're ready to order.
Hey don't look at me, you're the one who said you were in the mood for a little Italian.
You ordered two small vegans?
Finally. Could we please have our menus?
You said you wanted us for dinner.
It's a long story, but trust us. Don't use the coupon."
Hi, my name is Bob, this is my wife, Sally, and I am a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency of the United States.
Now you know what those little plastic things are for.
If you don't like them, you can just pick them off.
Stop hovering. We'll give up the table when we finish eating.
We met in Little Italy.
You ordered the small family size, right?
You're seriously ordering us to go?
It turns out the apostrophe in "Extra Small Meat Lover's" makes a big difference
I told the genie, "Make us a pizza". The next thing you know, we're here.
Hi, I'm Basil, and this is Olive
That's the last time I eat mushrooms as an appetizer.
Stare all you want, we're not giving up the table.
Well, you're not exactly what we ordered, either.
It wasn’t our idea either, we just asked for a little table for two.
Roger, I know said I  wanted 2 small vegetarians but did you have to be so literal?
I don't suppose you've seen our waiter, have you?
I'll bet you always wondered what these little tables were for.
This is what happens when they ask you if you want any toppings and you say "yeah a couple"
You ordered two small Sicilians.
Wait'll you see the box YOU are in.
"If  you boys would just call us more often, Dad and I wouldn't have to resort to this.
We could ask you the same question.
I ordered a single topping pizza, not singles topping a pizza.
This IS two small Sicilians and a plain.
Yeah, but things are gonna get even weirder when you look up.
Are you implying that we are NOT "hot and spicy"?
Well, you did order a small Sicilian and a small Neapolitan, right?
I think we are ready to order.
It does say, "a unique, fine dining experience inside each box".
Close the box and walk away. You saw nothing.
This is an awkward situation no matter how you slice it.
Greetings from little Italy!
I think it was the mushrooms.
Take what you like,we can't eat all of it.
Finally! No one has checked on our table in over half an hour!
Maybe next time pizza first, then drugs.
Well, we started out on wedding cakes but now we do just about anything, ‘xcept soup and barbecue.
We got tired of standing on wedding cakes
Well, you did order a couple of small Vegans.
We aged-out of that bride and groom gig.
We're from Little, Little Italy.
Wow that really does keep the cheese from sticking to the box
Maybe you're tiny people living in a pizza box too, you ever think of that?
Our last gig was on a wedding cake.
You think we have it bad? You two are actually in a giant calzone.
Oh look, the show is starting.
So that's what the little plastic thing is for.
“Sorry, pal—we’re Little Conceivers.”
Its hard to get a good table but the portions are quite large.
The tables are crappy plastic, but the pizzas are huge.
Hi, there! We’re the Toppings!
Finish your wine, Honey, I think they're waiting on us to close up.
We're the Toppings. I'm Jim, and this is my wife Edna.
Want some? The portions are enormous!"
We couldn't find the hostess so we just seated ourselves.
We asked to be seated in the piazza.
The service here is terrible and the floor is greasy.
Henry, did you order dates on the pizza again?
Having some wine. What's it look like?
Just eat around us
Just the check, please.
You asked for a pizza with Basil and Olive, right?
We didn't order you either.
We’ve been waiting 25 minutes to order, so YES, we ate all the pepperoni!
Take our advice:  don't eat the mushrooms.
Ya gonna stare all day or tell us the specials?
We also do weddings.
Makes you think about your place in the universe, doesn't it?
Seriously, who orders dates on a pizza?
I asked for Margherita on the pizza, not Mark and Rita
In all fairness, when she asked what toppings you wanted, you did say “surprise me.”
Well, I did order 2 small vegetarians.
We're the Toppings. This is Helen and I'm Bob
What did you think you'd find on a shrimp pizza?
Oh thank God! We've been trying to get that open for hours!
Well, what did you think these little plastic tables were for?
We're members of the upper crust
She's Olive. I'm Basil. What's the problem?
We'll be out of your way soon.  We have a wedding cake gig in an hour.
If you see our waiter will you ask him where our pizza is?
Of course it looks like a table. It is a table.
Please say you're vegetarian.
Well, you're not exactly what we were hoping for, either.
Ohhhh, hey, I think the edibles just kicked in.
Is it the weed or are you seeing them too?
Food's good.  Decor is a little cheesy.
Oh, are you closing?
Can you send our waiter over?
I told you not to order a pizza with dates on it.
You ordered the small Italian family style right?
Before you complain, let me just say she's a little saucy, I'm a little cheesy, and we've both got plenty of dough.
I ordered the meat lover’s not the meet lovers.
If you keep staring we'll eat slow and order dessert.
Can you give us another minute? I was just about to propose.
Delivery?  On Heavens no. We’re the DiGiornos.
Nice to meet you; we're the Garnishes.
All i said over the phone was surprise me
But we ARE the small "Meat Lovers!"
I take it you didn’t read the small print either.
If you think this is weird, look up!
A cabernet savignon for me, and another Chardonnay for the lady.
Excuse me, this is a personal pizza.
Little Italy. It's a thing.
If you are surprised now, don't look up.
You want a piece of me?
Finally! The waiter...
We ate the mushroom pizza Alice gave us.
Do you mind?  This is a personal pan pizza!
We’re just here to make the pizza look bigger.
This is the last time I order from Little Italy
It was at this moment that Ben realized the mushrooms on his pizza might not have been normal mushrooms.
To you, it’s a pizza. To us, it’s a hut.
Check, please.
So she said “Let’s find a nice table in the Piazza”
We know what you’re both wondering... How did the box close in the first place?
Do you mind?  We've waited 18min at 425º for this table.
Thanks for not ordering the calzone.
Look, Gulliver. It's the Lillipizzans!
What're you staring at, Einstein? You think you ain't standing in the middle of an even bigger pizza?
Well, that explains the beanstalk.
It's not delivery, it's the DiGiornos.
I have a feeling we’re not in Little Italy any more.
We booked it on OpenTable
We thought we asked to be seated in the piazza.
Didn't you order two small meat lovers?"
I don't think they got what they ordered either.
Then don't order the date-night combo!
You’re disappointed!? We asked for a table overlooking the piazza.
Excuse me Sir, but we're kind of in the middle of something.
So I say to the genie, how 'bout a nice romantic dinner on an Italian piazza?
We ate all your toppings.
Hurry up and eat. We've got to change for a wedding cake.
I told you it was only a matter of time before other people found out about this place.”
Maybe this tiny house thing has gone too far.
Did you order us or did we order you?
It was either this or we sat at the bar.
I knew we should have said no to the magic mushrooms.
And we’ll be leaving a tiny tip, too!
Please bring the check and a small ladder.
Hi- we're the Olives.
Can you close the lid, please? It's really throwing off the ambience.
Look, if you don't like us, just pick us off.
And you’re sure you said ‘two small meat lovers’ and not ‘two small lovers meet’
You can have our table when we’re done.
Did you order the pizza from Little Italy again
We asked for a table on the piazza.
Next time don’t order from Gulliver’s Pizza.
Would you like to join us?  This is way more than we can eat.
Well then you should have looked at the toppings buttons on the app more carefully. Now apologize to my wife. She’s not what I wanted either, but I don’t go around whipping boxes open and telling her.
Not nearly as surprised as we were.
Well what about OUR order?
Well I’ll be, every kid was right after all.
I thought we were avoiding Rosemary and Basil.
Hi, actually could we switch to a booth?
Can we get the check?
We're waiting on a pizza.
We’re re-enacting an old episode of the Twilight Zone.
If you wouldn't mind, it took us 30 minutes to get this table.
Did you order a small dinner for two?
Before you go doing anything crazy, answer me this: are you big, or are we little?
Hey, Tony.  Small world!
We were as surprised as you that this cartoon needed a caption.
Thanks for not ordering deep dish.
Sorry, this one’s occupied.
We're the Anchovies--who the hell are YOU?
We thought that WE were the upper crust.
Eat her first.  I haven't finished my wine.
Since delivery took more than 30 minutes, we’re free.
Dave, did you order dates on the pizza again?
We've finally made it into the upper crust.
What did you think we'd do after the wedding cake gig?
Originally, We were saving for a house, but now we just keep buying better and better Chianti.
We ate the mushrooms that make you small. Ask Alice.
Sometimes Pi is irrational.
We’re so excited you are finally having us for dinner.
Gulliver warned us about this place.
Small Margherita and Basil, no?
Sorry, we heard 'meet lovers.'
I thought we ordered it without shrimps.
You asked for a little Olive and a little Basil on your pizza, yes?
Thanks anyway but we've never been big on pizza.
Have you been listening the whole time?
Next time I think we should order the Vegetarian.
See? Pineapple isn’t the weirdest thing you can put on a pizza.
We are done-just waiting for the check
Didn't you order the pizza with dates?
We’re ready to order.
The food was good but the floor is rather greasy.
I don't like the way they're eyeing our rug...
Sorry, we ate your breadsticks.
I told you to call Jonathan's Swift Pizzeria, NOT Jonathan Swift's Pizzeria.
Well, next time I ask you what you want on the pizza, don't say 'Surprise me!' if you don't mean it.
We ordered in and got delivered. Go figure.
Close the lid our food's getting cold.
At least it's not anchovies.
You ordered the 'Cheese Lovers' didn't you?
Are we in your nightmare or you in ours?
Add this to pineapple and anchovies as things that should never be on pizza.
Did you or did you not ask for dates on your pizza?
This is nothing. Wait until you eat the mushrooms.
We’re the lovers. The meat’s underneath.
There you are. We're ready to order.
Didn't you order a small Neapolitan and small Sicilian?
Well, didn’t you order two small lightly sauced Italians?
Slight error. They thought you ordered WITH two people not FOR two people.
It’s a lot to digest.
Oh, sorry, we thought you had ordered a small piazza.
This is all-people. I ordered half-people, half anchovy
Please stop hovering! We haven't even had dessert yet.
We're not delivery. We're the Digiornos.
You might want to avoid the mushrooms.
We asked a genie if he could make us a pizza.
We may be the the 1%, but we own the pie!
The food is bad and the portions are small.
What?  You didn’t order the extra small, two topping, date night special?
Well, you ordered the two-person pizza...
We were hoping to be served, not be served.
Soooooo, do they tip or do we?
I SPECIFICALLY asked the hostess not to give us this table for this exact reason.
This is what you get when you order from Little Caesars!
We thought we were dining out on the piazza!
I always wondered what the little plastic table in pizza boxes was for, but obviously this raises more questions than it answers.
I guess they’re back on the sauce.
We used to live in a music box but the noise and the dancing were too much.
I know we probably look guilty, but the delivery guy actually ate most of it.
It's still better than Hawaiian.
Honey, what is a tiny straight couple doing on our pizza?
Let's see Dean Martin sing about this!
At least you have your food. We haven't ordered yet!
Excuse me, we're in the middle of a conversation.
Come to think of it, those mushrooms did taste a little odd.
It's YOUR fault! Who orders dates on pizza
Would you mind closing the lid on your way out?
Hello, we're the Pepperonis
Take out for you but it's eat in for us.
I've never had dates on a pizza before.
The lady said, 'For here or to go?' and we said yes.
This is so wrong, I ordered vegetarian.
One side makes you larger, and one side makes you small.
You can have our table, we are just about done.
That's correct. We are the Anchovies. I'm Dave and this is Gwen.
Why yes, our last name is Toppings! Why do you ask?
..and this is my wife, Olive. We're the Toppings.
When I ordered a pizza big enough for two people, I didn't realize the two people came with it.
Excuse me, but this pizza is taken.
Do you mind? We’re in the middle of something here!
You try finding a table on a Friday night.
So good of you to have us for dinner.
Hello. We're from Little Italy.
Staring won't make us leave this table one minute sooner.
What did you think the little table was for?
We're  just as surprised as you are!
You did ask for Olive and Basil.
We're still waiting for our salad.
Look, pineapple is one thing, but dates are where I draw the line.
Could be worse - at least it doesn’t have pineapple
Close the lid, I was about to pop the question!
We're sick of wedding cake.
And the strangest part of all this? Our last name is actually Toppings.
I'm Basil this is Olive.
Could you please ask the waiter if our small pepperoni is ready?
I asked them to top it with romaine and dates, not a romantic date.
We'll try your house red, please.
I thought "Diners to Go" was just a misspelling.
I guess I'll set the table for four
Look, your order form specifically stated ‘anything but pineapple.’
Well, you ordered the date-night pizza!
I don’t know, honey—I ordered Hawaiian but these people look French.
You ordered small ?
Could you leave it open? We were promised al fresco.
I hope you tipped the delivery guy at least $5 or this could be you.
Oh, sorry, is this a personal pizza?
Look who's here...its a small world, isn't it?
Ah man... I said meat lovers NOT meet lovers.
What time do you close?
Wait til you see what comes in your Chinese
Excuse me, we're in the middle of something here.
That's on YOU for ordering the 'small vegetarian'.
Well, there goes the ambiance.
You didn't read the fine print on the discount coupon, did you?
Is it okay we seated ourselves?
Well you did order two smalls.
The seating's a bit tight but the portions are huge!
We are trying to think inside the box .
I knew that little table was for something.
You ordered dinner for two?
What did you expect when you ordered dates on your pizza?
You ordered Marguerita. Well I'm her husband.
See Margaret?  I said, what kind of restaurant has just one table?
This table is taken.
Finally. Can we get some more parmesan?
Now that you've interrupted us, how about a couple of drops of Chianti?"
Oh, so thats what those are used for?
I always wondered what that plastic thing was for
Do you have a very small bathroom we could use?
Hi there,we're the Pepperonis!
You realize that one of us are dreaming.
Would you have preferred anchovies?
Did you even read the coupon?!
Nice to meet you.
We're the Chovies.
Andy and Ann.
This is much more civilized than our dining experience in the bucket of chicken.
I do hate it when the waiters hover!
So glad to see you found someone, Paul.
Rod Serling's at it again!
Don’t worry, we took off our shoes.
This dating app really delivers.
Waiter!...this carpet's disgusting.
I asked Karen & Fred to order the pizza. They weren't kidding when they said they were on top of it.
I always wondered what those little plastic thingies were for.
Welcome to Little Caesar’s. I’m the owner and this is Ann Chovy.
When you ordered the "cheese lovers topping" perhaps you should have been more specific.
I'm Al Fredo and this is my Aunt Chovy, just as you ordered.
We got tired of wedding cake.
There's your mistake:  it's a piazza.
I didn't think I'd like a 'pop-up' restaurant. I was right.
We ordered a small couple, of pizzas.
Could have been worse, anchovies.
Are you god?
I specifically said deep dish, not family style.
Now I've seen pizza with everyting.
We'd like the check when you get a chance.
It could be worse. We could be pineapple.
Sure it's small, but it's rent-controlled.
The last time I had this dream you weren't wearing pants.
Could you hold off on our order? We're waiting for a third.
You said anything but pineapple
Oh so that's what family-style is
Well,what did you expect?  Blackbirds?
Honey, I think there was something in the wine.
In a New York accent, "Hey, we're eating here!"
The walls in this place are like cardboard.
Just when I thought this blind date couldn't get any worse...
Good evening. I'm Hal and this is Ashley, and we'll be your toppings tonight.
You ordered a romantic dinner for two, right?
Well, excuse us, but we thought we were having lunch on the piazza.
We had reservations about the mushrooms too.
You're surprised? You ordered a plain cheese and then asked for a small couple of your customer favorites in the middle.
Oh well, still better than pineapple.
We are just waiting for the check
Great. They forgot the pepperoni.
Well, we weren’t expecting you either!
I always knew those little things did more than just support the lid.
You ordered the romantic dinner for two.
You can open the lid.  We're just making small talk.
They were out of meat lovers, so you got us wine lovers instead.
We asked to be seated inside...
You have to admit, a personal pizza doesn't get much more personal than this.
We’d like a to-go box, please.
The boys at Sal's have been playing with the 3D printer again.
We'll have a small pie, and a thimble of your house chianti.
YOU'RE surprised? We've just figured out why there's cheese all over the floor!
Are you the Donner Party?
Would you happen to have a late-harvest Reisling?
We ate the wrong side of a mushroom pizza.
I only ordered people on half...
We decided to dine in.
Yes, well, no more surprised than we are.
Would you mind closing the lid? This is a private party.
We’re the DeGiornos.  Who’re you?
Well, the coupon did say the extra-large feeds four!
Breaking news, you ruined our dinner, too.
When you order a small, you need to be more specific.
We're just in it for the dough.
Ready for some small talk?
Well, I did tell them to throw on a couple of shrimps.
Keep it open. We prefer alfresco dining.
You're the one who ordered a pizza with dates.
Oh, sorry, is this your table?
We have to stop ordering pizza from the same people who make wedding cakes!
You're right Caroline, they do look like people who would order dates on a pizza.
Probably good to be clearer when you order dates as a topping.
The reviews said the food would "transport us to Italy," but it looks like we only made it as far as 34th Street.
We discovered this pop up restaurant. Find your own."
Good evening, we're the Pepperoni's.
We're the Pepperoni's.  Fred and Lois.  You ordered small, right?
Hi. This is Ann and I'm Chovy.
You can have a slice if you bring us more wine.
If it's any consolation, we're not happy with our service either.
We ate your pizza.
The pizza was delicious. We'd like to see a dessert menu.
These two again?
Yes, we recall your wedding... and time hasn't treated you so well either, by the way.
They seated us, I heard someone yell, 'Pick up!' then everything went dark!
Hi, we are your surprise toppings.
Well, for the topping you said, "Surprise us."
Who puts dates on a pizza?!
Well, this is awkward.
Stop worrying! We put those plastic bag things over our shoes.
Your mother and I know that you’ve been smoking pot.
We ate the pineapple for you. You're welcome.
Could we get a table closer to a window?
Just recycling the plastic spacer; why do you ask?
Nice to meet you. We’re the Pepperoni’s.
Hi,I'm Pepper. I'm Roni.
What? You think they put these tables in here for no reason?
Well, they may just be "little plastic thingies" to you!
I said small Margarita  pizza. Not small people drinking Margaritas.
Ah, about time - bring us two more glasses of the house red.”
We have the table until 8:30. Then it's yours.
You're so fond of 'thinking outside the box,' you figure it out.
Close the lid! You’re ruining the ambience.
We're good to go.
I'm sorry, this table was reserved months ago.
Small world.
It's Gulliver's pizza, what were you expecting?
I asked them to hold the dates.
Who ordered two vegetarians.
Do you mind? It's date night!
Did you say feta or meta?
The wedding cake gigs got to be a little too precious.
we are retired wedding cake figurines
We're just having our dessert.  This table will be available soon.
You said you wanted a pizza with a little Aunt Jovi and a little Papa Ronny.
Did you, or did you not, order a small spicy Italian?!
You ordered the meat eaters pizza; we're the meat eaters
Can you leave the box open? It's a little warm in here.
Well, you wanted pepperoni, we’re the Pepperonis
We asked for privacy.”

“Yeah, well we asked for a vegetarian pizza.
First they put us under a vent. Now this!
So that's what the thing in the middle is for...
Care to join us? There's more here than we can eat.
Don't eat the mushrooms!
The mushrooms were amazing.
We believe the word is flat and divided into eight equal continents.
Sorry, but it was the only table available.
I can't believe it. They got the toppings wrong again!
It's a smidgen wobbly, mind sliding a pepperoni under this leg?
Apparently they gave us the wrong table.
Quick, act like an anchovy.
Bring us more wine from the mini bar.
The travel agent told us that this was Little Italy.
Never stiff the waiter at  the  PIZZA WIZARD.
We're the Peperonis who are you?
Pardon me, but we reserved the table two months ago.
I asked for a table for two, I wasn't expecting them to deliver.
We would like to see the menu.
When I said, "Two Italians", I meant something completely different.
Wow, 3D printing has come a long way!
Rats! I ordered date and prosciutto and they left out the prosciutto.
But I ordered vegan!
Excuse us, we were just in the middle of something!
Whatever you do … DON’T EAT THE MUSHROOMS!”
We both felt like a little pizza tonight.
Stop staring at my wife!
Honey, we need to send it back.. I specifically asked for thin crust, not upper crust!
Sorry, we ate your pizza.
I don't know where your pizza is.  We're waiting for lasagna.
There's a tiny problem with the pizza.
Guess my phone autocorrected pepperoni to heteronormative again.
The order said 'Surprise me with the toppings.'
Spelling matters.  I'm afraid you ordered a small piazza.
Then next time don't order the family combo!
I don’t know, it was the “Date Night Special.” You order next time.
You wiped your feet before you sat down, right?
I Thought, I ordered a vegetarian... Not two
Never tell a pizza joint to surprise you.
I think we've been served.
This is not what I meant by a couple of toppings...
Who ordered the magic mushroom pizza?
Maybe next time order mushrooms on the pizza. Not order pizza when you are on mushrooms.
My folks warned her--Marry him and you'll live in a cardboard box.
Don't worry. We removed our shoes.
Close the box! You're letting all the heat out.
Crap, they forgot the pepperoni again.
Please keep it down.  The kids are asleep in the breadbox.
Oh, we're sorry, this tables already taken.
We're sorry ... were those your anchovies?
Just because you set our table on your table does not make it your pizza.
Our portions were tiny, the AC seems to be broken — and the floor is disgusting!
Do you mind? We're trying to keep things in perspective here.
Help us Obi Wan Cannoli, you’re our only hope.
Disney was right I guess it is a small world after all.
Congratulations, you found a topping worse than pineapple.
What ticks me off is we asked  for a ' Table away from the kitchen'.
We're the secret ingredient!
Were you expecting a little red checkered tablecloth, too?
I know what you must be thinking. But please, we made this reservation two months ago.
Do you mind? This is a working lunch.
We wanted pizza that comes from Little Italy not pizza that comes with little Italians.
I knew we should have gotten Chinese
This is what happens when you order magic mushrooms on your pizza.
Whatever you do, don't order the "Shroom Special"
We're ready for the check.
We're never ordering takeout from Little Italy again.
And, if you see our waitress, tell her we're ready to order.
Your Italian is pretty good.  But you didn't order a small family pizza - you asked for a small family with pizza.
Honey, after miraculously surviving the fiery furnace, these giants don't scare me one bit.
I told you Fred that I saw little foot prints on our last pizza !
Ciao!  We're from Little Italy.
It's our favorite little Italian place
Did you accidentally order peopleroni again?
Oh, so we're interrupting YOUR dinner, is that it?
Excuse me, but this is a personal pizza.
We were a little short
How is this weird, Mr. “I-order-dates-on-pizza?”
Next time don't order from Little Italy.
I didn't know your parents were coming for dinner.
Can we PLEASE have some pizza quiet?
Hello. We're The Toppings, Ed and Sylvia Topping.
Pardon me - do you have any Grey Poupon?
All I know is we asked for a small table as close to the piazza as possible
We’re reducing our carbonara footprint.
Can't you see we're in the middle of our dinner?
I'll be more careful the next time I order a "Meet Lovers" pizza.
We started without you.
Didn’t you read the Groupon?
Fred and Eunice Topping. Who are you?
Could you close the lid? You're letting the heat out.
You just can’t find a hidden gem in the city anymore without someone else discovering it
We didn’t order this either.
So you're saying our pizza will have an even tinier couple at an even tinier table in the middle of it?
Do you mind?
Don't stare Celia, if they're not vegetarian we don't want to provoke them.
You didn't order a date on your pizza??
I always thought “family size” would be larger.
Well, this will make for one strange restaurant review.
You ordered "out"... We ordered "in"
Excuse me, but can we have some privacy here?
No, you ordered the MAGIC mushroom pizza.
Do you mind, we're having a box lunch!
Well then, next time don't order one with everything.
Did you order a pizza with dates?
What do you mean you are closing soon?
Just be patient, we’ll be leaving in a minute.
These days it's not enough just to have a wedding cake topper.
Yes, a piazza. What did you think you ordered?
We're the Pepperonis​, we had reservations for two.
You’re disappointed?!! We’ll never get the anchovy smell out of these clothes.
You never wondered why it was shaped like a table ?
I told you not to try to order in Italian!
I'm Fred, that's Margo; we're the Anchovy's.
We'd prefer it closed, if you don't mind.
Hey, Bill.  You ever wonder what those little plastic tables were for?
You ordered one with everything, right?
Would you mind closing the lid? we paid for the whole evening ...
We’re on a date. A little privacy please.
Would you believe we lost our wedding cake gig?
Now I see why this Airbnb was only 50 magic beans a night...
Well, since you never invite us over, we thought we'd try this.
Yeah, well we're not laughing either.
Yes, it takes BOTH of us to keep the cheese from sticking to the top of the box.
You must know Gulliver.    He's the travel agent who signed us up for this "Taste of Italy Tour".
You're right, when you order two people, they come with a free pizza.
This is not what I had in mind when I asked if you wanted to share a pizza.
Yes, you must listen to our Lilliput Island timeshare presentation before eating the free pizza.
I think I see the mix-up... I'm Ted Peppers and this is Abigail Bacon.
We keep the cheese from sticking to the inside of the box.
The wine is perfect, thank you! And we're ready to order now.
Can you give us a minute? We are in the middle of something.
Remember when we were happy like that?
Don’t mind us.  We already ate.
What are you staring at?  Haven't you ever seen a box lunch before?
How did no one say anything about this on Yelp ...
We're the Olives--who are you?
Gary, this is an intervention.
‘I think they ate the pepperoni ‘
We just want to be left in pizza.
Somehow, I thought "family size" would be bigger.
Luigi sent us.
For the record, we are in fact meat lovers.
But  you told ALEXA to throw in a couple of SMALL FOLKS with the order, didn’t you?
Do you mind? We are trying to eat here.
The toppings were great, but we left the crust for you.
Are we interrupting them or are they interrupting us?
Do you mind closing the lid? We're not done eating.
These cartoons are increasingly just stupid.
What are your small-plate options?
Hi, you must be the extra large meat-lovers.
We were downsized from the wedding cake gig.
What? Like you didn't know what  these were for.
It’s a small world,isn’t it!
Big portions, lousy ambience.
You wanted dates on your pizza? You got dates.
Well,...you did order the family size pizza.
I knew something was wrong when the lights went out.
You might have suspected that Restaurant Week meant smaller portions.
Yeah sure, like you never thought of this.
You ordered a plain cheese and two small Italians, correct?
Family size just isn't what it used to be.
Would you pass me a flake of chili pepper?
And WE weren't expecting a bumpy ride on the back of a motorcycle!
New Yorker Style Pizza
Actually we ordered a table at a nice piazza.
You did say "literally" when you ordered the pizza lovers special.
Yes, we ordered a "large" and you must have ordered a "small."
Jim, did you order extra toppings?
Oh and I bet THIS is somehow my fault too.
Get your own!
Finally a vegetarian pizza made with real vegetarians!
Mind closing the lid? We're on a date.
Did you order Sicilian or the Lilliputian?
You’re pissed? We spent eight minutes in the oven!
A caprese salad and Steak Diane.  What are you guys having?
Did you order a wedding cake or pizza?
They usually get out before delivery and just leave the little table!
The portions at this place are huge.
Death is not the end.
Hon, Did you order the two giants?
Excuse me, this is a private luxury box!
Did you say light on Sardines or Sardinians?
You ordered Dinner for Two, again?
Hurry up and finish, honey. I think they’re going to close soon.
What—you think these tiny tables go to waste?
Now I know what that little round thing in the middle of the pizza is for.
Will you let our server know we have a seven o'clock show to catch?
Really?  It looks like a little table because it IS a little table!
I've always wondered what that little thingy is for.
Not to worry. We eat very little.
These are not the small Hawaiians I ordered...
Could you get our waiter? We'd like more wine.
It’s called a personal pan pizza for a reason.
No, they didn't get your order wrong. We're the Anchovies.
Yes, we did clean our shoes; which piece would you like?
You said you wanted the meet lover’s pizza, right?
Oh, this is what the "Out-of-Box" experience looks like.
They told us we'd have the table until at least 8:30.
If you continue to rush us, don't expect a tip.
Oh, we're the Mozzarellas.
We're on a food tour of Little Italy.
I always wondered what that little table was for...
Go ask Alice.
Look, we're not exactly thrilled about this table, either.
You may want to avoid the wild mushrooms for obvious reasons.
I thought we had this table until 7:30.
I know, but do you have any idea how hard it is to get a table at this place?
I told you Hank, no one orders dates on a pizza.
Who orders dates on a pizza, anyways?
Wow!  Last time we use a discount coupon.
Sorry, I ask him to think outside the box this time for a date night plan, but here we are again!
OK, that's the last time we order mushrooms with the pepperoni.
Another pizza place ruined by tourists.
They said we'd be living in a shoe box if we moved to New York. Well, look at us now!
I'm curious, exactly what did you order?
At least they’re not pineapples.
What makes you think we ate it?
Can we get a little more pinot noir please?
You ordered 'Family Style', not 'Family Size'.
What'd you expect from little Italy ?
Every large pizza comes with two smalls.
"Well, this just tops everything"
Hi, we're Mama and Papa John.
We used to be you !
Which mushroom pizza did YOU order?
I told you it was too easy getting this reservation!
Can you give us just a few more minutes, please”
We're closed for Shabbat!
Don't look up.
Excuse me...have you seen our waiter?
Because every place in Little Italy was booked.
Hope you’re Vegetarians.
We're the serving suggestion.
Well, we are both lovers and vegetarians...next time, be more specific.
It's a new little pop-up.
You wanted the spicy Italian? You gotta the spicy Italian!
Yeah, I'm Little Caesar. You gotta problem wid dat?
Thank You! We PREFER al fresco!
It's not what we ordered either.
I asked for pepperoni, not people only.
Would you mind closing the lid. We’d like some privacy.
I know you guys said 
You felt like a little Italian.
No anchovies this time. Good.
Well, at this point, it’s either eat or be eaten
...and she'll have the linguine carbonara and a water, no ice.
And this is why the table nearest the kitchen is never a good place to be seated.
I guess we weren’t clear when they asked us “take out or dine in.”
Thanks so much. We were feeling so boxed in!
And you are...?
We were hoping for a quiet evening by oursselves.
You're going to love this Magic Mushroom pie as much as we do!
Hey, we were here first.
this is family size.
Ugly sweater, Chad. Now shut the lid.
Wait until you see what's in the antipasto salad
Could someone summon the Sommelier please.
Would you mind closing that? It's letting the heat out.
But we ordered a same sex pizza.
It's our new promo... small pizza with peopleroni.
Get your own table!
What exactly is the meaning of "Fee Fi Fo Fum"?
Yes honey, these are the Toppings. Frank and Eleanor Topping...
Yeah, well imagine *our* surprise when we realized the telemarketer's angle on a free 'Italian vacation.'
Sorry about your pizza.  We got hungry on the way over.
Extra large with 'Surprise Me' topping' is our favorite, too."
Damn dyslexia! I meant to order a ‘family-size’ pizza!
Keep a lid on it, will ya?
Not quite what I had in mind when I ordered 'family size'
Avery? Is that you? Small world.
Ask them where they got the chairs.
Did Rod Serling answer the phone when you ordered from Twilight Pizza tonight?
Despite pinching pennies in retirement, Susan and Rick will never order the "Surprise 2 for $2 Topping" on their pizza again.
We’ve been waiting 15 minutes for you. May we have menus, please
Those are the two weirdos who ordered dates on their pizza
Would you mind closing the box? I think he's ready to propose.
Thanks!  It was like a sauna in here.
Please move us to a table away from the kitchen.
This is the ‘’meet lovers’ pizza!
Do you mind?  We're having a private conversation here.
This is the hottest spot in Little Italy.
Okay, this is now officially the worst dining experience ever.
No, we're not gluten-free.
You’re walking on thin crust, buddy.
Next time please specify: Hold the Throckmortons.
This beats the top of a wedding cake and it comes with a table!
Keep the damn thing open for a while, will ya?
I thought they did away with the “happy meals” surprises.
Would you mind not slamming the lid?
The Groupon said dine-in only.
You ordered a small vegetarian and a small Hawaiian?
No, we're not Sicilian; we're Neapolitan.
Pleased to meet you. We're the Pepperonis.
You’re ruining the ambiance.
We're the 'couple of toppings' that you ordered.
Finally! We’d like a half cheese, half pepperoni.
the fuck you lookin' at?
Can you close that?  You're ruining the ambiance.
Won't you join us.  We're the Pepperoni's.
Close that lid right now or I'll give you a pizza my mind!
We ordered the extra small. Still waiting...
You must be the Pepperonis.
You're not exactly what we ordered either!
Hi!  We're Edith and Ralph Pepperoni.
So Miss Modest here tells the Genie, “to be honest, we just want to downsize and do some traveling.”
It was either this or subletting a calzone.
They always screw up the toppings!
I specifically told them 'no anchovies and no miniature people.'
We booked three months ago.
I don’t suppose you know what happened to our appetizers?
no we are not taking off our shoes!
You think this is awkward, our friends got delivered in a calzone.
Geez, that was rough!  Which one of you drove home?
That's us, Tony and Annette Pepperoni.
You order pineapple on your pizza you get leprechauns. Thats life.
Geez! No one can have a candlelit dinner these days.
When your this small, you develop a thick crust.
Could you bring us a couple of candles, and then close the lid, please?
We'll never trust Zagat again
We're just as surprised as you are but I guess you have to think outside the box.
Why so surprised? You ordered the party pizza.
You act as if you have never seen the inside of a computer before.
I’m Angela and he’s my husband Anthony. We’re the Pepperonis.
Close the damned box — you're letting all the heat escape!
Would you care to join us?
It smelled so good we couldn't resist.....
You ordered the 'unique dining experience' pizza - delivered.
We’ll have a bottle of your finest wine.
Sorry, we thought this table was available.
Yeah?  Well who's that up above looking down at you?
Do you mind? Our dinner is getting cold.
We think your eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
Oh, you'd better believe this is going in my Yelp review.
Focus groups suggested we would make the pizza seem bigger
This is the last time you get to pick the toppings George.
Look, kid, you ordered a two topping pizza. Well, I’m Jack Topping and this is Harriet, my wife. Now you got exactly what you wanted, so quit your bellyaching,
Oh good, you're here - I'm ready for that second glass of wine now.
Can we get some more bread rolls? And, when will our pizza be ready?
This isn’t the quiet dinner I had in mind.
We'd like the check now, please.
You ordered a large peopleroni, right?
We asked to dine in but got take out instead.
But you ordered it with everything
We decided to begin without you."
You did order the "Hello, Dali"?
Do you mind closing the lid? Pizza's getting cold.
'Quick! Pretend we are anchovies and hope they pick us off.'
They did it again Ralph, people instead of pepperoni.
Everybody thinks it’s to keep the box top from smushing the pizza.
Lisa, meet my parents.
Did someone order two 12-inch Italians?"
You said we ordered the meat lovers?
Call them back, we got those people in there again.
Papa John said what?
Are you the entertainment?
Would you mind cutting up a slice in one inch pieces for us?
Pizza-A-Boo!
Mr. and Mrs. Gulliver I presume.
You're letting out all the heat.
Didn’t you order ‘any two toppings?’”
Any idea when those salads are coming?
Why else would someone put a table in every pizza box?
Hey! Can we get a little privacy here? I was about to propose.
We've been downsized.
You said you wanted a surprise topping.
You were expecting anchovies?
See, this is why I always get DiGiorno.
Do you think we should get a divorce?
Do you mind? You're destroying the ambiance.
Sorry folks, we have reservations.
That's it, Barbara!   We're moving to a corrugated community.
The heated floor is nice.
We asked for "to go" and here we are!!
Don't look so disappointed. We were expecting pizza too.
Well, it's not like I'm sitting on a pile of dough!
Do you know where the bathroom is?
Sorry, you ordered a small---we ate it.
A word to the wise, never send a pizza back to the kitchen at a Sicilian pizza joint.
We should report them. They are probably here illegally.
Yes, we're Hawaiian.
We are your subconscious saying you really want to go out to eat.
Excuse me,we're trying to enjoy our pizza hut.
You say “pizza”..... I say “piazza.”
So you expected a pizza?  So did we!
What? I told you we were having Jeff and Susan for dinner...
See darling, I told you the Earth is flat.
I knew that Groupon for dinner on an Italian Piazza was too good to be true!
Oh, that’s what they are for.
'It's just a cheesy little date night.'
We’d like another thimble of Chianti.
Do we LOOK like anchovies?
I hear they eat the left overs.
Who ordered the personal size pizza?
What’s with the forks?
Everything is fine. We just kneaded the dough.
Hey, if you wanted privacy you should have ordered a calzone.
If you see our waiter, can you ask him where our appetizers are?
Maybe the next time you order the "2-for-1" special, you'll actually read the fine print!
I see you live in a box too.
Honey, did you order a meet lovers pizza 
instead of meat lovers pizza?
Phil and Marlene Anchovy.  Who are you?
We ate all the pepperoni. Now close the box.
This IS extra-cheesy.
Yeah, we’ve been waiting for our pizza too!
Hi. We’re the Pepperonis.
Nice try gentlemen, but clearly this box is taken.
I knew I shouldn't have ordered mushrooms.
I'm sorry. Were we expecting you?
Little Caesars.
Ken and Barbie were downsizing, so we scooped it right up!
Close the box -- you're ruining the ambience
This might be the right time for you to start thinking outside the box!
We couldn't get a table at the restaurant so we got one to go.
at least the cheese is  not stuck to the lid
Next time, tip.
Hiiii! I’m Bob. This is my wife, Betty. We’re the Anchovies!
I could swear he told me we would eat dinner in the middle of a PIAZZA.
Sorry. We were a little hungry."
You did order a pie with dates.
Don't worry, you can always scrape them off.
How long before the pizza gets here?
Big Tony, I presume?
The food is good, but the ambiance leaves something to be desired.
The good news is we didn’t walk around much.
Thanks...it was getting abit stuffy in here.
I guess we should start eating outside the box.
It’s hard to think outside the box.
"It's cheesy, but I was about to propose.
This isn't what I thought "meat-lovers" would mean.
We're centrists.
At least it’s not pineapple.
What did you think this thing was for?
These aren't the toppings I ordered.
Better us than anchovies.”
This is why we always check the box before leaving the store.
Don't forget to write a review on Yelp
Then what *did* you order?
So, are you two guys together? Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Yes, this is the small party pizza.
We never agreed to think outside the box.
The last we remember is complaining about the sauce to the pizzaiolo's grandmother.
We were hoping you’d have a little cabernet.
Next time, don't order the mushroom special.
Bernie, I've told you a million times to watch your diction when you order a personal pan pizza. They sent the person in pan pizza again!
There's hair on my pizza.
I think you've confused 'A Little Taste of Italy" with "A Taste of Little Italy".
Mabel, I said I just wanted a small dinner, not small diners.
Could you please grab our waiter?  He’s with the breadsticks.
We weren't dressed right for the wedding cake.
Next time let’s go without the mystery topping.
You should look up.
It was delicious
Either way you slice it, we are what you eat.
It was your idea to have the Smalls to dinner!
We're about finished, so you can have our table.
Have you ever heard of knocking?
I know, right? They call it a regular, but let's face it, it's a small.
How do you do? I’m Pepperoni and this is my wife, Olive.
No, "Meet Lovers Pizza" was not a typo.
Are you ready to take our order?
Are they at least Sicilian?
Well this does make your order extra cheesy.
I shouldn't have asked for everything on it.
It's a little undercooked.
Does a light come on when the  box is closed?
Do you mind?  It's date night for us too and we just sat down.
Not shrimps again!
This is the last time we ask for a table for two close to the kitchen
Gulliver’s Pizza almost deliver on their promise”
We come with the "Meet Lovers" pizza.  Did you want "Meat Lovers"?  You'd be surprised how often this happens.
Can you please tell our waiter we need another bottle of Chianti.
Sometimes you feel like a little Italian
Pizza Hut introduces the new Weed Supremo.
Our friends told us it’s a cheesy restaurant, but we had to see for ourselves
Well, you ordered a large with everything. We're the Brockmans.
People who complain about pineapple on pizza have never had dates on a pizza.
They were out of  mushrooms.
They didn't have a booth."
New York is really big and scary, but you can't beat Little Italy's cuisine.
This is the hottest place in Really Little Italy.
At least it's not deep dish.
Close the box Ma, I was just about to pop the question.
Waiter,this table is wobbly,and the floor is sticky!
The waiter asked us if we wanted “take out” and I guess that’s what we got!
We're the house special.
Well we heat the oven to 375 degrees, so you decide.
Where’s my meds Mike?
That’s what that middle thing is for!
Did you order vegetarian?  This looks like Olive and Herb.
You said you wanted a pizza for two with everything on it.
Of course we are GLUTEN FREE.
Why else would this little table be here?
We weren't happy with our order either.
I ordered pizza for two--not two for pizza.
I swear the family-size gets smaller every year.
Little privacy?
Next time, don't order it with everything on it.
We’re tired of wedding cake
Can you close the box, dude?  Your man boobs are 
totally killing the mood
YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE TWILIGHT ZONE?
We asked to be seated away from the kitchen.
They Said It Would Serve 4
Well, this still isn’t as weird as pineapple on pizza
Son, your Mother and I are on our Date Night.  Close the lid.
Not the topping you ordered?
But I ordered a large psilocybin mushroom.
It's not what were expecting either.......
Yes, we're ready for small plates dining to run its course, too.
Sorry to interrupt date night, but do you know where all the pizza went?
We ordered pizza to go, too. What's your point?
They did advertise dine-in and delivered.
Oh, thank god. I don't think I could've taken any more of this small talk.
Just a couple of small things about your order.
Shut the lid, would you? The pizza's getting cold!
I will never order pizza from Jack and Jill in The Box again
This wasn't my idea.  The pizza delivery guy thought it would be hilarious.
The Couple of toppings you ordered
You ordered from Little Italy?
Sorry, sir - I believe that we reserved this table until 9:30 pm
Maria and I didn't know that on Tuesday night at Mystic Pizza you could volunteer to be part of a magic show!
Imagine how we feel? We just wanted a quiet moment and a bottle of Chianti
You ordered two smalls, right?
Be careful when you say,’I really wish we could downsize.’
Do you see the eye in the lid of the box? When the moon hits it, that's amore!
Did you guys bring your own wine and chairs?
Here we were having a nice conversation until you went and opened our box with your big hands and your big face and your stupid big clothing.
You know you've thought of it too.
Sorry. We distinctly requested a table on the piazza when we made our reservation.
They said this was the only table for two available!
Welcome to Gulliver's Pizzeria.
"Oh good! we were just starting to think outside of the box."
Honey I think we got the wrong table.
I have a feeling they’ve confused our orders.
I'm thinking separate checks.
Pardon me but this is s personal pan.
Well, you did order the vegetarian pizza. Although technically I’m vegan and he’s vegetarian.
Do you mind? It's our anniversary!
I told them to put on a little of the toppings, not the Lilliput Toppings!
See, even this guy takes her out for a real dinner.
It's a GPS mistake. We don't like it either. It's hot, muggy and smells funny in here.
Thank you. This pizza was just the right size for the two of us.
Again! I was very specific,no Lilliputions! I don't care if  they are wild caught.
Comes with your Prime membership
Which topping DID you order?
So much for a romantic dinner.
Don't ever complain at Lil' Luigi's about sitting near the kitchen.
Do you mind?  We're just looking for a little piece and quiet!
As they say, you are what you eat.
Hey!  We've been waiting for this table for 45 minutes!
I ordered feta, not meta.
You said you wanted "a little Italian."
This table sucks, we're lookin' right into the kitchen
No, we can't get up. Our feet are stuck to the cheese.
Since we sat down at this table it's been a nightmare.
Now, may we please see a menu.
Ahem, you're ruining our pizza and quiet.
We’d ask you to join us but we’re a little short on dough
Top this!
You knew this is not what I meant when I said a little Italian sounded good.
You did ask for the "Italian Family Style".....
Well, you did order personal size.
Delivery from Little Italy?
What did you expect from Amazon?
They're nice.  But they're not what I ordered.
Sorry, there was only enough for us.
Well, that review did say it was a whole new perspective on the dining experience.
We've been waiting for an hour.  Where's our waiter?
Yeah, we know.  It makes no sense whatsoever.
I’m sorry but you ordered a pizza with everyone on it!
We ordered to go!
What?! This isn't what you were expecting when you ordered the date night special?
Do us a big favor. Think outside the box.
Don't mind us, we just like to eat inside the box.
I  thought we ordered the anchovies.
A little privacy here...
We saw this little table and thought it would be the perfect place for our dinner date!
The tux and gown are only for the wedding cakes.
We are trying to make the most of that lab accident.
You won’t believe what I had to go through to get this reservation.
I didn't order a pizza with dates.
If you plan on joining us you'll have to bring your own chairs.
Do you mind? It took us four months to get this table.
you searched for romantic DINERS to go?!
Can we get a 'to-go' box?
So,that's what you're supposed to do with that little plastic thingy...
What kind of mushrooms were on this pizza?
Now you know what what this little thing is really meant for.
Are you our waiter?
smallest popup restaurant ever
Well what did you think they meant by personal pan pizza?'
This tiny house fad has just gotten out of hand
Sorry, we were drinking and forgot to get out of the box.
Hi,We're the DiGiornos.
Any way you slice it, we’re not leaving!
We're Pie Protection Services, we have a right to be here.
I said I wanted "vegetarian"...not "vegetarians"!
Don't order the pie with
"magic mushrooms".
It's not like we're as controversial as pineapple toppings.
Sorry, we were here first.
Size matters?
You wanted a vegan topping?  Well, we're both vegans.
Now you know why the restaurant is called "Little Italy".
We order you to take us out.
At least they aren't pineapples
Do you mind? We're trying to have a quiet dinner here.
We’ll be done in 30 minutes or less.
Could we get different table? This one is a bit wobbly.
So what were you expecting from Lilliputian’s Pizzeria?
The pizza is great but the atmosphere sucks.
We saved the crusts for you
It’s like looking in a mirror, but 500 pizzas ago.
You don't want to know what we found on our pizza.
Hey, its a small world after all.
Thank you for not ordering anchovies.
Could you keep it down?
Bite me.
Gulliver, I found your toys!
Well, at least you finally know what these things are for.
We asked for a cozy corner but ended up in this box.
Watch out for the mushrooms.
This isn't our order, Albert. This is the Smiths!
You asked for the Anchovey's.  I'm Bill and this is Maude Anchovey.
Congratulations, you’ve been selected to participate in a customer satisfaction survey.
It’s a matter of perspective.
It's okay--we're gluten free.
Call Ant-Man. Tell him we found his parents.
Could we see the menu now, please?
They seem very upper crust.
It's cheaper than a taxi.
Dang. It's the Anchovys again.
We were going to leave but our feet are stuck in the cheese.
Could we see a dessert menu!?
Dining on pizza tonight was clearly our idea first.
I specifically said no Dates ...
No, sorry, we're not recyclable either.
The drinks are great, but the decor's a little cheesy.
Oh, sorry! We thought it was an empty table.
He said his brother was out of town and we could use the place for the weekend.
Happens all the time.  You ordered two individual pizzas.  We're the two individuals pizza.
Hey, Buddy! This is a private party!
Your daughter seated us.
It's a compromise.  She wanted take-out, I wanted dining in.
It was the only table we could get!
We prefer dining in.
Are you related to Gulliver?
We elected to dine in!
Cheese!
They're right when they say it can feed a family.
This is the special from Gulliver’s Pizza.
Our job is to prevent the cheese from sticking, but our passion is making sure you leave 5 stars.
I love meat lovers pizza
We're the Anchovies.
I swear the Lilliputian Pizza came with three last time.
Do you mind — this is a private party.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
Could you close the lid?  That ceiling light rather spoils the mood.
Just what type of mushrooms did you request?
I say Pinot Grigio is the best choice. She says a Merlot is a better pairing. What do you suggest?
You may have ordered Take-out, but we ordered Dine-in.
Are we still in Brooklyn?
So that's what they mean by personal pizza.
We just want a little pizza and quiet!
It's from Little Italy!
This place makes the best meet lovers pizza.
I asked for a little parmesan but I guess they thought I said a little Pam and John.
Quit trying to order dates on a pizza. It's not a thing.
I asked for a two-person pizza...
Wee deliver!
Do you mind? We asked for a private table.
Ugh, they gave us the Robertsons instead of the Mitchells.
OK, we’ll leave. But we’re taking our chairs with us!
Really..? Who owns a two-legged table?
Can I get some service over here?
Never mind that Jerry! But are you sure it’s gluten free?!
Since you ordered the extra-cheesy, the engagement ring is in her glass.
You ordered a personal pie right?
We’re just thankful they didn’t seat us in a calzone again.
Yes, hi, we're the Crusts
Is it too late to change our order?
It was all we could get on short notice
Yes, exactly! I'm Basil, and this is my wife Olive.
You could at least have taken your shoes off.
Thank God you didn’t order the calzone.
Hey! We ordered the private dining experience!
You guys better be vegetarian!
There are healthier options.
Uh,.... 7:00- What time was yours?
We chose the dine in option.
They really need to take the Russian Doll Pizza off the menu.
We've had three glasses of wine.  Could we PLEASE see a menu...
She said 'Okay so where do we eat,' and I said 'Tonight let's think out of the box.'
We enjoyed the garlic appetizer. What are the mains?
Don’t ever order a mushroom pie!
Sorry. ‘OpenTable’ seems to be having some scheduling problems lately.
If you wanted us bigger, you should've ordered an extra large.
Well, I'm Tony Anchovy and this is my wife, Elaine.
Blame the app.
Please call for help.
Uh, it's not what it looks like!
Steve Peppers and my wife Olive. And you are?
We’re from that Matt Damon movie nobody went to see.”
Consider ordering a large next time.
Can’t you see were having a private conversation?
How much did you tip?
We have a reservation.
Is this Stuart Little's house?
No, we're not delivery.  We're the Digiorno's.
Glad it’s not a calzone?
Piss off; we're Welsh.
I’ve always wondered what the tiny table was for...
First home delivery from Little Italy?
So much for personal pies...
You want a pizza me?!
You've been served
Honey, in New York you have to enunciate.  It's pizza in a box NOT piazza in a box.
Slice of Life
We were here first
Close the lid - we're getting cold.
We love what you've done with your pizza box!
Have you entered the Twilight Zone, or have we?
I told you to order pepperoni.
Next time ask for extra parm so we don’t need to bring our own chairs.
This was the only way we could get here in 30 minutes or less.
Oh no, not again. More of those giants who eat the floor.
I told you, don't order from Little Italy
Wow, the daily special was literally a "Couples Pizza" !
Then the genie says to me:  “What a stupid goddamn wish!”
The new Little Caesars 2 for 1 deal.
I always wondered what that little plastic disk was for.
We're the Petersons, they were out of pepperoni.
They told us we'd be dining on the piazza.
AHHH, giants!!
Did we invite you?
We were told this was Little Italy.
Oh..Is this table taken..??
I think they got our orders mixed-up
Well, I did order a little dinner for two.
That’s the last time I order the everything pizza.
Why did you order Lilliputian? It’s worse than anchovies.
I asked for very little oregano, not very little Oregonians.
You distinctly ordered 'people only'. Not pepperoni.
We ordered take-out. I guess you ordered in.
Grub Hub brought us some company for dinner!
Yes, we’re the voices inside your head. NOW could we get a little privacy on our night off?
We didn’t order the extra large.
Can you, at least, take off your shoes?
Would you mind!? We're trying to have a private conversation here.
We weren't sure what to expect when we signed up to an authentic Italian Airbnb 'experience'
Nothing better than pizza with a couple of friends.
So, were you the guys who wrote "Drink me" on our wine glasses?
PLEASE!  We asked not o be disturbed.
Excuse us, this is a private pie.
You ordered the small singles topping pizza.
On the third wish she, unfortunately, said to the genie, "Gee, I could really get down on some pizza."
You are what you eat.
You know the pizza's good when it has a small clientele.
PLEASE CLOSE THE BOX.  WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN!​
I thought I ordered the large.
How about three slices for each of you, and one for each of us?
You ordered a two-person pizza, right?
Yes, we also ordered 'family style' pizza."
I promise we'll leave in thirty minutes or less.
Exactly what did you think these things are for?
Well. then what did you think these things were for?
I ordered Italian sweet pepper topping, not sweet Italian people on top.
Mind closing the lid, it's our date night.
Can you believe people just throw these away?
Yes, this is the "Little Italy" special. What were you expecting?
I say this is taking a small intimate pizza place too far
Next time, no pineapple.
Is a little privacy too much to ask for?
The maître d' said we could sit anywhere.
Honey, the Lyft drivers are here
We're the small intimate dining experience you ordered.
Honey, say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Topper.
Next time we’d like a little more pie and a little less fee fo fum
We wanted to dine in, but they only have delivery.
Well, the wine bottle was labeled “Drink Me”...
I’ll try the tiramisu and he’ll have the gelato.  Thank you.
Yeah, we're the Anchovie's--what's it to you?
I'm starting to regret eating the mushrooms off this pie.
Are one of you finally going to take our order?
If you don't mind, this pizza's kinda personal.
They are taking meat lovers a bit too far
Normally, we clean up and leave when the guy rings the doorbell, but it's our twenty-fifth anniversary.
I know you asked for vegan but we're actually pescatarian."
It’s little plastic tables all the way down!
The Wi-Fi in here really sucks.
Do you mind? We were having a moment.
We took really, really, tiny bites.
What are the specials tonight?
Hi! We’re Ted and Tina Topping
To be honest, it did say : Mini pizza for two...
Hello, we're the Pepperonis. Do you have any red wine?
May we see the dessert menu, please?
I did warn you that binge-watching old Twilight Zones was risky.
Can we have a little privacy here?
Can we get some service here.
Do you mind? We were just having a moment here!
So sorry...we asked for a Giant sized
I hope you don't have allergies.
If you could dim the lights this would be more romantic.
We were carrying our chairs and spotted this table and then it went dark.
Would you mind if I used the Little Girl's Room?
Please, a little privacy.
Could we have some privacy, please?
Sorry, but the moon hit our eyes
Everyone told us to try the pizza in New York...so here we are!
Why don’t WE ever go out?
Our pizza has arrived. It appears we're having guests for dinner.
Looks like when Tinkerbell isn't working for Disney she's just like us.
Sorry to impose, but do you have a restroom we can use?
Would you like to order us to go?
The Chair?  IKEA.  The table was already here.
It's a well balanced Chianti. Why do you ask?
Sorry...we ate all the mushrooms.
I'm Steve Topping, and this is my wife, Marla.
Mind if we join you? We're a little hungry.
Margret Bridleman, you have been served
We specifically asked for a table NOT near the kitchen!
Get over it.  Toppings mistakes happen.
That's the last time I do bottomless mojitos.
Ever heard of knocking?
When you ordered you said, "Surprise me!"
Yeah, we ate your pizza, but you can keep the nice little plastic table.
Hey, let me look at those coupons again.
It says right in our ad, “the taste of Little Italy in every pizza.”
I knew someday it would happen.
Hi, we're the Anchovies. I'm John and this is Mary.
I don't think we are in Kansas anymore
As long as you're here, could you get us another bottle of the Chardonnay?
Maybe you ordered take-out, but we're eating in.
Do you mind? This pizza table is reserved.
I'm guessing you didn't read the fine print when you ordered the dinner for two.
Are you taking Groupon tonight?
Oh my God..."
"Yeah, they forgot the fucking olives again.
The sign said, 'Please Seat Yourself.'
Hello, we are Mr. and Mrs. Pepperoni.
Looks like we're having the neighbors for dinner tonight!
We’re trying to be mindful of portion size.
Are you the Millers?   We are supposed to have dinner with the Millers!
Do you mind? This is an intimate conversation.
I thought we ordered pepperoni.
Is it closing time already
It's what you get when you order Li'l Caesars...pizza, pizza.
We are the Pepperoni's
It's tough getting a table in Manhattan!
I'm afraid we ate all the anchovies.
That’s the last time I call Little Caesars
One minute we were playing "Wheel of Fortune" and the next minute we're here.
Sorry, we already reserved this table.
Sorry, honey. When they said every kind of meat I didn't think it would be this... awkward.
Is it hard to think outside the box?
We said “to go” not “two to go.”
They said you ordered a couple of toppings.
I told you it was a small restaurant.
Way to ruin the mood, fellas.
NYC apartments are getting smaller and smaller
Well, you asked for the meat lovers pie, and we're the meat lovers!
Do you mind? It's personal.
Do you know how hard it is to get a decent table here?
Did you check inside the box before you paid for it?
I really hope you're vegans.
We asked for a table in the 'Twilight Zone' section.
Did you tip the delivery boy?
While racing to beat the 30 minute deadline we accidentally tore the space-time continuum.
Look, dumbass, I’m tired and I have a very thin crust. Just bring us some menus!
Uh Oh, I think they forgot to unzip the compressed file from the online order before they delivered it.
You wouldn't happen to have an appropriately-sized bottle of wine?
Just be thankful you didn't order pad thai.
You ordered with an extra couple toppings?
Jack and Carol Pepperoni, and you?
Not to worry, we're Italian.
They forgot the anchovies, again!
Waiter. We'll take the Chianti while we're waiting for our pizza.
Last thing we remember was goin' to 'Aladdin'--and later talkin' about downsizing over takeout.
do you mind? we are kind of in the middle of something
So you mind! We waited an hour for this table.
I ordered margarita with pepperoni not margarita with peopleonit
We’re time travelers from when the earth was believed to be flatbread.”
You're taller than the first waiter we had. So where's our order?
We're the two-for-one special.
Ummmm... Are they edible?
They forgot to add olives again
I'm sorry, we've been waiting longer than you.
I'll have the Petit Syrah
We combined Uber and Uber eats."
Could we move please? This table feels sort of boxed in.
We ordered Pizza Surprise. Did you order it, too?
May I ask a small favor?
It happens when we're exposed to heat.
Don't mind us. We're just here to prevent the box top from smashing into the pizza.  Go ahead, dig in!
You ordered a cheesy couple?
This is your first order from Cracker Jack Pizza isn't it ?
If you care to join us, we can change to a large.
What up, home slice?
First the place isn’t gluten free, now this?
I always wondered what those little things were for...
I mean, I guess we could share.
I'm not so sure about this sharing economy thing anymore
Could we have a little wine
Despite being left out of the economy, we little people have to eat too.
I knew that little piece of plastic was actually a dining table, you just have to open the pizza carton quickly enough...
I wondered why he said 'Sardinians'...
The kids were right, it is a table!
Second thoughts about the Meat Lovers Special, eh?
Yes, you've opened the pizza dimension. It's a dimension not of sight and sound, but one of bizarre toppings.
It's about time! Can you Instagram this moment for us, please?
¨I`ll have a vodka tonic hold the ice and make it quick we´ve only got the baby sitter till 11¨
Do you mind? You're really killing the ambience.
Chuck and Emily Best, here. We understand you've tried all the rest.
A big pizza pie, that's amore.
We're celebrating a small promotion.
Did you order a few toppings or a couple of toppings?
This tiny house thing has gotten WAY out of hand!
You requested a slice-of-life dining experience.
And you thought it was just to hold up the box top.
Yeah... Well... we were shut in a box, zipped up in a bag, and thrown in the back of van so we will be taking our time to finish.  And yes we ate your cheesy bread”.
Well, you did order shrimp on your pizza.
That’s not  right…… We ordered the vegetarian.
You didn't think our table was used only as a pizza saver?
Those transporter settings are whacky again Scotty!
Did you order two small ones?
Its been 30 minutes since we’ve seen anyone; some more wine please?
Use spellcheck next time!  This is a piazza!
It's okay, we're Italian.
You ordered The Fractal?
Hi, we’re the Pepperonis! And you must be the party at 412 East 53rd.
What company did you call, again?
We are the shadows of things that have been, ghosts of date nights past.
What was in the cannibis?
I could ask you the same thing
You ordered the party pizza?
The service here is awful.
If you see the waiter, we're still waiting for our breadsticks too.
Sweetie, Look up...
You ordered a large with everything, right'?
Could you shut the lid, I'm about to propose!
Jim, I told you to order a couple of pizzas, not a couple pizza.
They ate all the sausage.
Can I get another drop of the house Cabernet
We knew the reduction sauce sounded weird, but at least the table doesn't wobble.
Not what I meant by “plain.”
She's Pepper and I'm Ron. Now if you don't mind, we are in the middle of something here
Honey, I thought we ordered pepperoni...
Honey the look on their faces is priceless, this is definitely the ultimate food experience!
Who you callin' extra large?
We got it first.
Are we dining in or eating out?
I ordered a large. Not a personal.
Ahem, this was supposed to be a personal pan pizza!
Honey, I thought we were going to try mushrooms for a change.
Oh! You asked for a little salami, not a little sommelier on your pizza. Sorry about that
I don't know why you look surprised, we ordered out.
I'm sorry but we made a reservation ages ago.
How did you hear about this place?
They're dining in.
I was certain we ordered veggie.
And topping of the day to you, too.
Which one of you is our sommelier?
I know, it was $2.50 extra.
Next time, honey, let's think of date ideas outside the box.
Oh c'mon! Do you know how long it took to find chairs to match these free tables?
I told you we should've stayed in!
It’s their date night special.
One couple's take out is another couple's dining in.
I ordered from that new “Eat-In Pizza” in joint.
What? You've never heard of Lillipizza?
Do you mind?  This is a party for two.
Well, I don't think that combining anchovies and pineapple is right, either.
Pizz-off
Is there NO privacy!!
I asked for extra mini peppers, not Mr. & Mrs. Minipepper.
It seems like the portions just keep getting smaller.
It's not Dijiorno and it wasn't meant to be delivered to you!
You asked for meat lovers.
Hi, we’re Bob and Nancy Pepperoni – I’m guessing we’re not exactly what you had in mind.
Dominoes meets the twilight zone
Perhaps ‘cardamom and date’ was an overventuresome choice of topping.
Do you mind?  We're having a private conversation.
Il menu ha detto sorpresa italiana per due. Allora eccoci qua. 
Buon appetito.
And, in spite of all that, neither of us spilled a drop.
We'll take the cheque
We've finished.  Would you please bring the check?
We specifically requested a table al fresco.
I think they mixed up our orders.
Like you can’t afford to skip a meal.
Well, you did order from Little Italy.
They were out of anchovies.
Hey! We're in the middle of something here!
It was the only table available.
You don't know pizza until you've squished it beneath your toes.
All right, we’re part of the food chain - but could we have an appetizer before we become one?
You ruined the moment!
Hey!  I'm trying to propose here!  Do you mind?
He forgot our anniversary again. This is the only table we could get.
I didn’t think Jack would still be in the box.
We know... this tiny house stuff has gone too far
Excuse me, but can we get some pizza quiet?
Please set the lid down GENTLY!
Who orders dates on a pizza?
care to join us for a slice?
So much for the private table.
We wiped our shoes!
Another bottle of your house wine please...to go
Close the lid, she just cut the cheese
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna post one heck of a Yelp review.
We were expecting the sommelier.
Mr. and Mrs. Anchovy?
The Airbnb listing specifically said, 'Don't open the pizza box.'
Can we sit at the minibar instead?
How about waiting until I give her the engagement ring?
Do you mind? We're having a moment here.
We, too, were disappointed they forgot the pizza.
Congratulations! You're the one millionth customer.
Surprise!  It’s pizza for two in an intimate setting.
The hostess told us the table was available until 8:00pm.
You did order the surprise topping!
I hope this isn't an expiration date
I guess one couple’s piazza is another couple’s pizza.
A little privacy would be nice.
Just to remind you about portion control.
The pizza was great. Let us finish our wine.
You ordered a pizza with everything on it. 
I’m Harry Everything and this my wife Lois.
Mushrooms on pizza warp one's perspective.
I see Sal's has really gotten clever with their gourmet toppings.
You ordered the "Couples Special."
I'm Mozzarella and this is my wife Olive.
It’s pepperoni all the way down.
You ordered a vegetarian pizza: we're vegetarians.
We qualify as everything.
We are celebrating not being in a calzone.
Technically we're a topping, why?
Didn't I say 'no toppings'"
Trust me. We are equally confused.
I'm Pepperoni. She's Extra Cheese.
These Airbnbs are getting weirder and weirder
Hey, close the lid! You are ruining the ambiance.
Finally! I'd like to speak to the manager; we had to eat the carpet or we would have starved!
Hey, it's New York.
So that's what it's for.
I distinctly said we want a table on the piazza.
Alternate universe?
You took more than thirty minutes, so our dinner is free.
Do you mind? We're still waiting for our appetizers.
Can we see a dessert menu?
Oh, you wanted a small, MEAT lovers.
You ordered the ‘shroom topping, right?
You wouldn't have a few drops of Chianti?"
Well, at the time we thought "Downsizing" was unrealistic.
We just can't stay away from these little plastic tables.
Did you order a Lilliput topping?
So we finally find some matching chairs, and now this happens ...”
Just cut them a bitty slice, how much can they eat?
Hi. Here's your pizza from Lilliputian's on 8th.
The floor is sticky.
We”ll take it. What’s the rent?
They forgot the cheese.
Oh, thank God. Would you be a mate and top me off. I am having the Merlot.
Oh good, they did not forget the anchovies.
Miniaturize yourselves and join us.
It's time for the pizza de resistance.
Please put the ceiling back!
We asked for home delivery.
I think you two really ought to consider something other than pizza for dinner tonight.
Could you repeat today's specials?
Take another little pizza my heart now baby" . .
It’s not delivery, it’s Dine-In.
Oops!
It's a little Italian restaurant in every box.
You ruined the lighting
I can’t believe they seated us by the kitchen.
Well this tops everything!
The delivery driver got it wrong again!
I wonder what goes on when the lid is closed.
They ran out of room in the lasagna so they moved our table here
I hope your floor is cleaner than ours.
Did you folks order the small piazza?
As your little voice, I'm asking you, for once, to lay off the pizza.
Last time I let you pick the toppings.
Honey, did we order Betty and Steve in a deep dish or on thin crust?
They said we can have the table until 7:00.
This new place really puts the "meta" in Mediterranean style.
To be honest, we were expecting something a little fancier and definitely more private.
Don't you just love the adventure of a progressive dinner?
You know, pal, there's a big difference between ordering a couple Italian seasonings or a couple seasoned Italians!"
We took a wrong turn in Little Italy.
Yours is in the oven....
At least there isn't pineapple on it.
Yes, we’re the Pepperonis. What’s your point?
It' a a puppetroni pizza.
Yeah, well, you can’t be as unhappy as we are about this.
Do you have any hot sauce?
C’mon, you gotta start thinking outside of the box.
Hurry up and order another pizza, we're starving.
Which part of  "immersive dining experience" don't you understand?
You need a lot of dough to dine here.
Do you how hard it is to book a table this size?
It's not delivery, it's a reminder of your stale marriage.
Happy birthday dear Gulliver... happy birthday to you!
Sorry.  We'd asked  for a little vino on the piazza.
We're here to provide ambiance
It definitely beats living in a matchbox.
Does this look like a free table to you?
The order said, dinner for two
Are you sure this is vegan?
Oh man, they forgot the garlic butter!
Maybe we shouldn't have ordered the Fantastic Voyage pizza.
We’re the upper crust topping
There’s always a catch when they say zero calories.
You guys get out more than we do.
We can’t always be sitting on top of wedding cakes.
We can't tell if it's an eye or a duck's head either, but it's one creepy pizza box lid.
Hey!
We're talkin' here!
We're talkin' here!
'It was the only way we could get you to visit us.'
Looks like they mixed up our Uber Eats order.
Ugh, I specifically said vegetarian.
Get the feeling there is a whole world out there we know nothing about?
It's the Omnivore's Dilemma, extra mushrooms.
Looks like we were delivered to the wrong address
It's a Chateau Petrus 2015 Bordeaux. You did order the special topping?
Do you mind? We're waiting for our toppings.
Looks like it needs a bit longer in the oven.
Whew, thanks for opening the box! It was as hot as an oven in here!
Were you raised in a barn?
You ordered the small special. What were you expecting?
You ordered the small.
I hope they didn't order the meat lovers special.
We are here to personalize your pizza.
I didn’t order two toppings!
That's Amore
All I'm going to say is that they shouldn't have built the nuclear power plant and pizza table factory next to each other.
You're not our waiter!!
Why do people say that they just want a little Peppe or Ronnie, then act surprised when we get here?
We bought the immersive experience.
Well, I see we’ve both gotten on with our lives, Lloyd.
Look, we don't like this any more than you do.
Can we please see the dessert menu?
-So...
 are we the ones in a Black Mirror episode or they are?
It's mother's day and seating was limited.
We’re the Anchovie’s. It’s a pleasure to meet you.
We brought pizza from that little Italian joint.
Thank you. We were hoping to dine al fresco.
Not as weird as you ordering pineapple on your pizza.
Care to join?
You ordered the Family Style Pizza, didn't you?
Could you wait five minutes? I'm trying to propose here!
You ordered the 'Escape From New York'?
These are not the toppings we ordered
Do you have anything to remove grease spots?
Do you mind? We waited 3 months for this reservation
We ate the whole thing.
We'd appreciate a little privacy.
Well hello, you must be Pat.
looks like their is a small couple of problems with our pizza
I ordered pepperoni, not “people only”!
Garcon, another bottle please.
Where is our food? The service here is terrible!"
you're letting the heat out, asshole!
It was actually kind of romantic with that sliver of light reflecting off the surface of the cheese.
Did we take mushrooms or ask for mushrooms?
Are you the waiter? We have a tall order for you.
You said, 'with everything.'
I know this seems a little cheesy for a first date
Well I'm not sharing!
Did your order  a  couple of  mini pizzas--or a mini couple?
Still better than pineapple.
This is a personal pan pizza.
We were just having a slice and watching Ant-Man and boom, here we are.
They forgot the pepperoni!
You stay in your universe, we'll stay in ours!
The pizza company shorted us as well!
We just purchased a tiny house!
So put on some Allman Brothers and we'll guide you through this Denver mushroom pizza.
Do you mind?  We asked for their most private table!
We applaud your choice of toppings.
Trust me, we're delicious.
So that's what the thing in the pizza box is for!
It's cheesy but it can be so comforting to think inside the box.
Don't laugh-you haven't lived until you've experienced Little italy.
When we ordered the special, I had a different take on what a meal for two would be.
Is that what we ordered, pizza for two?
This was the only table to be had.
Thanks for having us over, whats for dinner?
It's our anniversary and you know how hard it is to get a table in this city.
Well you did order a plain white pizza
Excuse me, I've had this reservation booked for a month! It's our anniversary for crying out loud! Would you please leave us alone to enjoy this meal? I mean seriously the one time we get a sitter and decide to make a night of it and you come along?!
You're letting all the heat out.
They said it was either this or the kid's section
Nice neckbeard, chubbo.
I think they’re trying to tell us something
See, Reggie, this is why you always read the fine print of the Pizza Palace promotional coupon.
Looks like they added a couple toppings.
We ordered the 'miniature'...And you?
Best we could do on as tiny budget.  Now close the lid, please
I dunno, it seems kind of "meta"...
It's nice, actually. But you need to put baggies over your shoes.
You knew it was personal when you ordered it.
Meta, schmeta. You’re letting the heat out.
Who invited them to dinner?
We decided it was time to downsize.
Look Frank, even our meal is having a romantic meal.
Actually she’s Canadian. I’m the Hawaiian.
Whose idea was it to add those magic mushrooms, anyway?
Hi! We're Lilapizzans
A mixed race couple? You don't see that every day!
We don't recommend this place.. the floor is cheesy.
Getting inside the box was easy; finding a waiter is another story altogether”
Peopleroni?
Do you mind cutting us off a little piece?
I didn’t order the family meal!
Good thing we ordered an extra large.
What's wrong, too cheesy?
IKEA Spring Sale. The carpet is Italian, supposedly.
It´s Jonathan Swift's pizza recipe.
Did we order the pizza..or did the pizza order us?
Are you the manager? I have a complaint about the carpet.
So who told you about this great little Italian place?
Do you mind?  It took us weeks to get this 
reservation, and they just barely squeezed us in.
Ask them if they're non-GMO.
Go to Recursion Pizza" she said- "it'll be great" she said..
What?! You've never seen one-legged people at a three-legged table?
Well, I never thought of that thing as a little table.
I said "This is my favorite little Italian place."
Hey, we made reservations for this pop-up months ago.
Are you two veggie-lovers?
I ordered a family pizza, not a family
Would you please put our tiny house roof back.
Must be authentic Italian.
Don't eat anything that comes in a box.
You ordered the party for two special ?
The crust is just too thick for us.
It seemed cozier than the Airbnb hat box on 74th and Park.
It's actually a pretty good price for a Brooklyn studio!
You seem to have taken our table....
Grub Hub?
Let’s just say he won’t be slicing pizzas again anytime soon.
Good pizza - can we get two more glasses of wine?
They call it an ‘immersive dining experience.’
I ordered cheese lovers delight not cheese lovers fight
Well.. What did you think Family Style meant?
Do you deliver? We need a ride home.
And you’re in a pizza, too!
We'd love to have you join us.
Two more glasses of Chianti please.
We’d like a bottle of your best Chianti, please.
That little plastic thingy looked like a table to us!
We’d like also a small pie to go, please.
I'm going to have to ask you to keep that closed. This table gets a really bad draft.
Sorry, my parents can impose sometimes.
Wait, did you order the 'Meat Lovers' or the 'Meta Lovers'?
Hey! Gawkers! We're having desert, over here!
We decided to eat in
You ordered the personal pizza again?
We're still not ready to order.
So you're telling me you did not order Pepe and Ronnie?
I don't think this is what "Pizza-gate" was referring to.
Look, lady, you should have asked these questions _before_ you ordered the special.
Can we move to a table near the lid?
All she said was,"I wish there was a quicker way to downsize."
Stare much?
Ugh, I made this reservation months ago.
You know how hard it is to get a table at Grimaldi's.
Do you mind? We're just looking for a little ambience here.
I thought you ordered a Hawaiian.
Don't order the mushroom pizza.
Where I come from, it's rude to stare.
They delivered the wrong one --this is not vegetarian.
We're here in Little Italy.
Did you invite Harriet and George?
Just go away; this is OUR hut.
I think we'll need a to go box.
“Do you mind? I was about to get lucky.”
I told you the food delivery app was a little buggy.
When I ordered a personal size, I didn't mean my in-laws.
Can I speak to a manager?
This is a personal pie.
Lab-to-table.
Our chihuahua's in the tiramisu.
Oh, hi. We’re the Pepperonis, Guido and Maria from Little Italy on East 48th.
I told you the Chef's Surprise menu was a bit wonky for a Monday night.
THIS is the family-sized pizza?
Yeah, not exactly our idea of "pizza delivery" either.
I think it is much more hygienic to use the 3-legged plastic wheel to keep the pizza from sticking to the box.
So much for the giant opening we were promised.
No,No! don't touch them.  I think they are Russian dolls.
We asked for a table away from the rest room.
Is this someone's idea of a joke?
I don't think this is what I meant by little Italy
We’re here to talk about wise food choices.
Well, what did you think a Liliputian pizza was?
This is the new two for one promotion.
I'm Bianco and she's Margherita
Thanks. It was getting stuffy in here.
When I ordered the “cocktail party” pizza, I thought we’d be getting double cheese with shrimp and olives.
Wait til you see what happens next time you order Chinese food.
Indeed, you ordered a small Margarita; may I introduce you to a small Margarita.
Please let us eat in peace...close the lid and we'll be done in a half hour.
Don’t you think a few laps up and down the beanstalk would be better than a large pepperoni?
They must have put the wrong type of mushrooms in your pizza!
You ordered Neopolitan. We're the Neopolitans.
We'll take the check now, please.
I'd say the date night special is as advertised.
They took my vegetarian pizza order way too literally.
We're your pop-up Happy Birthday card; music to follow!
We paid extra to eat in the cook's kitchen, to be up close and personal with her creations!
You ordered a small ... what did you expect?
Do you mind? I was just about to propose.
Well you shouldn't have ordered a Piazza then ...
How much did you tip the delivery guy?
Magic Mushroom Pizza!
Would you mind closing the lid, I think he was just about to pop the question?
Honestly, it was supposed to be family sized
You should have ordered Deep Dish!
She wanted to be taken out to eat.
We're dining al fredo
Hey, we're just as surprised as you are!
Didn't you order a piazza?
Don’t worry, we took our shoes off before walking to our table.
You wouldn't have a coupla microliters of Chianti laying around, wouldja?
It’s all in the delivery!
They said it was a family pie but this is ridiculous.
No need to stare, we've just downsized.
Hi, we're your new neighbors and we thought we'd share a large pizza with you.
What?  You never heard of wine in a box?
I thought you said you wanted everything on it?
I'll have another glass of the Cabernet.
Hey. Wait a minute... These people aren't Sicilian!
Do you mind leaving the light on when you leave?
It's okay, we're not wearing shoes!
This is how everyone can leave a smaller footprint.
Taking dining in to whole new level I see
We love the new retractable roof!
we had a rough ride here now would you let us eat in peace
I asked for family size, but??
I thought piccole persone just meant a small pizza.
Yep, they're real cute, but where's the damn pie?
...and we're reducing our carbon footprint.  You?
Can we get this to go?
We’ll have a petite filet and a few drops of  Merlot !
Schrödinger's Date
For the third time John, I don’t like people on my pizza.
So this is the special pizza dinner for two!
Call my wife a meat-lover again and you'll be the one getting delivered in a box!
Ever see that Matt Damon movie?
Sorry, we ate the anchovies.
That's much better, thanks, though we're still not ready to order.
Could we get some pepperoni? This thing's a little wobbly.
Are you sorry you said, ‘Not everything is a Kafka metaphor’?
I thought the vegan supreme would be topped with more vegans.
Please close the lid, you're letting all the heat out.
About time! We've finished all the pizza, our glasses are empty and we're waiting for the panacotta. What's taking so long?
Great.They gave us Peopleroni, again.
What can I tell you - you ordered the Secret Surprise Topping of the Month.
I told you to order a large!
I ordered pepperoini.
They ate all the mushrooms!
Well, there's something you don't see every day!
Did you order artichoke hearts or old college sweethearts?
Sorry, it was the only free table in the pizza place.
Does people sound like pepperoni to you?
Apologies for the inconvenience, but there's no seating available until 9:45.
Sorry, but we ate all the magic mushrooms en route.”
Yes, it's small, but the rent is unbeatable.
Yes, our feet are in the sauce. And?
The things we do to cheat!
We paid extra for the chef's table, so let's see some knife skills!
This is people-roni, I ordered pepperoni!
I liked it better with the lights off, thank you.
John is that you?! It's a small world
Surprise!
Excuse me, we’re on lunch.
And now you know what these plastic inserts are for!
Hi.  We’re Diane & Jack . . . Pepperoni.
Mind turning on Game of Thrones?
This is not what I ordered.
I’ll take a slice without any life, please.
You ordered a meal for two, didn't you?
Yes, please. Another drop of wine would be lovely.
This is not quite what I expected on my first date.”
The shrinking middle class.
You need to clean the floor in this place. It's greasy.
I said I'd have the special pizza FOR two, not WITH two.
Couldn't help but notice you didn't tip the driver.
To be honest, we're not crazy about being seated near the kitchen.
Now you've done it. You shouldn't have ordered from Pandora's Pizzeria.
Hi, we're the Peppers.  I'm Red and this is Green.
You ordered the small party box with two shrimp
Hey buddy could you put a lid on it?
Would you like to join us for a little pizza?
These are people; I said, "with extra people."
Nice to meet you. We're the Caesars.
But I am Olive and this is my husband Pepe
Put a lid on it and give us some privacy will you?!”
Looks like our little slice of heaven is about to be devoured
Well yes,we are meat lovers.  Why do you ask?
Did you order a pizza for or with two people?
It's our first date and we wanted something with a really intimate atmosphere.
It’s everything we wanted only smaller.
You should see the things we've done with chopsticks.
No two toppings could more perfectly complement each other.
Can we get a table a little farther from the kitchen ?
Little Italy keeps getting smaller.
Yea, but I still feel under dressed.
This is just a reminder of how your romantic Italian dinner is supposed to be.
You ordered the date night pepperoni special — right ?
How are those edibles working out?
At least they've not anchovies.
You should have made a reservation!
For what it's worth, it's special for us.
We haven't had a date night in two years! What does it take to get some privacy around here?!
We ordered takeout.  Why do you ask?
They're a small pizzeria, but the portions are huge!
This was supposed to be half olive and half blind date.
Excuse me, but can you take our order? We've been waiting for 30 minutes or less
The menu said: Pizza for Two.
Is this 3804 Beanstalk Lane?
A Great Little Table, eh?
You asked fr a family style pizza and you got it.
My God!  These little people have eaten our whole pizza !!
Do you mind closing the lid? We paid extra for a secluded spot.
We're here to see the game.
Sorry we didn’t save you any.
We’re just stand-ins until the four and twenty blackbirds get here.
Honey, Did you order the Lilliputian pie?
Should I call Grubhub and ask for a do over?
Now this is a topping I’ve never seen before
Excuse me, but this is a private gathering.
Close the lid, we'll fold up.
Peter, I thought I asked for the veggie option!
Well, it’s your choice of course, but you should know that we’ve both eaten peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, wheat and soy within the last 24 hours.
Where did you order from?
These new craft pizza’s are getting weird.
I wondered who paid for the pizza.
We’re the Pepperoni’s. You got a problem with that?
You ordered the small family-style to go?
Can we get a refill?
Hey Gulliver, some privacy please!
I know, we asked for a large too.
What? You have never seen a nine slice pizza before?
I  should have asked what was in the small pizza...
Close the lid, you’re ruining date night!
We're on a date.  Do you mind?!
We were a little hungry"
Ugh, I hate peopleroni.
Any way you slice it, it's now a table for four.
A little privacy, I'm about to get laid!
You were expecting pineapple?
Could you pour some Chianti ?
The small pepperoni was enough for us but you might want to order the large.
You're surprised? I thought I was going out for an intimate dinner on the piazza!
Would get me a birthday candle and close the box?
This is not what I expected when we ordered the Meat Lover's Pizza.
Did you not order a vegan non-gluten double?
Would you knock before you enter!
'Thanks, it's a little hot in here.'
What’ya think was on a New Yorker pizza, lady?
We are minimizing.
Carl, I think the LSD is kicking in.
Honey, what type of mushrooms were on the other pie?
Would you mind giving us some pizza and quiet?
Hey, wouldya mind? You’re kinda spoiling the happy hour vibe.
This table’s reserved
I thought you were going to order the large?!
I swear I said “pepperoni.”
Does this mean we have to share?
Do you mind? We waited for over an hour for this box and would like a little privacy.
You did order "With everything."
This was cheaper than paying for a taxi to get here.
It's all Barbie's fault. It started with using toothpaste tops for cups and thimbles for trashcans....
We call them little tables for a reason.
Extra cheesey, right?
Told you we should've ordered from Pizza Hut and not Little Caesars.
Can we see the wine list, please?
Well, I’m Red Peppers and this is Anna Chovey...why?
But you ordered dinner for two...
I ordered a vegetarian pizza
Go ahead and box ours up to go.
We were told a quartet was playing tonight.
What did you expect when you ordered a "small" from Gulliver's Pizzeria?
This is the extra cheesy one.
Hello!!!  Like can't anybody have any privacy anymore?
I think we ordered the other combination.
Listen , bud, what did you expect when you ordered a date night pizza?
Did you order home-style?
We thought YOU were bringing the pizza!
WTF indeed.
Yeah, whatever. Are the cannoli fresh?
We were just going to have a glass of wine and play Dominoes.
Well this is awkward!  Ed, meet Dave, my little friend.
We ordered a small pizza but I think there's been a mistake.
So this is 'restaurant style'...
Don’t worry, the wine is red.
Thanks for the light but could you dim them a bit? We're on a date here.
We're Vito and Maria Pepperoni.
No one told me we were having guests for dinner
Are you members of the one percent?
2 square feet. But it’s only $1200 a month!
The reviews said ‘cheesy decor, generous portions.’ Right on both counts.
This isn't what I meant when I said 'personal pizza.'
This is wrong - I ordered figs, not dates
This IS the "Slice of  Life" pizza.
They left the pineapple off again.
Remember, Domino's promises to replace your pizza for free if something goes wrong with the one you ordered.
I'm Peter... and this is my wife, Paula Pepperoni.
No, there's not enough to share.
Honey, did you order Meat Lovers’ or Lovers’ Meet pizza?
No, we were supposed to be delivered to 108.
Since when did they provide chairs.
Join us?
You're upset?  I'm the one paying for a large.
We find pizza is a great way to meet new people.
Yes, obviously, this is a table — did you think I put here just to keep the our ceiling from touching the floor?!
We're ready to order, could you send our waiter over?
You obviously dialed the wrong number.
Do either of  you speak English?
We represent the 4 T company ... Tiny Topping Taste Testers.
When Uber Eats told me they were downsizing, I didn't think they meant this.
We got tired of dining alone, so we thought we'd try something different.
Join us? The pizza place was too noisy.
Don't look at us. You're the ones who ordered Round Table Pizza.
"We were even smaller, except we ate 
your order while we were waiting."
So your the one who ordered a pizza for a date?
And this here is Margherita
Thinking outside the box.
Yes, it's an interesting thought experiment, but can we stop now?
Welcome to Little Italy
That's us, Bill and Marie Anchovy.
We were hungry.
Don't worry--We are gluten free.
We decided to have dinner in Little Italy.
Maybe we should try Chinese.
You ordered one with everything on it?
Could we get a doggie bag?
We heard about you on Yelp.
The Tuesday Special is 'date night' this week.
Well, you did order the Chicago-style pizza
You just knew this was going to happen one day.
Excuse me, you're open until when?
Do you mind? We’re trying to have a personal pie.
"Always tip the delivery kid. Last warning."
I hate this new micro restaurant
It looks like the date night special, but we ordered a large.
It's the toughest table to get in town.
Do you have a table near a window?
I told you we should have left a better tip.
Their names better be Mushrooms & Pepperoni!
Hi we're your extra toppings, i'm Basil and this is Olive.
Jeff, we talked about enunciation. The pizza man can't tell when you say pepperoni instead of Maloney
We’re the Noyds.  Your pizza was delicious.
Well, their ad said, "Bring home a little Italian dinner".
Listen, friend, we're still on our aperatifs and things would go a lot more smoothly if you didn't keep looking over our shoulders. We'll be finished when we're finished, then it's all yours.
What did you expect - pepperoni?
Could we have a bit more wine?
For the seventeeth time, we don't want our glasses filled!
Can I help you?
Careful man, there’s a beverage here!
Excuse me, but WE reserved this table a week ago!
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
You wanted dates as a pizza topping?
We were hoping for a table that's a little less drafty.
Excuse me, this table is reserved.
Would you like to join us in a pizza?
I ordered pizza and dinner for two.
Wow. First time we've seen customers in a while; our five star review must have really helped business.
Can you shut that damn door!!
It is our anniversary, can we have another 20 minutes?
"If you're from the Health Department we're screwed."
We can't believe we ate the whole thing.
Honey, did you order Mozart + Ella pizza again?
Amazon really should've stayed out of the restaurant industry
At Lilliputino’s we aim to please...
Did they charge us extra?
Hi, we’re the lovers you wanted to meet.
It's reduce reuse and, then, recycle!
Do you mind! You're letting in a draft
They did say the deluxe pizza would be like fine dining.
Honestly John, if you wanted to introduce some excitement  into our  our sex life, couldn’t you just use the app?
Would you mind closing the lid, we're having a little pizza party!
excuse me, can't you see we're having dinner?!
I can't believe they found matching chairs.
Now that's what I call a slice of life.
All that's left is a slice of life.
Thanks for ordering a Small.  It was great!
We're into reducing and re-using.
Can you tell our server we're ready to order,please?
I wonder if they knew we were Gay?
So much for the mood lighting!
Excuse me, but this pizza is personal!
So did you have to pay extra for those toppings?
Would you please bring a candle, and then re-close the lid?
We're going to need a bigger pie.
What toppings did you order?
'"Topping. And you?'"
Give them a pizza your mind!
Can’t you see we are having a romantic dinner!
It's us
Rough times for wedding cake toppers.
I hope you have Parmesan.
We ordered take-in.
We'll have the linguine fra diavolo.
The ad said we would be transported to a little slice of heaven.
New York style.
And--yes, we're using the chili flakes packet later as a mattress.
The newest Sitcom, The anchovies
This is what the 'Big Brother  Pizza' looks like
We love the food, but the decor is a little cheesy.
We fucked on pretty much every part of this pizza. Bon fucking appetit.
Scram, this is my dream.
Sorry.  We couldn't finish our wine within the 30 minute delivery.
Where did the chairs come from?
Well, we did order an 'everything.'
Sorry.  The dollhouse is getting cold.
I thought it was weird when the menu said "people"roni pie.
Look, do you mind? We asked for a private table.
What did you expect? The tiny homes on Amazon were all sold out!
I think we pressed the wrong option on Grub hub.
But I wanted sausage and mushrooms."
We decided to downsize AND go upscale.
This table it too close to the kitchen."
We saved the pizza for you.
And that's why they call it Slice-o-Life Pizzeria.
Your Airbnb ad for "A Little Slice of Heaven" didn't really make this part clear.
We asked for a small shroom, not a small room!
It's not an ultimate deep-dish pizza until I tell you what Margaret and Harry have been up to recently.
Are you a humanitarian?
I thought you ordered the pepperoni?
This pizza is the world to me!!
You said the pizza ‘s ‘on us,’not the other way around!
I'm Pete and this is Patty.  We're the Pepperonis from next door.
This used to be such a nice little Italian place.
Hi, this is Martha, I’m Fred, we’re the Anchovy’s.
Get the door--it's our nosy neighbors again.
What the heck, this isn’t pepperoni!
It's not just the economic pie that's shrinking.
Art of the meal.
This might be our tipping point in the sharing economy.
Please tell me you didn't tip.
The mood was romantic until you opened the box.
You ordered the Pippa Ronny pizza, did you not?
So there is more to life than pizza. Point taken.
Hello, we're the Toppings. They were out of anchovies.
Sorry, but I’m a vegetarian...
Hey fellas, do you mind? I'm trying to treat my wife to a cheesy romantic evening.
Frank, did you order a party pizza again?
Sorry, we got here first.
Want to see strange? With a large pie, 
it's eight of us at a dining room table.
Sorry, we can't figure out the Uber app.
If this isn't your slice of Americana, then whose is it?
Mind if we move to a table farther away from the kitchen?
Miniature golf is more fun.
I'm sorry, this table is taken!
Drink up! Your Uber's here and Harry's hungry.
Weird, I know. How'd they get cheese in the crust?
First of all, thanks for being Beta testers for Yelp!
Glad I ordered a large.
Please save us a small slice.
What did you think "A  Little Italian Restaurant" meant?
Well, what did you think it was for?
That was the last time Pat ordered pizza from Little Italy.
Excuse me, we were promised a quiet corner.
I bet you they're here to chat about our cholesterol levels
Did you tell them a small vegan pizza or a small vegans pizza?
Could we see your dessert menu?
Funny, I never remember seeing anyone sitting at that little table before.
It's not so bad once the anchovies left.
You ordered the Lilliputian?
I hope you’re not hungry. We ate all your toppings.
We didn't know there was a cover charge.
Is that Big Sal?
Excuse us, this was supposed to be a personal pie.
Privacy puh-leese!
Next time, enunciate more clearly when you want a capocolla for your pizza topping.
You really killed the mood.
Did you order this from that new place in little Italy?
This merlot is not satisfactory.
They always forget the pepperoni...
Mario and Maria had to leave early but they rated the pizza a 5 and the Chianti a 3
Could you close the lid please?  We are trying to have a quiet candlelight dinner.
We needed to downsize and we just love Italy.
Do you mind! It's her birthday.
Our space ship landed at this pizzeria and then it all went downhill from there.
Close the door, the pizzas getting cold.
Thanks, it was getting a little warm in here.
I think it's only fair that you have the crust.
We're huge fans - in order to dine with the New York Giants, we had to think inside the box.
Excuse me, we're trying to have a little date here.
I thought you ordered Hawaiian, not angry Oompa Loompa.
Well, where in hell is our pizza ?
I think they misunderstood when you ordered "little portions", not
 Lillipuchuans.
Okay, how about fifty-fifty?
If you think we are a surprise, you first  better look  UP .
Hawaiian? No, we’re the ‘Two Can Dine for $6.99’.
I told you this table was too close to the kitchen!
Yes honey, I shrunk the kids, but frankly I didn't think that their newfound marginality would have brought them this close together.
You did order a piccolo of the same, no?
DARN IT ! I ORDERED THIS PIZZA WITHOUT ANY TOPPING.
Sorry, this seat is taken
Well, we did order the small.
We asked for a table in the corner!
Thought you said we had the whole place for ourselves
Yes, well frankly we're a little miffed too for not being considered a deluxe topping!
The crowds get bigger every time we come here.
Did they throw in a free drink?
At least we were able to be seated together.
Damn it, I distinctly said pepperoni, not Pepe and Ronnie!
YOUR LILIPUTS ARE HAPPY EVEN WHEN  LOCKED IN A BOX
Bet they'll be good with some hot peppers!
Could you just close the box? Our pizza is getting cold!
No, we didn't bring anchovies. Do we look like fishermen?
Surprise! No pizza here. We’re the Keto Diet police sent to save you from your  carb-addicted self.
Well, eat up, you stupid pig. This is what you wanted, isn't it? This is what you ordered.
Gulliver’s has the best pepperoni pizza in the city
Then again, have you considered that we might actually be some kid's playhouse?
Do you mind? We waited 30 minutes for this table.
Maybe if you kids didn't order out so much you could afford to buy a nice New York style apartment like ours.
This is why we don't like dining out.
Enjoy a slice of Little Italy!
We'd like to see your giant manager.
I told you mushrooms isn’t the same thing as ‘shrooms
Hey! We ordered a couple of giant pizzas, not a couple of giants!
Did you bring the house red I ordered?"
We hoped you wouldn't mind us dropping in.
sorry it's dinner for two
You're the one who ordered "chef's choice" as a topping!
‘Do you mind giving us a spin?’
This is the 'upper crust' pizza.  All the slices of pie are ours.
It's a small world after all!
Yup, this is the small cheese lovers pizza.
I dare not open the desert pudding
We are reviewing the latest boîte. What are YOU doing?
I specifically told the guy: Family Size.
We're drunk, we live next door to you, and we couldn't afford a cab. I guess that explains everything.
Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill?
That's not right. We ordered two guys.
There was a mix up at the chef's table
Gerald, get the good knives this time.
Oh, you want the vegetarian. We're vegan.
Can't a couple have pizza and a good red without someone raising the roof.
I told you, hon, that this would be a night to remember.
I thought the “flashback special” meant something with mushrooms on top?!?
Do you mind?  We are trying to celebrate Pi day in here.
We held up the lid the whole drive over and you begrudge us a little red wine?
Why is it necessary that we have to deal with the little people and Trump doesn't?
You DID order Round Table Pizza!
You ordered a small Margherita with Basil, right?
This must be one of those yuppy, artisan style pizza everyone's been talking about.
The ambiance was lousy, but the food was good.
Of course we took our shoes off. We're not animals.
Could you close the box--we're getting cold.
The line was around the block so they are creating in-box chat rooms while we wait. Won't you join us?
Can we see a wine list?
What do you mean -- we're your pizza topping?
Then why did you order shrimp topping?
It looks like ‘Giant’s Pizza’ wasn’t an amusing typo.
We were hoping to keep a lid on this.
So, this means our order is not coming?
If you don't mind, we're eating here.
That's right---a slice of life.
Which one of you is named Gulliver?
Do you mind?  We'd like a bit of privacy for our anniversary dinner!
A rare photograph of the Italian secret service.
Thanks for not spilling the wine on the way home
Is this from that little Italian place around the corner?
You said to surprise you.
That's why they call it a box lunch.
It's easy when you know the delivery guy.
You ordered the Two Topping Special, right?  Well - I’m Bob Topping, and this is my wife Nancy.
What? You asked for two small ones to go.
Don’t worry, we’re vegetarian.
I ordered the small family feast.
I’m Basil and she’s Margherita.  We’re today’s special.
This again?
Oh, you didn't order the small?
Well, maybe we think you're cheesy.
This is the special delivery."
We saved you a seat.
They must have thought you ordered a slice of life.
Sorry, my mistake. I thought Pizza Lilliput was just a small pizza
We want you “to go”...
Ugh, they forgot the sauce again!
i really miss the traditional pizza toppings
Sorry, our favorite little hole-in-the-wall was booked.
I'll be damned.  Alexa sent us Bill and Judy's hologram.
Could you please leave us alone?  You're ruining the mood.
It’s about time, we’ve been waiting more than thirty minutes for our refills.
You asked them to throw in a little extra spice?
Next time, DON'T order a personal pizza!
I ordered homestyle and that's what they sent.
This is a small!
Pull up and chair and join us.
And why did you think the table was here?
Did you read the 'with everything' part?
It's a small world!
'Extra Large' is just a matter of perspective.
We ordered the rose' and this is clearly a blush. What kind of establishment is this?
If you check your browsing history, you’ll know why we are here.”
Hey, do you mind closing the lid! We'd like a little ambiance.
THAT does NOT  look like anchovies
Do you mind, we are having a romantic dinner.
Look, I'm as surprised as you are - we asked the genii for an intimate dinner in PISA, not pizza....
Well now you know.
Hello, nice to meet you,We are the Anchovies!
Come see. They put meat lovers on our veggie
Ah. ‘’Meet’ lovers pizza. Got it.
Just when I thought this date was getting too cheesy.
Is the Pinot open?
So when did we adopt them?
this is the last time I use the pool function on uber eats
We're the Prosciuttos. Reservation at 7.
We'd both like another glass of wine, please.
They said there was no wait time, so we took it!
It's been 45 minutes since we ordered - any idea what may be taking so long with our extra-small deluxe?
This explains the missing pepperoni.
I asked for the Bistro size pizza for two and a bottle of red wine...The kid on the phone kept saying, 
“Got it. Got it.”
Sorry to drop in like this.What petit entrees are you seving this evening"
Was that YOUR pizza?
We said if you come over we’ll dine on pizza, didn’t we?
Shut the box!
If you're cheating on Keto, you might as well get all the toppings.
Yes, we Are wearing shoe covers.
'We'd invite you in, but I'm afraid there just isn't mush-room'.
Oc course we have reservations.
Had you hoped to reserve this table?
There must have been a mix-up about our jumbo order.
No, we’re the Kaplans. The Anchovies are on vacation.
Don’t worry, it’s free-range.
We were hoping to have a quiet dinner at the Wormhole Cafe.
Look, we've been waiting on a table for over an hour...
Tony and Angela
Pepperoni. Pleased to meet you
Yeah, and if I had a nickel for every middle-aged uptown couple who  said, 'What are these two tiny people doing drinking wine by the glass in the center of our pizza?', I'd be a wealthy tiny person.
Wow! They're sure thinking outside the box with this new dinner theater experience.
We decided to eat in tonight."
You're shocked? We made a reservation for a 'cosy boite', how do you think we feel?
I thought I ordered a pizza for two
We are just really thankful you didn’t order soup!
Can we have some privacy please!
Thanks for ordering from Really Little Caesars.
We ARE the couple of toppings.
What are you looking at?” You ordered the cheese with the surprise topping!
I ordered the "meat lovers"
Well, you did ask for a small pizza.
Yes, we found ourselves in this spot once before!   The pizza delivery guy is also the maitre d’ at the Italian eatery on 5th.
It's the new company promotion!
You never thought the plastic thing might be a Lilliputian table?
Good evening, and welcome to pizza theater in the round.
We forgot to say it:   No anchovies, please!
You must have noticed that it looks like a little table.
Skip the mushrooms.
You did order a 2 topping pizza, didn't you?
Close the lid, you're letting the heat out.
Mind if we join you?
What did you think it was for?
Do these mushrooms taste different to you?
My shoes are perfectly clean, thank you very much.
Could you bring a smidge of Parmesan?
I foolishly asked the genie if he would like a little cheese with that whine when I told him to get back in the bottle.
I think they want us to move out.
We refused to leave our table for "Gullivers Pizza"
We'd like to order another round.
At least they didn't skimp on the cheese this time!
We'll be finished in a few minutes.
The pizza place must have written down 'Lilliputians' instead of 'a little parmigiano.'
What type of pizza are you standing on?
This floor is disgusting.
Sorry, we had to eat the pizza. We've been in this damn box for a week or more.
Hey! Can we get a little privacy here?
Would you mind? We are in the middle of a date.
Did you order with or without Lilliputians?
Please, let us enjoy the moment.
I'm Basil and this is Rosemary - as per your order.
You were right. The personal pizza would have been big enough to share.
''You ordered extra cheese.''
I don’t know.  We ordered here and to go, and here we are!
Excuse us, but we got here first!
We're your serving suggestion.
Last thing we remember was the aliens asking us what we wanted to eat
This is a private conversation lady!
What do you have to do to eat your pizza in peace these days?
Small, thin crust.
This is the second time this place has given me diorama.
The vegan special now comes with dates.
Hey, you ordered extra toppings, didn’t you?
Just an eight of slice for me, please.
We recommend a good chianti.
Excuse me, we didn't know this pizza was taken.
You are what you eat special.
A little dinner, I see.
I never thought I'd see the day... a three-legged table. Astounding.
What? Did you not the meat lovers?
I ordered a single, vegetarian.
We'll have the tiramisu and coffee for dessert.
You checked extra toppings when you ordered this pizza. You give us a little wine and we give you light witty banter.
I said olive and pepper, not Olivia and Peter.
You're holding up OUR dinner!
You are welcome to join us for dinner, but you may want to take your shoes off first.
I know you see us as bugs but I assure you we are people.
I know people who have come out of the closet but you are the first couple who've come out of the box. Being unique is rewarding.
Well, we didn't order a plate to share either.
*thick New York accent*
"Ayyy how bout some privacy here!"
It’s intrusion on our privacy any way you slice it!
This is a ‘PRIVATE’ party fellas!
I’m Joey Pepperoni and this is my wife Marie.
Not what we meant by "carry out."
You think it's bad for you? They're making us eat off the floor!
Remember when date night led to more than acid reflux?
We just wanted to skip the dishes and have a quiet night at home!
May we have more wine with your pizza?
You never think outside the pizza box!
Close the lid, it's cold!
The "Extra Large" can feed a small group.
You're getting the full taste of Little Italy.
Well, the Yelp review did say this place has a large following.
We frequently pop up in unexpected locations
You ordered a Mediterranean didn’t you?
....hope you are not hungry.
A healthy marriage is more than just "standing on cakes".
Maybe CBD edibles shouldn't have been legalized?
How else did you expect to get a romantic dinner with delivery pizza?
This is the meat lovers pizza?
If you make a downsizing joke, I will poop on your pizza.
We wiped our feet.
We should have held the mushrooms.
We were hoping we could have some time to ourselves on the piazza!
Yeah well, maybe we are tiny and maybe we do live on a pizza in a box but at least we're not ugly.
Is this your dream,or ours?
We have our drinks, thanks, but where are the four and twenty blackbirds?
We ordered in not takeout.
Pizza? What Pizza?
Take out? We decided to eat in!
Your manboob is telling me you should pass on the pizza.
Oh, and I suppose you thought these tables were for, what, pizza delivery?
Bob Mankoff wouldn't have bought this.
Excuse me! Can't a couple have some privacy on their first anniversary?!
What cannibals order for delivery on a Friday night.
Honey, I thought you ordered a party of 3...
I DON'T THINK HE'S MY TYPE.
So this is what they call their “Date Night “ pizza?  Can’t wait to what else is on the menu!
This is not what I meant when I said I wanted a romantic evening for two.
They should be smaller and more of them to be considered a legit topping
Can we split the bill 8 ways?
Chicago pizza keeps getting worse.
Yes we went for the three wishes pizza too
Yelp promised a genuine Sicilian dining experience
This is more than we can eat.  Would you like some?
Well, it turns out the delivery guy isn't schizophrenic after all...
What'd ya think they were for?
I thought we ordered cheese only.
Welcome to the new social network!!
Hi, we are Pepe and Roni. Now why did you want us with your pizza?
They were out of non-white couples.
You ordered "vegetarians" not "vegetarian."
They said it feeds four.
I'm Blue, and this is my wife Gouda. We understand that you ordered extra cheese.
We're the Dominos.
Don't you dare put us in the microwave again!
One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.'
Jerry told me about this when he came here, we just have to tell them "what a lovely home!"
Hey, a little pie-vacy, here, please!
This blind date just got a bit weird...
Hey, they ate our pizza
We enjoy the admittedly cheesy ambience.
Don't worry, we don't eat much
Shocking, I know! But we had to downsize; we 99 percenters could no longer afford to live on a human scale.
Red wine with white pizza? Philistine Lilliputians!
Do you mind? Our pizza's getting cold.
We're the extra toppings.
WHAT?  NO OREGANO?!!!
You two better slow down with the extra larges.
Your pizza will be ready in 10 minutes.
What did you expect when you ordered authentic Italian’s takeout?
That’s not what I ordered
This isn't the personal pan pizza I wanted.
Do you mind?  This is a private dinner.
What the "f----"  are you two doing there ?
The family I always hungered for as a child.
That took longer than 30 minutes.
We're in the upper 1%, so we ate our share.
I distinctly ordered carry-out, not dine-in.
So sorry! But we only ate the anchovies.
And you thought you ordered the vegan pizza?
Funny. You called for take out and WE called for takeout.
Will you be our servers this evening?
Didn’t we ask for anchovies on our Lilliputian pizza
Sorry, this one is taken.
So, this is "family style?"
And we ARE what comes with the Suburban Couples' Deluxe pizza.
Sorry the order got mixed up. We are the couple who ordered the Lilliputian pizza.
No Mushrooms or Cheese, Come on?
Hey guys, even us little people demand a piece of the pie, too.
You ordered the small Canadian, so forget any refund.
You wanted extra crust, you got it bozo!
What do you have to do to be alone in this city?
Could we get the check?
Yes, we are small and we are meat lovers.
You think the pizzas big, wait until you see the wine!
With our student loan debt, this is the best Italian vacation we can afford.
Could you ask our waiter to please dim the lights?
I thought thinking outside the box would be thrilling! But no....
No, it's from 'Original' Nano Ray's
Stay out of our world, and we'll stay out of yours!
I love ordering pizza from Dave's he pays so much attention to the little things.
Wonder why they are looking at us strange, honey?
Mind if we borrow that chair?
It's not really about the crust when you order Lilliputian-style.
Don't give me that look. You could you have at least left us a slice.
It’s not what it looks like.
We are going to need another chair
We're just about done.
You didn't order a large meta?
Big appetites ... small dining table.
¨Can´t we just have some pizza and quiet?
I see you ordered the family size.”
Ellie Albertson, Westfield, N.J
Got any parmesan?
"I think of my ex-wife and her new husband and the carb craving disappears ."
It was this or pineapple.
These little tables are so rarely used, we decided to 'order-in' with delivery by Door-Dash.
It's true what they say, they really are getting smaller.
Mind closing the lid? Your other roommate is letting us sublet this space for $900 a month.
What's for dessert?
Careful, gentlemen -- the peyote pizza is particularly potent tonite.
Pull up another chair and join us!
Hey, this is a blind date.
We were ready to order half an hour ago!
And can you wrap the extra slices to go
Least there's no anchovies
Juice fasting is stupid--wake up and eat.
Hi, we're Pepper and Ronny Topping.
Pop--Up-- Pizza for 2 - Please .
Honey, I think we interupted something...
You ordered an all dressed up pizza?
If we had wanted to eat al fresco, we would have said so.
I guess it serves two.
We thought this would be the ultimate getaway.
Sorry...they delivered to the wrong address.
Well, you did say you wanted everything on it.
Carl this isn't vegan.
Really? You ordered the unhappy couple pizza?
The only thing that tops a pizza is small talk with a little wine.
We’re your special topping.
We ordered a party of four! This place never gets our order right!
It is Jonathan Swift pizza, after all.
Promise we won't eat much!
WE were promised our dinner would be served when the lights came on.
Not MY idea of  "everything"
they forgot the anchovies.
Don't worry.  We wiped our shoes off first.
It’s not what we thought “to go” meant, either.
No we are not anchovies.
 Put your glasses on.
Talk about small portions
Do you have anything to eat? I’m sick of pizza.
They offered us first available seating
Looks like we got additional toppings for free!
You can always scrape us off your “everything” pizza, along with the broccoli.
Did you order the small Piazza AGAIN ?
Are you vegan?
That's a real slice of life.
Chef Paolo said to reallyenjoy his pizza we needed to BE the topping.
Oh look dear, another relativity nerd who doesn’t understand quantum life
I guess they called our bluff on dining for four.
Seems I mixed up ordering an Uber with Uber Eats.
Seriously?!  They forgot the dipping sauces for the crust again!
The daily special, tomorrow is pepperoni.
Well, what were you going to do with it?
For the last time, our names are Clark and Tina Anchovy. Now can we finish our meal in peace?!
You just wrecked the ambience.
We thought the pizza saver might save our marriage, too.
No, it's not a cheesy first date!
I can't believe you guys ordered a pizza wearing those sweaters.
Double date?
I think it’s time to change the batteries in your hearing aids.  I said 2- mini Pizzas not 2-mini people!
I guess they forgot to put the meat lovers on the side.
They never listen ... I said "half couple on 1st date" AND "half bitter divorcee."
This is the last time we order from Gulliver's to go.
I specifically asked for a table away from the kitchen.
I thought you said they were out of white pizza
We thought you wouldn't mind sharing
Hey, we're eating here
Honey, you did say anything but anchovies.
Could you fix our table? It's a little wobbly!
Yes we saved the crust for you.
I chose the couple dining toppings!
We asked if they could serve us take out, and 'viola' here we are.
You think we should offer them dessert
I thought we ordered we ordered anchovies.
You forgot to order the olives again.
Seriously? If you weren't enjoying yourself you could've just said so.
Gentrification is truly out of control these days.
See what happens when you neglect your parents?
Next time, we need to order fewer mushrooms.
We were told there would not be a cover charge.
Do you mind? We're on a date.
A thimbleful of red wine would be great.
We'll take it to go.
You asked for a little aged Italian on your pizza, right?
Hey! We're trying to have a little dinner here!
We assure you that we are, indeed, meat lovers.
Well, you ordered shrimp, didn't you?
What? So you're ok with pineapple on here but not Susan and Jeffrey Holloway?
You ordered a pie with the Works.  We’re Albert and Maggie Works.
Take as many slices as you want, she already has half of it
We were having an intimate bistro moment - but that wouldn't mean much to you, would it?
Help us, Obese-one; you're our only hope.
"I wanted pepperoni, not people-roni"
A Lilliputian surprise.
The Airbnb listing called it a "hut" but the reviews were good
Yeah, I dunno. I said I wanted to eat her box, there was a whooshing noise, glitter and sparkles, and here we are. A genie with a sense of humor, I guess.
Small plates? I thought you said small dates!
Could you place us on a table further from the kitchen?
I'm a meat lover and my wife's a vegetarian, but somehow it works.
I think we got delivered to the wrong house.
You asked for "round table"? What did you expect?
We were sitting here having a drink when suddenly there was giant flash of light, and...well, here we are. Is this the Twilight Zone?
Did you order this topping?
We ordered our pizza 45 minutes ago!
Hey big fella,don’t act so shocked.It’s  Lisa and Don Pepperoni.
We didn't order two schlubby homebodies on our date night either.
Tony's "magic bean special" wasn't kidding!
We accidentally clicked both the dine-in AND take out option on the website.
We are just waiting on dessert.
This is what you get when you order a personal pizza from Little Italy!
Family size includes a Mom and Dad
Somebody said you were having a party?
I thought we ordered a large.
Uuummmm.... we are still waiting for our breadsticks...
“Sorry. Our hors d’oeuvres were taking forever, so we ate the toppings.”
Can’t we get a little privacy?
Did they get your order wrong again?
Well, at least they're not Hawaiian.
Two narcissists order takeout.
Wow, this really is extra cheesy.
That’s the last time we order from A Little Slice of Life
It’s the only way to get it while it’s hot.
We'd like another table without as much people traffic.
Excuse me, we're still waiting on our bread twigs
They weren’t kidding when they said it “feeds 4”
So where is our pizza then?
Do we look like we could eat all those toppings?
Privacy Please!
We've been waiting 33 minutes for service. I trust our order will be free.
It's faster than Uber...
Gosh.. Tables are really hard to come by at this restaurant..

..That's right! A little privacy please and if you could dim the lights again..
You'll get your food when we get ours!
Well don’t just stand there, serve the pizza!
Well, we used to do wedding cakes about once a week, but after that 8-tier incident we moved on to pizzas.
Our shoes are squeaky  clean and we only need a few minutes to finish our drinks.
I could have sworn I ordered vegetarian.
Ugh...I hate ‘couples topping’....
We don't know. This giant guy said "get a pizza saver", and here we are.
Can’t a guy get some privacy, I mean enywhere?
How dare you call my wife a topping!"
You said you were in the mood for a little dinner
We're celebrating Pi Day.
We had reservations.
We were at Alice’s Restaurant for the takeout pizza.
I'm sorry but this table is taken!
What were you expecting?
I never ordered the “peopleroni!”
I'm sorry we ate your pizza. We were hungry...
May we have a bit of privacy?
Actually, I'm Little Brutus and this is Little Octavia.
This is private box seating.
We're ready to order now.
Greetings from your friends at Dominos!
You SAID you wanted it extra cheesy!
If you have a better idea for 'Date Night' I'd love to hear it.
We'll need a set of tiny plates. And any tiny shoes you happen to have laying around."
The pizzeria ran out of shrimp topping, we’re the upgrade.
Sorry, only room for two.
Not only does it keep the top of the collapsing, you get to listen in on their dinner conversation
No more chianti?  How about some valpolicella?
Don't be disappointed; the pepperoni was nothing to rave about
You did ask for an authentic Sicilian pizza”
We support locally produced  products.
As a matter of fact, red wine also goes perfectly well WITHOUT pizza
First, it was bacon on a burger. Now it's people on a pizza?!
You and you're special toppings.  Why can't you order a plain one for a change?
This pizza company not only does delivers but includes instructions on how to eat it properly.
Sorry, but we were hungry.
Henry, I thought you were going to order a Veggie pizza?
You're surprised?! We were promised al fresco dining.
You were expecting maybe pepperoni?
I asked for cheesiest topping possible, not for a re-enactment of your  proposal.
We're working on a PhD on perspective relationships.
You did order it with everything, right?
We didn't order extra small, did we?
A moment ago, it was warm, dark, and probably a little cheesy. And now this.
‘
“Looks like they ran out of cheese.”
So you opened the door to an alternate universe. Are you happy now?
"Didn't I warn you? Any topping but magic mushrooms!"
Everyone loves Costco.
Did YOU order those? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I didn't order those
I guess we need to be more specific when we order a “meat lover’s pizza”.
We compromised on eating out and home delivery.
Do you mind? We're getting a little chilli out here.
Little something in the oven, eh?
Disgusting, right on the cheese. Do you know how dirty the bottoms of shoes are?
Dining in, huh...
Would you mind?
Why did you order the doppelganger again?
It's a slice of life
Damnit, now they know what they're used for."
The pizza and wine diet worked beyond expectations.
Tell me they didn't eat all the toppings, again.
It's a bit of a surprise but we both are here on a dare
Please let me explain - it's a long story.  This is my wife and we are Susan and John Pepperoni.
Don't worry, we're included in the price of a 16"
I don't think this is our pizza...
You ordered the 'Little Italia'?
It's not the best pizza we've ever had, 
but the atmosphere is warm and cozy.
We downsized.
how longdo we have to sit here before ordering?
We suggest the red.
We’re the Anchovies. Mort and Lydia Anchovy.
Did you order the small?
Oh yes, it was very good, but their portions are a bit small.  Join us for a spot of wine?
We were ment for something bigger
You ordered date night take out again?
I told you not to order from Round Table Pizza.
Are we not the dinner partners you requested?
It's a happy meal for adults.
Next time order the large pizza. You might want to check your Caesar salad also...
Why do you think they put this bistro table here?
Subtle.
Don't eat the pepperoni~ !!
She's Peppy and I'm Saucy.  What can we do for you?
Look, making a white sauce pizza is a process.
Excuse us, we're trying to have an intimate dinner here. Oh, and your Pizza Marghareta was wonderful...
Wow, a three dimensional topping!
Hey, where's our pizza?
We'd like to order now.
Jack warned us not to climb that beanstalk.
We are the Toppings, Anne and Chovie, eating out!
Sorry to disturb you but did you eat my pizza?
Didn't we order pepperoni?
They don't call it "world famous" for nothing
We come with the "surprise me" topping order.
I told him, "Fred, you should have tipped that maitre'd!"
I thought I told them to hold the Stan and Janet.
It’s just pizzas, all the way down.
That happens when you say, 

“Lilli, Put In 
an order for a whole pie, please.”
I guess those Pizzagate rumors were true.
Your welcome to join us for dessert and a little small talk
Hey PAL, you ever heard of squatter's rights?
This is a table for two, and we're celebrating our anniversary, so I would kindly ask you to butt out!
Our waiter seems to have forgotten where we are; could you get us both some more of the House red?
What did you order?"
"Pizza for two.
...and a millilitre each of Pinot Grigio please.
It's a metropolitan pie not a Neapolitan.
Min? Dad? What are you doing in there?"
The menu had changed quite drasticly, after it was found out that you indeed do become what you eat
Do you have any Petite Sirah?
Do you mind? We're on a date here. You can eat when we're done.
Well, that’s quite a Monday
Night Surprise Pizza! Break
out the Wasabi and chopsticks,
George.
You’re in the wrong cartoon
When you order dinner for two you got to say which two.
You ordered the Middle Eastern pizza with extra dates.
It was the only table we could book for Valentine's Day!
Sorry, but we had a reservation
What were you expecting from Restaurant-Style DiGiorno?
DEFINITELY' not tipping on this order
How many times must I remind you,? Pu the lid down!
Yeah! We finished the pizza. Now close the lid.
Oh, there you are.  The pizza was delicious.  Could you bring us two of those cinnamon things, please?
Please don't stare.
Don"t give us that look,lady. What metaphysical pizza are you and beard-boy there the toppings of
The chianti is right on the edge of becoming vinegar.
Are you the folks who ordered the pizza?
Chefai? Little Italy, little Italians, capish?
You clearly ordered the "Piazza."
I said  “ I want you to take me out.”  He thought I said, “I want to be Take Out.”
I said a slice of life not the whole pie
You ordered this pie from Caveat Emptor Pizza, right? Well, we're the Anchovies, Bob and Tina.
You definitely ordered an extra small couple, not a couple of extra smalls.
We will have 2 hamburgers and some extra napkins to get the sauce off of our shoes.
Meatlovers Pizza for Two ?
You ordered the Italian.  We're Italian.
You asked for a personal pizza, didn’t you?
Didn't you order a "Pizza inceptionna" ?
Hi, I'm Roni and this is my wife Pepper.
I never knew what that little thing is for
Guess we're eating for four tonight.
We were dining in the dark!
Jacob and Doris finally got the "mellow mushroom" pizza they had hoped for.
This is the last time we take restaurant recommendations from Jack.
Did you want pepperoni on your date night?
Well, somebody had to hold the pepperoni!
Your special order does not include a violinist.
when we asked for take-out, we didnt mean for it to be us!
We know, you're surprised because you ordered mushrooms. Right
Sorry, we finished it.
Is it so bad to try anything to connect with your son?? Have a slice of life!
Yes, I ordered a family-size, but this is ridiculous
I hate the local food movement.
But, we ordered out.
... Guess who came for dinner ?
We are the ghosts of dinners future. Keep ordering extra cheese and you won't live long enough to do this.
We’re just trying to grab a slice of the good life.
We have the table for another 10 minutes.
What's a guy got to do to get service around here?
Is this what they meant by a buy-one, get-two-free deal?
Sorry, I thought I ordered the large.
Do you have a table a little less tipsy?
How about a little privacy?
Would you please keep it closed? There's a draft.
Everyone wants a piece of the pie
I don't know we were just trying to do something different.
A little red wine would go really well.
Quit staring and bring us two milliliters of Merlot.
Hi, I'll have the sea bass and...is it me, or is it hot in here?
The deep dish includes "thoughtful conversation"
Ask him to mansplain it again!
What? You ordered in and we’re eating in.
It was a really delicious piazza but filling
I thought I just misheard when they said  'the Hams' were now included in 'the works' ."
Chow Bella, don’t look so surprised, we’re from your wedding cake, remember?
You did ask for extra toppings, right?
You did order a Round Table Pizza didn't you?
I said just cheese and they made us an interpersonal pan pizza!
Obviously someone thought this would be funny.  Is that Mr. Jonathan Swift back there?
Thanks.  You can leave the top open.
You ordered the Trickle Down Special. What did you expect?
We ARE gulten-free.
Do I come to your house and interrupt your dinner?!  Now shut the box!!!
Oh you said MEAT lovers pizza
Don't know about the pizza but this is definitely a great Chardonnay!
I thought I asked for cheese.
One bite, everyone knows the rules.
Another giant asshole bothering us. Let’s see what this one wants.
'Dining In' is definitely different these days.
We wanted to eat out, not eat in.
Well, we did order a family size pizza._
Excuse me, do you mind?!
I hear if you put them outside they'll just find their way back.
Could you top us off?
You may have seen the film with Matt Damon...
Must be extra toppings.
Family pizza tonight!
Please bring us some oregano.
Larry, I told you different toppings. Look how bland these look!
I thought I ordered Chinese?!
Careful. Like the deliver menu said, ‘No tipping.’
You did order a large with everything!
Nope, his taxes aren't in here either!
Not wasting food is the most effective way to reduce climate change, thank you for asking!
Unaware they’d ordered extra cheese with “the” Anchovies, the Wilborns reconsider.
Just because you may think I'm just one of the Little People doesn't mean you can hover over me and demand I give up my table before I've even finished my wine!
I order a small pizza but.....
This is the worst dinner cruise of my life.
I guess it’s better than pineapple on top.
Excuse me!  We didn't invite you!
This is what we call "Thinking inside the box".
Kinda hard to have romantic dinner in here when SOMEONE keeps letting all the cheese smell escape!
Do you mind?! We ordered the personal pizza special.
Who's coming to dinner?
Close the box you’re letting all the grease out
The critics were right  about your lousy ambiance.
It was delicious, thank you.
Were're discussing the topic of your pizza...
I agree. The wait times in Little Italy have gotten out of control.
I thought we ordered the special topping, but hold the casual diners?
You people have got to start reading the fine print. This is what you get with the Matt Damon Downsized Box Office Bomb Special with Everything.
Let me guest, you were going to leave without leaving a tip.
You got a pie topped with literary satire?
If you wouldn't mind giving us a little privacy...it's our anniversary.
You should have ordered an extra large.
Pizza, piazza, we're just having a drink!!
This was the special?!
Can't we have a little pizza quiet in here?
You may have asked for a meat pizza, but the order was written as meta.
We are almost finished and the table is yours.
You didn’t say “meatless.”
You’re upset?  We specifically asked to be seated in a deep dish.
Well, of course!  First come, first serve.
Let's check the date on this pizza.
She kept saying I never take her anywhere in 30 minutes or less.
Would you like to hear the specials for tonight?
ARE THEIR LITTLE CHAIRS MADE FROM CHAMPAGNE CORKS?
I think the Genie misunderstood our wish.
Don't be fooled by the box. It was a very very small  pizza.
Open the box one more time and I'll have you arrested.
I told you to make a reservation!
I heard you say it! "Hold the Sterns, please."
This does not pair well with pineapple.
The large pour will ruin your dinner.
Have you met my wife Alice?
What super heroes?  You ordered the Rom Com Classic.
At least we try to make date night a special occasion.
This isn't who I ordered.
Reduce, reuse, recycle in that order.
We were really hungry.
Excuse me, this is our dinner.
We needed a table in thirty minutes or less
That's a cheesy date on a small budget.
I warned you this would happen when you said 'yes in my back yard!'  Now here they come to take a slice of our pie!
We’ve been waiting for an hour ,where the fuck is the waiter?
I ordered a small pizza, but this is ridiculous.
When you re-order, go easy on the mushrooms.
We are Fred and Ethyl Gottenbottom.  Who are you?
OK.
We asked the waiter for a go box, and here we are.
That's the last time I get mushrooms on it.
Well, you did ask for a white pie.
Because we value each other and want to keep the spark alive, that’s why we’re here!
It's a pizza cake
Fergeddaboudit.
Don’t do the OA movements on pizza night!
Install a proper bathroom and you won’t have to worry about what is and what is not sausage.
Didn't you order the meet lovers pizza?
They forgot the pepperoni again.
The friend-to-table movement might just catch on.
You ordered " The Romantic Dinner for Two " Pizza ?
You did order a small.
Tell me ahain what topping you ordered
There must be some mistake. We’re not take out, we’re table service.
To top it off, we thought you might like company.
Hi, we’re the Pepperonis, I’m afraid there’s been a mix-up.
Best seats are always in the middle of the pizza.
Yes, we're Lilliputians but we have a big appetite. Sorry, we did not leave a slice.
Any chance of a booth instead, please?
We’re here for the dinner for two.
I'm eating' here..!
Thank you for choosing Irony Pizza.
At least there's no roaches.
So this is the "2 toppings Valentines Day" special
Puhleeze   You blew out the candle
What did you expect? You ordered the family sized pizza.
Let’s remember not to order nuclear family pizza again.
Just toasting your selection of toppings. We're complimentary...
Honey, did you order meat lovers, again?
Well clumsy thumbs, looks like you ordered a cheese piazza, huh?
We also thought 'Downsizing' was awful.
This foodie obsession for new toppings has gone too far.
Take-out?
I suggest an eyedropper when you serve more wine.
One way or another!
Nope, personal pan. In fact, it's our personal pan!
Skip the anchovy next time.
I ordered the meat lovers, not the lovers topping!
Just what you asked for.  No anchovies.
Hi! Are you celebrating Boxing Day with us?
Are you saying we're NOT meat lovers?!
I’ve heard a little Italy, but this is ridiculous!
You did order the conversation pie, didn't you?
What? They said you were lactose intolerant.
How hard can this be?  Select the delivery option in the app, I tell her.  And what happens? She still finds a way to mess it up.
I love pizza but it always disagrees with me.
Well, we couldn't find OUR pizza but we are ALL OVER yours.

Didn't they tell you what was in the take-out special?
Ayyyyy, marone! Close up da freakin' box, pal! Can't you see I'm tryna wet my freakin' salcheech over here?!
Is that their new meat lovers special?
They forgot the bell peppers.
I’m sure I ordered a foursome
These pizza toppings are really getting outside the box.
What did you THINK the table was for?!
We're from Gulliver's, the delivery before you.
We would have reserved you a table if we knew you were coming.
I thought we ordered the vegetarian pie?
You asked for cheese
Us?
We decided to try the little Bistro next to 
those big box stores.
They ran out of tomato sauce so we volunteered.
Would you believe we asked for a scene from an Italian restaurant?
You shouldn't have ordered double anchovies
Is out pizza ready yet?
Visualize where you see yourself in 10 years.
If I knew that’s where the old us was hiding I would’ve started eating carbs again a long time ago.
Hope you don't mind; we helped ourselves to a couple of small slices.
It’s from a mom and pop pizza joint!
Look, they used a slice of pepperoni for the table top.
Congratulations on purchasing the ‘Night Out’ hologram on your pizza!
Well look, someone here definitely asked if Mystic-Pizza "could somehow include a little stimulating company, for once". 
Here we are!
Since PizzaGate, we only eat takeout.
Any way you slice it, this seems cheesy
NOT TO BE CONCERNED, WE ARE OFFICIAL TASTERS
So you think you own the place?
You know we're all just on somebody else's pizza.
We’re out of the box now.
Did you order a mini pizza?
We’re meat lovers too.
Delivery again?
I thought this was an upper crust establishment!
You do know you still owe the rent for April?
You two ask, "what's the secret sauce to love and marriage?"
A cheesy date leads to a cheesy life.
No more kneading the dough.
This is what we were like before take-out pizza.
With our shrinking budget, it was the only table we could afford.
I think Postmates messed up our order...
We should all consider ourselves lucky. The previous order was for calzone.
excuse me, i didn't realize this is a personal pizza.
Ever since we downsized, we've become "experiencers".
They forgot the banana peppers again.
Honey, I Shrunk your Parents
Amore pizza?
Dudes, Vinnie's special mushroom topping is totally cosmic!
We put the 'casual' in casual dining.
This pizza doesn't agree with me.
The topping was awful but the wine is good.
What’s a guy got to do for a little privacy atound here?
We'll take desert in a to-go box.
Oooo, not exactly the take out I thought it would be.
Hi.  Would you mind bringing some extra parmesan?
We’d like a small pizza with everything on top.
I thought we said Friday at 7!
May we look at the dessert menu?
Happy Anniversary, Cesar!
You are invading our pizzary!
You ate the whole pizza!
We ordered non-alcoholic cheese, right?
What?! You were expecting anchovies?
I thought “To Serve Man” Meant Something Else.  I guess I shouldn’t have ordered from the Rod Serling Pizzeria.
Must be the appetizers.
How much longer are you going to keep this up?
You said you wanted dinner in a box!
Did you invite company?
Oh look, there is a world outside our box! 
Oh look, there is a world inside a box!
Did you at least leave us some wine?
You  an take the pizza out of the pizzeria, but...
This isn't what I meant by family size.
Sal's is way spendy... this table alone cost us each an arm and a leg.
Ah, now I understand the Yelp review about the Jack and the Beanstalk vibe.
We got caught up in the carry out part of the to go menu.
I'm the pizza drone pilot. We're just keeping it warm.
I remember family dinner!
Well, at least there's no pineapple.
Sorry, but we tossed the anchovies on the way over.
Inventor Dad, Jet-lagged already. Restore us to Life-size instantly
Honestly, we do try to recycle all plastic.
I'd slap you for interrupting our dinner, but my feet are stuck to the cheese.
People! People!
Double trouble"
Susannah Mills, Hiawatha, I
May we have some peanuts, please?
Oh hi!  We thought you might enjoy a little company when you dined.
Yes, we are pop-up musicians.
Do you happen to have a fortune cookie? We need a table runner.
When I said I wanted a reservation, this wasn’t what I meant.
I'm sorry, but we ate the pepperoni.
We asked for a small
We ordered "No Cut" crust but we're okay to share.
I like coconuts. They smell like ladies lying in the sun.
You were supposed to reserve that little table for pizza savers, not for pizza topping eaters.
We were looking for the piazza. But really this is quite cozy.
Yes we made table reservations which comes with a NYC dinning experience at a giant couples home
They're going to need a smaller box
Remember our first pizza date?
You must have mistakenly ordered Billy Joel's "Italian Restaurant."
That's a cheesy date, wouldn't you say?
So this is what 'Make America Great Again' looks like - downsizing wages to feed a growing Giant economy.
Uhh, looks like the topping slid off during delivery.
This doesn't feel very 'Amore' to me.
Take out only!!!    can you please get us closer to the exit...
I think they must have misheard me.
Are you here for our pop-up pizza party?
You ordered pizza for four?
Our reservation was to dine in not carry out.
I thought we'd try the dine-in special.
Can we have the box?
Looks like Little Italy came to us.
We understand you specialize in "big" wine.
What's holding up the pizza?
I warned you not to order delivery from Little Italy.
Just in time!
Reuse repurpose recycle” a small step for mankind and giant leap for small mankind.
Jeez, I've never even heard of pizza al fresco in miniature.  Is that, like, a thing now
This is what we call dining out!
I didn’t think this was what you meant when you said we’re having little people for dinner.
They're supposed to JUST keep the cheese from sticking to the lid .
May we please have some privacy?
They were out of pepperoni.
Date pizza? What’d you expect?
Romantic couples don't taste good!
Hey buddy, do ya mind!? We´re trying to have dinner here
I'm Dan Chovy and this is my wife Ann.  Who the heck are you?
A little privacy, please?
We haven't seen our waiter for 30 minutes or less!
Could you kindly move a little to let us check whether they in fact doubled the cheese?
Now that we've established this is a fiasco and you're having US over dinner, we respectfully request that the Chianti you pour is DOCG!
Can we peek at the dessert menu?
I asked for a vegetarian pizza
You must be the jerks who ordered anchovies.
The least you could do is knock before blowing the roof off this place!
It's our first date, do you guys have the wine list by chance?
Close the lid; this is a private conversation.
We asked to split a small.
Did you order the piccolo pizza? We’re the Piccolos!
Well, in a former life we were The Roaches, but we came back as people.  By-the-way, you should try the mushrooms.
Do you mind? We're eating here!
Luigi thought you ordered  10" people! His smallest pizza is 12".
You ordered a giant pizza. We are here to prove that you are.
We put our Ted talks on compact discs.
Don't close the lid on our relationship.
Ikea's branched out into pizza.
I thought we asked for no dates.
We’re almost finished; we had a small pizza
We wouldn't sit on a deep-dish pie
Sorry, occupato.
Did you order extra spicy?
We’ve been on a waitlist for this table for sixteen months.
Avery Theng and I are here at your request.
Alice's makes the best mushroom pizza.
This isn’t Italy”
Carl, we just entered the Pizzalite Zone
could you give us a little privacy
Trust us, they never give us extra cheese either.
Sorry, they had only two toppings.
That little ride was rather uncomfortable!  Now, where's our wine?!
For a special dinner we felt we should think inside the box....
Hello there. We're the Pepperonis, and this is our pizza.
Do you mind!?! I’m having lunch with your Aunt Chovies!
Honey, it looks like the neighbors invited themselves over again.
Hi, we're the Napoletanas. Marie and Tony.
But I thought we ordered pizza!!!
There must be a mistake - this is not my order.
OK! You're right. "Honey I shrunk the Kids"  was probably a bad choice for that year's birthday party.
Your parents' warning is bothering your conscience isn't it?
Another Gulliverian Pie? I guess you don't care that I hate footprints in my cheese...
Weigth Watchers pizza on line is miraculous.”
When I said I didn’t care about the toppings I was talking about pineapple
So. This is where you been hiding the bottles?
Dave,I thought I asked for my pizza with 3 mini humans this is blasphemy.

They better not have taken my expensive wine Carren
You think you're confused!  All we did was ordered "carry out" and somehow we got carried out.
When you realize your order hasn't even been made.
I know, I know, they screwed up, you ordered a non-white couple.
Brooklyn Style - San Marzano tomatoes, grass-fed mozzarella, third Tinder date this month, forty-seven thousand in high interest student loans

gluten-free crust +$7
What? You specifically asked for Olive with a little extra Basil.
'No, I think it's you that's very small.'
Puulleezz. 
Close the lid – you’re ruining the mood!
They're not enough for our dinner.
What's wrong? Eyes bigger than your stomachs?
Sorry, this is Piazza di Gina, not di Gino Pizza.
We don't need a menu on account of the fact that we brought our own food.
We'll be done with our wine in just a minute.
Well at least they haven't put pineapple on it.
Pepperoni? WE ordered pepperoni.
Watch out for the horses!
And you thought pizza didn't scale.
They weren’t kidding, it really is a small dinner for two.
Well if it isn't aunt and uncle chovy.
Mr. and Mrs. Anchovy. You did order pizza Napoli, didn't you?
FYI, after we eat, we’re gonna have sex on the pizza. I know, it’s a cheesy joke no matter how you slice it.
I said a Marinara, not a Mother and Father!
So, that's what that little round thing is for!
Haven't you ever heard of a tiny house?
It keeps our feet warm.
Please hurry up, your floor is getting cold.
What else did you think this thing was used for?
Do you mind?  We are trying to have a nice dinner date.
It's our niche market.
Ew! Who puts dates on pizza?
My parents always manage to think outside the box.
Deep dish pizza of bygone dating days.
We're dining out.
Don't you think we're entitled to a little break after carrying a box that size up a beanstalk?
Ralph, I didn't know they were genetically modifying people too.
What did you expect when you ordered from Gulliver’s Pizzas?
Fortunately, a slice couldn't fit on their table.
Mind if we finish our wine before you enjoy your " Monday mystery topping"?
Pretty sure I just ordered mushroom and onion.
Close the box.
I don't want another Bloody Mary but I suppose they're going to pour us some Tabasco anyways.
Think of this as a thought projection of what your life could have been like if you hadn't married that idiot with a beard.
Hey shut the lid lady, will ya?" 
Jeez Marie, Whaddaya got to do to get some pizzan quiet around here?
Of course we ate the toppings. We're the meat lovers!
Instead of toppings, how about topical conversation?
Renting options have certainly become limited.
This panned personally.
We heard you were downsizing.
lower the lights, please
Huh, now we know why they named the joint "Slice of Life Pizza".
Dear I think you ordered Anne and Jovi?
When I really look under the cover, I can see pieces of who we once were, but it's grown so cold.
Looks like they are eating in tonight.
Oh no they actually ment midget pizza is that my brother bob?
We're waiting for the check.
Did you request this table?
We finally found a table our size . . .
Hi. I' m Pepper and he's Ronnie.
Pull up a chair.......We might be small but we are BIG talkers!
The family style trend is officially played out.
Oh,Oh!  They delivered us an "eat in" pizza!
'I ordered my parents a shrimp pizza to pair with Pinot Grigio'
It’s a shame what a mother has to do to see her daughter.
I thought I told you to order the Meat Lover's.
I told you God was a woman.
Guess I should have clarified what was included in the “mini meal deal.”
I think they are peopleroni’s
When I ordered a mini-pizza, I only asked for a mushroom topping.
Cheer up.  You won the contest.
Did you say you ordered pepperoni, or Lilliputian?
You ordered a pizza with everything...
Yes, there is a word for it, and that word is ‘table.’
You look like you've seen a ghost pepper.
Sicilian’s all right, but we prefer Lilliputian.
I ordered it from the new  place called Pizza House
The ‘Pizza-Date’ conspiracy, resolved.
Next time, don’t order the Mediterranean diet pizza.
If the cartoonist had drawn my date and I looking at each other instead of up at you, this cartoon would not have needed a caption.
Blame Rick Moranis
Pizza delivery isn't what it used to be.
This is meaningless
No, I thought you had the check.
Who are you?  Peeping Ray's Best?
Ironic, huh, that we ended up here after our hopes were crushed.
YES! We all know it was 30 minutes or less but give us one more for sakes!!!
I thought your ordered  vegan?
what?
These Willy Wonka toppings are getting ridiculous.
What's this? I ordered Pepperoni.
GUS, THIS “LAND OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE” THEME HOUSE IS CREEPY. gus, this “land of the giants” theme restaurant is creepy.
These are The Toppings I was telling you about.
What do you mean, it's not the Mob?! First, we narrowly avoid Vinnie, the Slasher. Then, the roof is blown off, and suddenly we're dining al fresco?
When I hit your eye, that's amore.
We are just trying ok keep a roof over out heads
We heard about this place on Yelp.
I said "pizza party," not "Donner Party"!
Cheapskates!
Are we in Wonderland?
Looks like they skimped on the dates again
I swear I said gluten free.
Well you DID ask for "all dressed"
Close the lid! This is our special boite!
We'll be finished in 30 minutes or less.
Pepperoni, Mushroom and Olive please, with a green salad.
You said 'Let's Eat In,' but this is taking it too far.
You just ruined our mood lighting.
No, no mistake.  We’re Ted and Laura Pepperoni.
Oh, hi, son! Meet Stewart—the man I’ve been telling you about.
Sorry, we thought you ordered "eat in'".
ciao bella! this is your pizza...dream experience delivered!
Looks kind of boring
We didn't order any giants.
We'll have the very spaghettini, please.
Didn't we order the vegan?
Sorry, she’s not into

The pizza's still in the oven, but you can join us for drinks.
Please tell us youre not gluten-free
You ordered a small with capers, right? Let's begin.
I said dates, not date
We ran out of the Kittens, we are the Happy Couple Toy...
What. You've never heard of downsizing?
Lousy wine.
It's a downgrade from weddings, but at least we now have table service.
Didn't you order a small Viennese pizza
Fine pizza restaurant this turned out to be.
Didn't you see the sock on the box corner?
Sure, whatever, you go ahead and book the AirBnB the next time we go anywhere, but like, seriously, this place was SUCH a bargain
I'm Nick Pepperoni, and this is my wife, Louise Pepperoni!

We are part of your combo meal.
Table for two?
Sorry for the mix-up.I never mentioned super size
Could you come back a little later? I'm still trying to get my piece of this spicy Italian.
I'm lactose-intolerant, so cheese is out. She is gluten-free, and neither of us likes tomatoes, so what do you say we have chicken or beef?
The Shiraz went really well with the Pepperoni. Crust is all yours.
Are you sure you meant 'vegeTARIAN pizza'?" -Markell West, Laurel, Marylan
Maybe everything does have a purpose
Today's special!
We recommend the Chablis.
excuse me, we are trying to enjoy our date.
We're into Cheesey
Do, you mind?! You ordered Deep Dish and we're not done discussing whether some knowledge is universal or if it is all built from the study of things that happen in the world.
You didn't miss much. The pepperoni was mediocre at best.
Piazza Viola Concert?
Dwarfino's Delivers
It's intended as a representation of the inception of the pizza date, not a health code violation.
You said pepperoni not peopleroni
Did you buy the insurance?
Giuseppi promised us a private room.
Oh, they thought you ordered a couple for pizza.
We need napkins...lots of them.
Should we just eat around the topping ?
The meaning isn't that deep. This ain't Chicago style.
Singing pizzatelegraminis...another great reason to genetically modify humans.
Help us, oh God!
Hey! You asked for us. This is Auntie Pasta and I’m Papa Roni.
We recommend the Santa Fe with extra pine nuts

BuurrrppP!
I said, 'We're thinking pizza,' and everything went dark.
We’re doing quality control for the Little Italy Pizzeria.
Oh your pizza’s ruined? You know how hard it is to get a table here?!
Eating in meant forking over extra dough.
We didn’t think you’d miss the extra pepperoni....
We'll have your extra large homestyle pepperoni with extra cheese and two large diet colas.
Pizza was better before politics got into it.
Sorry, bud. It was either this table or getting street cart hot dogs on the first date.
Oh Shoot, they forgot the garlic sauce.
We are the Little Caesars you ordered for dinner.
She wanted dine-in and I wanted carry-out, so we compromised.
This is taking home d
Next time, please leave out the anchovies!  They kill the mood.
Hey, we're Dining in the Dark over 'ere!
You want a table with a view?
Happy Anniversary!
For a tip, just double the tax.
On our planet the restaurants look exactly like gigantic pizzas in a box.
So, next time don't order your pizza from Dominates.
Watch these two eat us out of house and home.
The lid’s for ambience.
I hate microwave pizza!
It stays hotter in here with the the cover over it.
Oh, all meat? No, this is all meta. Our order taker is dyslexic.
Cut us a slice, will ya?
This was our only way to escape the all-you-can-eat buffet.
So that’s what they meant in the commercials... a taste of fine dining
We're the other kind of meat lovers.
You specifically ordered the Pizza Palace "Supreme."  So, here you go --- meet Mary Wilson.
We're here to help murder your thirst
Excuse me, where is our pizza? We've been waiting for over an hour!

You ordered the plain talk pizza, right?  Well, it's plain, and we're talking, so stop complaining.
You did order the pizza dinner for two, didn't you?
If you don’t mind, we’re handing over our eating-from-big-box routine.
The Pepperoncini was delicious, could we see a dessert menu?
You never heard of super-minisized-deli?
No, let's NOT have takeout for dinner again! I've conjured up our younger selves to remind us of the pleasures of dressing up and going out.
See, I told you so. It's not a pizza saver because we're in the Twilight Zone.
Well, your open lifestyle still holds extreme lollypopguildophobia!
Anchovies would have been better.
We've been waiting here 30 minutes or less.
Are they gluten free?
Pull up another chair, grab a couple slices, and listen to our story you will not believe! Incredible! Preposterous! Unheard of!
The two of us...Decimated!
Honey, is this life’s way of saying we don’t get out enough.
You did order two miniatures from the bar.
Its the only table we could get at this hour.
If you take a picture it'll last longer.
We decided to spend your birthday with you after all.
I ordered the giant pizza, not the GIANT pizza!
Do you mind? We’re dining in complete darkness to heighten our other senses.
We're sorry you were delivered the wrong pizza, but please close the lid.  We were trying to have a romantic, private dinner.
Why did you think they called it a pizza table?
Well, we found the olives.
The Yelp reviews said service was slow but there was nothing about this, was there, honey?
We would really appreciate a bottle of red.
Didn't you know? Little Caesar has a family!
...and this is my wife Sylvia Anchovy. I don’t see the problem since you ordered a pizza with just a little Anchovies.
Are you being served?
When you ordered you must have selected both "Dine In" and "Take Away"
This isn't what I envisioned when you said double date...
When you’ve finished your apéritif, we are going to eat you.
Next time, enter your order as the 'small pizza lovers special', not the 'special small pizza lovers'!
Honey, how much extra did they get you for the couple dining topping??!
Excuse me, we're drinking inside the box!
Oh, shucks...there’s no Arugula on it!
No, we're not the Mushrooms.  Sorry.
Please. We're trying to finish our meal.
What did you expect?  Black olives and onion.
Don't close the lid!
Too cheesy?
Can you leave us alone ‘til our pizza’s ready?
Hi! We're the Lillipizzans...there should be enough for everyone!
Let me get this right —Green New Dealer— you never cared that these perfect little tables are made from fossil fuel?”
My stomach's already rumbling.
I swear, honey, everyone wants a piece of you!
Yeah Josh, it is a pie from my parents about what dating use to be like.
You say your names are Anne Chovies and Arty Chokearts?
You didn’t say you wanted anchovies.
I know we're intruding but, seriously, what two adults order a plain cheese pizza? What are you, five?
We thought ‘Free Delivery’ meant something else.
It's Lilliput family size, with toppings set
Do you think it's still vegan?
You're the one who ordered extra cheese.
No worries - we're vegetarian and gluten-free.
Magic Mushroom and Olive?
Next time choose a topping or two and we'll pick a different joint.
This IS Round Table
Their new topping is people-roni.
We like to drink inside the box.
What is it about "a private table for two" that you don't understand?
We reserved this table 6 weeks ago.
We love pizza in the box.
When do you expect delivery?
What do you want me to tell you? You're the one who ordered mushrooms.
Please! Is it too much to ask for a little privacy while we're eating?
Comes with anchovies, West Coast style!
Do you mind!! We'd like a bit of privacy here.
Dave always got carried away on first dates.
They did say 'When you're here, you're family'...
I'm sorry, but there is just no way that a red wine works with pizza.
No, our last name is not Ceaser!
What took you so long? It was supposed to be 30 minutes or less.
Will you be dining in, or taking that to go?
They weren't kidding when they said that they'll add extra cheese..
Lid back down, please, we’re trying to have a quiet meal.
Can we get a little privacy in here?
Have any Grey Poupon?
Portion sizes are really getting bigger.
Your PieHoles don't count here
That will be five dollars plus an Uber.
Did you order the couples special?
Where’s the pepperoni?
No...I absolutely do not believe in the "domino" effect.
Hi there.  Bert and Linda Anchovies.  Nice to meet you.  What’s that?  You ordered no...oh, geez...well this is embarrasing.
You didn't order the shrink-wrapped family special?
This isn’t right. I didn’t order a dinner for two with wine pizza deal.
Does this crusty merry-go-round ever end?
Those are some weird looking mushrooms.
This is the original Pizza Hut.
We should have gone with Magarita
I hope you're not going to ruin our romantic dinner tonight!
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!
I didn't know we were having guests!
Would you two gentlemen like to join us for a drop of brandy after dinner?
Oh look. A snack.
I asked for extra meat, not extra meta.
Yeah, we will want a refund, too! We booked this box 40 deliveries ago!
I know!  We're bummed that they ran out of anchovies, too.
We assumed it was dine in only.
We ordered, “” taken out.””
I think that you mistakenly ordered Pisa instead of pizza.
It’s been thirty minutes, and I don’t see a pizza. The meal’s on you.
Close it. It'll get cold.
You'd think they would have left  a little bit.
Family of four...still waiting for our slice of the Pie.
How long have you been waiting to be discovered?
Looks like happy hour doesn't end til 7 on Mondays.
How are those garlic knots coming along?
Jeez, they've messed up our order again.
Denver, Colorado: Shroom Pizza
I'm sorry!  We were hungry, and we ate up your pizza while it was still in the delivery truck.                                                                
Richard Coan, rwcoan@cox.net
Can't a man get some privacy with his ex-wife?
We'll finish in 30 minutes or the pizza's on us.
Settle an argument. Is this place cheesy?
Satisfied? You had to see it used for another purpose.
I know your Thumbalina's family, but just once, couldn't we have a little privacy for an intimate romantic dinner?
What did you think you ordered?
The next time I lift this lid you better make like a pepperoni
Diorama is "Today's special".
Why they are here, looks like recently shrunken. How long have you two been spying on us?
Hey, bub! This slice is reserved for two!
We're part of the rewards promotion.
We're just here as a reminder of what date night is supposed to look like.
With a pizza this big, wine should have been included.
No, we're not pepperoni!
We ordered anchovies not sardines
Don't you dare eat us with a fork.
Do you mind? We still have an hour on our reservation.
Who did you expect, Tom Dewey?
No, a small Piazza Deluxe dinner is NOT the same as a small pizza deluxe!
Oh so that's why pizzas have those tabels!"
Would you  mind closing the roof?
I thought that $5.99 special was just too good to be true.
Hey! I am happy you got some traction on your cause. How about a little privacy for mine?
You probably shouldn't have asked for home delivery.
Look Fred, even they went out to eat.
I am talking with this lady now, I can take you out later. Say 11 pm tonight?
Net time would you mind leaving off the anchovies.
Chef's special. Pizza Alfresco.
The mini-fridge was full.
Please tell the chef to hurry up -we're starving...
I’m not sure about this new diet.
I was expecting more from the Museum of Pizza.
I’m sorry sir but I’m afraid the carpet design looks too much like a pizza.
My back needs a cushion, but afterwards the pepperoni is yours.
Oh dear, I forgot to tell them to hold the 'anchovies AND the Barones' .
I’m gonna have to leave one heck a of a Yelp review for this one.
Somebody owes us some dough.
who invited you?
paul rudd is daddy?
You said extra crusty...
Don’t blame me. I specifically said no anchovies—and no Lilliputians."
I thought I ordered pineapple...
Huh, I don’t remember ordering this pizza with dates?!?

So, cost was not what you meant when you said you were getting squeezed by COBRA.

First tell me how you got here.
Do you have COBRA?
Well, the shortness of breath could be caused by any number of things.

Monty, is that your python?
You have what used to be called “the grippe”.
Sorry for the wait, Mr. Baker....So, what brings you in to see us today?
Yes, we've recently been seeing a lot of this in South Florida. It's called Reptile Disfunction.
He may not be in your network, but I can refer you to an excellent mongoose.
Good news. It should fall off on its own in four to six days.
I regret to inform you...it's the E-boa virus.
Any recent trips overseas?
So what brings you here?
It appears you are suffering from vipertension.
I’ll order a coilonoscopy.
OK  you can put your pants back on
I’ve seen this go a couple of ways ...
I'm prescribing a flute and music lessons.
It is going around, I can tell you thát.
It says here that you've been under a lot of pressure lately...
When I said a restricted diet, I meant a calorie-restricted diet.
So who am I here to see today?
Otherwise, you're in perfect health.
Sorry, this is Hematology.
You want Herpetology.
Good thing you're covered by Cobra.
Sorry, but there's no cure for the common coiled.
Lets start with the good news, your ankles look great
Your insurance form says you have COBRA coverage.
You’re okay, but it sounds like he might have a frog in his throat.
Shortness of breath can be caused by many things. Let’s not jump to conclusions.
Is that the same one as last time?
Actually, I don't think your Cobra policy does cover this.
So what brings you into Urgent Care today?
I can remove him, no problem, just be more careful around humans in the future.”
Take two field mice and call me in the morning.
Your vitals are OK. Your bloodwork is good. No sign of heart disease. So I'm going to say the tightness in your chest is from the snake.
Unfortunately, this won't be covered by Cobra.
Well, your labs all came back normal. So, I guess we’re back to square one.
The good news is that your hiccups are gone.
Nice try, Mr Rosen, but there's no escaping your prostate exam.
These days we have many successful treatments for ereptile dysfunction.
I could remove it but they usually come right back.
Good news.  It's not your prostate.
Did you eat the apple?
I highly recommend you set aside some time to unwind.
I'm glad we caught this early.
I'll just need your signature in three places.
Two mice tonight, and call me in the morning.
Well it’s covered but only if your employer offers COBRA.
Any pets in the home?
It says here you have COBRA insurance?
Ironically, yes, I do believe this is covered under your COBRA.
Do you hear a rattle when you cough?
I'm sorry, but COBRA and BOA are actually two separate policies.
With your plan, it's the only way to measure your blood pressure.  Just wait until you see how we check your prostate.
Yes, that's probably a python, but I'd like to do CAT scan and a few other expensive tests to be sure.
The test results are back. We think it's a snake.
I see you're covered by Aetna and Petplan."
And just what brings you in today?
Feed it two mice, and call me in the morning.
Results won’t be back for a few days, but from what I can tell, it’s a snake.

Your snake's fine, Mr. Jones, but I suggest you see a physician immediately!
I'm prescribing a muscle relaxant for the Boa
So, do you want to live free or die?
I’m going to send you over to the zoo for a second opinion.
Are you covered under COBRA?
Yes, it's been going around.
I'm also going to have to ask you to remove your boa.
I see you picked up something from your trip to the Amazon.
Have you traveled to any foreign countries in the past month?
It looks like you have a preexisting constriction.
And I see you're now covered by COBRA.
Looks like you’ve caught something that’s been going around.
And when was you last boa movement?
Hmm.. Bad news... you’re not covered for pre-existing constrictions...!
It's grown a lot since your last visit.
...and I would consider another service animal.
It's something that's going around.
Yeah, there’s definitely something going around.
All the lab tests are coming back negative. Quite frankly, we’re baffled.
Give it two hamsters and call me in the morning.
Unfortunately, your plan does not cover pre-existing constrictors.
Yes, Bob... definitely a case
of Irritable Boa Syndrome.
Believe it or not, you're actually going to want to use snake oil for this.
Take two rodents and call me in the morning.
And have you travelled to any tropical countries in the past 30 days?
Does anyone besides you see the snake?
Preliminary tests indicate it's a snake.
You’re in luck...we accept Cobra.
Of course if it swallows you first we’ll have to try something more aggressive:
This should hold you until you can afford the gastric band.
Let's double the dosage on the muscle relaxer. Try giving it to the snake this time.
…and stay off planes.
You may experience some loss of bladder control.
When did you become aware of the python, Monty?
I'm prescribing a muscle relaxer for your partner.
I think you just need to unwind.
Actually, this is the one thing your plan does cover.
Unfortunately, it’s an endangered species and we will have to let your condition run it’s course.
The good news is we identified the problem. The bad news is he’s hungry.
You can leave your snake on for this part of the exam.
Your blood pressure is quite elevated Mr. Jones, so I'm writing you a prescription for that. I wouldn't worry about the snake, it seems quite healthy.
Otherwise, it was a good vacation?
About your insurance--it seems you have COBRA?
I'm sorry, it's an endangered species.
Nice boa! Now what brings you in?
Would you prefer a gown?
Well, I don't know what to tell you.  All your labs came back normal.
You're not the first man to come in here with Ereptile Disfunction.
I think I see what the problem is, but your insurance requires that I get a second opinion.
Any other complaints?
Any discomfort?
And what brings you into the office today?
Sorry, I'm a hematologist... I'm writing you a referral to the herpetologist.
Sir, it seems you've contracted e-boa
The good news is that the cancer won't kill you.
Any complaints since your last visit?
The good news is your cholesterol levels are fine. The bad news is your blood pressure is 650 over 400.
Some airlines have tightened their rules lately, but this letter might help.

I'm prescribing a strong mongoose.
Next of kin?
Just give this letter to the airline and you should have no problem traveling with Simon.
I'm giving you something to help you unwind.
Good news! It's definitely not your heart.
Unfortunately, your insurance company lists this as a pre-existing condition.
Actually, I'd prescribed a vasoconstrictor. But your pressure has responded well.
You think you’re being squeezed now...wait til you see my bill.
New York Fashion Week already?
So, you're insured through COBRA?
It says here your insurance doesn't cover preexisting constrictions.
Sorry, but this is a python and you have COBRA.
And what brings you in today?
We think we know the problem, but we'll check you for Lyme disease just in case.
You have coilitis.
I should probably skip asking you to take a deep breath.
You're fine, Bob, but your python has diarrhea. Good luck.
Your test results came back fine, but I'm afraid the snake has bronchitis.
You've got what's going around
I recommend a coilonoscopy.
It works like any laxative, but faster.
I know the feeling.  I have student loans.
Yes we can remove it. No it's not called a Hissterectomy.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the pressure?
... sorry, it says here you’re only covered if he actually bites you.”
We've found it works faster than laxatives.
Trust me.  This is the best remedy for constipation you’ve ever seen.
Was there a woman and an apple involved?
It seems the monkey on your back was eaten by something else.
The good news is your snake is going to be OK.
I know our website says that we accept COBRA coverage, but this isn't what we meant.
We 'll have to run some expensive tests, but fortunately you're covered by Cobra.
The snake is in terrific shape.
I'm going to prescribe a small goat to help relieve that tightness.
It's just something that's been going around.
Let me prescribe something to help you unwind.
Don't worry, it will shed in a few weeks.
I don't think this is covered in your COBRA policy
Your snake's fine. I just want to remind you again that there is no need to take your clothes off at a veterinarian's office.
I suggest you take some time to unwind.
We think the reason for your difficult breathing is the snake, but to be sure, we’d like to run some tests..
Look, I respect your persistence... but a snake coiled around your naked body is, again, not a good reason for me to prescribe medical marijuana.
When did you first notice a man in your coils?
This treatment has cured hiccups in 94.7% of those surviving the procedure.
I see you selected the COBRA option on your insurance plan.
I'm going to give you something for ereptile dysfunction.
I’m sorry but it looks like your insurance plan covers boa constrictors, anacondas, and other members of the boa family, but what you have there is a reticulated python.
Glad I could squeeze you in.
Lucky for you your COBRA coverage has kicked in.
As a veterinarian, I don't see anything wrong with him.
It's as effective as gastric bypass, but less invasive.
I'm going to go ahead and schedule you for a hiss-terectomy.
Your insurance won't cover you until there's a fifth coil.
The good news is that it’s not a tapeworm.  The bad news...
I see you have been spending time in the White House.....
And remember this next time you promise to drain the swamp.
This is the last letter I'm writing for your emotional support animal.
Take two Aspirin and lie down on a flat rock in the sun.
My problem with these trendy diets is that as soon as the snake comes off, you're eating again.
Give him two small mice and call me in the morning!
So, what brings you here today?
I see your COBRA payments have kicked in.
When did you first start to feel contractions?
I checked with your COBRA plan and unfortunately they aren't going to cover it.
Let's have a follow-up appointment when the contractions are less than five minutes apart.
Nice try, but I'm still going ahead with your colonoscopy.
This antidepressant should help him unwind.
You need to find a different support animal.
I'm not so much concerned about when you last ate, as I am with when it last ate.
I'll write the prescription more legibly this time.
You've got a snake, I'm left-handed; we all have our problems.
It looks like you’re covered under COBRA.
The tests were inconclusive.  It's either a Burmese or Madagascar python.
You need to stop blaming Eve...
Definitely come see me if you notice it getting bigger.
We'll need to get some bloodwork done just to be sure.
We'll just need your signature here before we can begin treatment.
Does he usually frighten this easily when he goes to the vet ?
For starters, you've become too attached to your pet.
Actually, when I said a pet could help lower your blood pressure, I was thinking more of a dog or a cat.
Unfortunately, an anti-hiss-tamine won’t help this time around.
So you’re still using your Cobra insurance?
This isn't covered by your insurance. Come back if it bites.
Unfortunately, COBRA doesn't cover Boas.
And Eve, how is she feeling today?
This is one time that I think snake oil will really work.
He'll get hungry in about 6 weeks, but until then just don't piss him off.
I should've gone with the leeches.
So, you say it is more of a hiss rather than a ringing in your ears?
It says here you’ve been under a lot of pressure lately.
The snake actually covers you better than your health insurance does.
Let's see . . . non-smoker, no history of major illness, no surgeries . . . so, what brings you in today?
Has anything changed since last year's physical?
Have you traveled outside the country in the past few weeks?
Frankly, I'm more concerned about your cholesterol​.
In your case, paying out of pocket will be a challenge.
Well...despite what WebMD says, the numbness in your legs isn't cancer.
In fact, it is the opposite of a tape worm.
For a middle-aged snake your vitals look pretty good -- and I see your hunting skills are still up to par.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson, but this isn't covered by COBRA.
I’m prescribing a muscle relaxer.
Well I'm glad we could squeeze you in.
I'll prescribe you an antiboatic.
So WebMD told you it was likely cancer?
The good news, it's not poisonous.
Okay, lets try one blink for yes and twice for no!
Yes, it’s clearly something that’s going around.
A vet would've been a lot less expensive.
Of course you’re constipated... your asp is too tight...
Alright, I'm going to check your blood pressure. You may feel a gentle squeezing sensation on your arm.
As your vet, I'm going to prescribe a Valium to help you unwind, which should take care of that annoying human.
So Eve told you that an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
Do you know when the boa last ate?
Yes, there is something definitely going around.
It’s okay, choosing the right therapy animal takes time.
You're fine, but your snake is stressed out and needs to unwind.
I'm prescribing a muscle relaxant -- not for you, for your friend.
First a monkey on your back and now this?
What brings you in to see me today?
What seems to be the trouble today?
I'm sorry it took so long for you to be seen, but for future reference "There's a boa around my neck" has multiple meanings.
Any changes since your last check up?
Any other symptoms besides the tightness in your chest?
Take two live mice and call me in the morning.
Here, this may help you unwind.
Your cobra plan should take about 6 weeks to kick in.
First, let me just say how impressed I am that you managed to change out of your clothes.
This is the only case where prescribing snake oil actually works.
I think it’s a pre-existing constriction.
Take these twice a day with food. Also, you may want to do something about the snake.
It looks like a severe case of irritable boa syndrome.
We bought our medical equipment from the wrong Amazon.
A little snake oil should do the trick.
On a scale of hug to asphyxiation, how would you describe this tightness in your chest?
This should get the two of you on the plane.
This compression device should reduce the swelling.
He seems perfectly healthy
You don't have COBRA.
Kick once for yes, two for no.
If there's nothing else I'll just go get my flute.
I’m afraid you have the original preexisting condition.
So ‘Adam’ is it?
It says here you're still covered by COBRA.
The good news is we’ve resolved your low blood pressure issue.
Well, of course, that could be the source of your chest pain, but wouldn’t you feel better if we ran a few tests first?
Sorry, but your comfort animal will have to stay in the waiting room.
I don't care if it makes you calm. I'm not signing this airline form.
How big was he when you got him?   Where is your wife?
I'm going to write you a little something to help you unwind.
And finally Adam, do you feel safe at home?
Well, your blood pressure is high, but that won’t matter much longer.
There's been a lot of this going around and around.
Next I'd like to examine you without your comfort animal.
This should keep the swelling down.
I’d still like to run a few tests to be sure.
The good news is he says you're 120 over 80.
Im gonna prescribe a muscle-relaxant. That'll straighten him out.
I’m going to prescribe you some antihisstamines.
Thanks to the Republicans this seems to be the one thing you actually have coverage for.
The results are in from the lab. It’s a python.
So this happened right after she handed you the apple?
So tell me, Frank, how long have you been experiencing erreptile disfunction?
You also have chlamydia.
I see you've met our colonoscopist.
As your veterinarian, I'm concerned that you've formed an unhealthy attachment to this man.
Well, you're the third patient today with a mistaken Amazon delivery.
So what seems to be bothering you?
So...what brings you here today Mr. Jones?
First time in Florida?
It's been going around.
I’m going to prescribe a mongoose.
Unfortunately, your new insurance won't pay for the scope, but Alice here knows her way around a colon. She'll be wearing a Go-Pro.
Ah, I see you’ve already met Dr. Boa. He’ll be preforming your colonoscopy today.
So, how can I help you today?
Not a serious problem - probably  doesn’t know you from Adam
Sorry, but the insurance will not approve the operation without your signature.
She’s less accurate than the normal blood pressure machines, but she also helps with the mice.
Sorry but your insurance doesn't cover pre-constricted conditions
Your tests came back normal. It’s probably just anxiety.
As a veterinarian, the snake will be my first priority.
Now which toe did you say is bothering you?
I'll give you something to help you unwind.
Well.....you might want to consider a different therapy pet.
I will prescribe a mongoose. If that doesn’t work, come back next week
Shortness of breath is quite common with your condition
I think he has a crush on you.
All I can say is that must have been some bachelor party.
Stick out your tongue. No, not you... him.
So, why have you come to see me today?
I'm afraid I specialize in internal medicine. Come back once it has consumed you.
Before I get to the diagnosis, I have to ask how you got undressed.
It's probably just pressure - you should go somewhere and unwind.
Ah, yet another case of an Amazon order gone awry.
Give it three mice every four hours and call me in the morning.
I'm not sure COBRA will cover this.
More testing, yes. But my gut says it's the giant reticulated python.
I know your in a tight spot right now, but if you could sign these forms it'd be great.
And have you been under any extra pressure lately?
Your eyes look good, so I'm taking you off the vasoconstrictor.
I'm sorry, but this is considered a pre-existing condition.
This is not what we meant by `support animal’
So, what brings you in to see us today?
What seems to be the problem here?
And you say this all started when he gave your wife an apple?
Any pre-constricting conditions?
There are several causes of cold feet.  It could be 
a circulation problem.
OK, so the inhaler didn’t work.
I see you’ve met our claims adjuster.
I'm prescribing an anti-compressant
Any family history of this sort of thing?
Looks like this time he charmed the pants off of you.
I won't lie to you, Barry. Your snake has a mild cold.
Who sold you this COBRA plan?
I am referring you to a specialist, don’t worry, he’s a real charmer.
The most puzzling question, Sir, is how you took your shirt off!”
Ah, I see you brought your insurance company with you.
Oddly enough, COBRA does not cover cobra.
As your vet, I think the first thing to do is remove that man who's stuck in the middle of you
So - what seems to be the problem?
So no frog in the throat anymore
Well...your cholesterol is fine.
You say you caught it on a plane?
I'm sorry, your insurance only covers bites, not constrictions.
Any other symptoms?
Here is a prescription for 25 mice.  We'll see if that helps.
You're lucky - I squeezed you in today.
So, what brings you to my office?
Any difficulty swallowing?
Why don't you take a week off work and go and unwind somewhere?
Is anything else bothering you ?
Unfortunately our herpetologists are all out of network.
I told you I accepted Cobra, not Boa.
Let's start with why you don't have any clothes on.
So he's having trouble swallowing?
In the future I suggest you avoid apples, gardens and naked women.
You got something that's going around.
And...it might be a good idea for Eve to come in also.
What’s the nature of your visit?
I need you to take off your boa.
Unfortunately, that one's not on my list of emotional support animals.
So, have you been out of the country in the last six months?
What can I do for you?
So the tests all came back positive. It is a snake.
I’m prescribing an anti strangulant.
Ok, so there's a few questions that I'll need to ask as you're a new patient.
Do you smoke?
I think you need to unwind a bit.
You're not covered, but the snake is - Trump Care.
I’m going to prescribe something to help you unwind.
Chest tightness, shortness of breath, feeling of impending doom...I think you’re having a panic attack.
Your legs look healthy.
And what else did the internet say about curing your sore throat?
I stand corrected. You should feed Larry more than once a year.
No, I will not certify him as an emotional support snake"
The good news is that we can rule out Lyme disease.
I’m going to write a prescription for Viagra which should straighten this whole thing out.
Your insurance company says this is a preexisting condition.
Well, the good news is we were able to remove the mole.”
No, there's little hope now. 
 I'd recommend just getting the boots to match.
It’ll clear up with anti-hiss-tamines.
The X-rays show you have a human stuck in your coils.
Now, what seems to be the problem here?
I'm writing you a prescription to unwind.
I highly doubt it's contagious.
Just one more question...how did you get that shirt off?
Take two rats, call me in the morning.
And this is why you don't trust ads from the internet.
It's a Catch-22. I can't treat you until you sign a waiver.
So Adam, What seems to be the problem?
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.  Tell me what brings you here today?
Sounds like a panic attack, but let me take a look at you.
He seems a bit lonely and depressed.  Give him 2 of these a day to unwind.
Any known allergy to mongooses, Mr. Jones?
I see the problem now, you can put your shirt back on.
I wouldn't worry about it, it seems to be going around.
And is Eve your ex-wife?
And why did you come in today?
Well... I have your test results and it's definitely Irritable Boa Syndrome.
This is the one condition where snake oil really does work.
I’m prescribing an anti-hssstamine.
Will you need a note for work?
Any noticeable changes to your reptile dysfunction
I think Alfred is fine, but I'm going prescribe him something for his separation anxiety.
I'm sorry, but your COBRA policy does not cover large boa constriction.
Shortness of breath is the most common side effect, but others experience constipation, skin irritation, and abject terror
Tightness in the chest. Anything else?
No, the Xanax is to help the snake to relax, not you.
Have you recently traveled out of the country?
Tell me again why you’re here.
So Howard, what brings you in today?
I'm going to give you something to help you unwind.
I say we just keep an eye on it and see if it gets any worse.
Can you sit up without your support animal?
Not to worry.  I only use it for monitoring blood pressure, not for performing the actual colonoscopy.
It is ironic. Nevertheless, the condition is not covered while on COBRA insurance.
You’ll find that a vasoconstrictor works much better.
I never thought I'd say this, but I think a bottle of snake oil might do the trick.
So, a little tightness. Where?
I still have to check your prostate.
Let's see, trouble breathing, tightness in the chest. Is that all?
For insurance purposes Iam just going to write tightness in chest.
I can prescribe something for your high blood pressure, or, you can get rid of the snake.
You can put your shirt on now.
Seems you tried to see a doctor outside your network.
Glad I could squeeze you in today.
Which one of you am I seeing first?
And where was Eve when this happened?
At the present time I'm less concerned about your flu symptoms than I am
the whereabout of my resident assistant.
So...I don't think it's anything internal.
Your insurance says it looks like a pre-existing condition.
I say there's nothing wrong here, but I'm just your vet.
Give him one of these in the evening to help him unwind.
Okay, and what seems to be the problem today?
I'll prescribe an antiboatic.
Yeah, this is probably the main drawback of the emotional-support snake.
So what seems to be the trouble?
You say you think you picked this up on a plane?
Here is a prescription for a big mongoose.
Your comfort snake is anxious. Try getting him a dog.
And the prescription for Xanax will help you unwind.
Of course an MRI will be more conclusive.
Perhaps we might consider a more appropriate support animal for you.
Well, it's not worms.
Our tests indicate that you may have picked up a parasite in the Amazon.
So what's the problem, sir?
It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, John. A lot of men have problems with their snakes.
We'll have to run more tests to be sure.
Sorry...undress means removing your boa too...
Does it rattle when you pee?
Have you traveled outside the country within the last two weeks?
I'm just going to have to disagree with WebMD on this one.  It isn't cancer.
I guess "cough twice" is out of the question.
We don't accept your coverage. Don't you have a COBRA?
Now I understand the need to squeeze you in.
I think you misunderstood when I suggested COBRA coverage!
Yes Doctor I am still insured under Cobra
Have you traveled outside the United States within the last 6 months?
Maybe we skip the colonoscopy today.
Have you traveled out of the country in the last three weeks?
Sorry for the wait...  I’m having trouble finding the right medical billing code.
We'll have to run some tests.
That frog in your throat has led to other complications.
I need you to remove the snake and put on that gown.
I thought you said BOWEL constriction.
Any shortness of breath?
Any other symptoms beyond shortness of breath?
Good news!  I think we can save the snake.
Well Mr. Jones, you say you are experiencing tightness in the chest. As you may know, that has many causes. Let’s get a CT, MRI,EKG, sonogram, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, cardiac cath, some blood work and we’ll get to the bottom of this.
I'm going to prescribe some Xanax for your friend. That should help her unwind.
Bill, I'm afraid this'll be a little trickier than the mole on you back last year.
Good news,its not your heart.
After I was fired, I elected to be covered by COBRA
Question eight. Any family history of reptile constriction?
Anything else?
No, it's fine. A lot of my patients bring their comfort animals.
You’re lucky I went to medical school in the Caribbean.
No, that's normal for boas. But if she still hasn't eaten anything by Monday, bring her back for another appointment.
And finally, would you say you feel safe at home?
I suggest you find a new way to unwind.
But could you play the violin before?
On your intake form you checked, "difficulty breathing;" Are you a smoker?
I can remove it, but I hate to tell you boa constrictors are not covered under your current COBRA insurance plan.
Other than trouble taking a deep breath, no complaints?
Wear it for three days and your constipation will be gone.
Coils!  My nurse thought you said boils
You can get a second opinion if you want, but you really need to have that thing removed.
And your health insurance is a ... Cobra plan?
COBRA plans aren't what they used to be.
You're going to have to speak up.
Have you recently traveled outside of the United States?
I’ve seen bigger.
We think our new Stress Test is far more affordable and accurate but yes, we’ve had complaints.”
I don't see how medicinal marijuana is going to improve this specific situation....
I'm afraid your H.R. Department doesn't quite understand the COBRA concept.
Dr. Scott is the best herpetologist I know, and he's a real charmer, too.
So, Adam, I'm guessing you ate the apple.
So how is COBRA working out for you?
In this case, snake oil is exactly what you need.
Well, the good news is I can explain the breathing problems and sudden weight gain...
Any dryness, itching or shedding of skin?
You gotta unwind.
This requires an injection. 
Would you like it in your arm or your asp?
Blame your HMO, it's the only gastric band they'll pay for.
I'm a little concerned about your blood pressure.
I'm afraid my recommendation will depend on which one of you has better insurance.
You've certainly gone to great lengths to avoid your prostate exam.
Good news! I found a herpetologist in your provider network.
I'm sorry, but we cannot not allow your emotional support animal to be with you during the colonoscopy.
So you'd just bitten into the apple?
I'm referring you to Dr. Mortenson.  She's quite the charmer.
Any numbness or tingling in lower extremities?
Sorry, you only have COBRA coverage.
Look, you keep telling me about the snake but let’s take a moment to talk about your high cholesterol.
I also recommend you stay away from apples and sin.
How was your vacation?
Tightening of the chest, shortness of breath...I know you are being attacked by a snake, but the insurance company says you are having a heart attack so that is what I have to treat you for.
Offhand, I'd say you're not actually paranoid.
Shortness of breath. Tightness in the stomach. Anything else?
So, when did the contractions start?
and insurance ... okay, I see you're still covered by COBRA
You were better off when you were covered under COBRA.
We are done. Get dressed and get your asp out of here.
I presume you want a note for your emotional support snake.
Let's see, crushing chest pain, Right?
It’s a traditional Chinese folk remedy for treating constipation.
Finally, a  contraceptive coil  that's fool proof.
Any concerns today other than feeling constricted?
Have you offered it a cow?
The good news is, you don't have worms.
So I'm going to put down 'emotional support animal'.
Your insurance will only cover this if you become unable to breathe.
I'm hearing a slight rattle.
Oh,him? He's just here to check your prostate.
It says here on your chart that you’re his main squeeze.
So I'm prescribing a muscle relaxant for his separation anxiety....
You just need to go home and unwind.
Springtime in the everglades, my busiest time of the year.
I am sorry but there just isn't anything we can do for the common coiled.
I can prescribe a muscle relaxant, but you have to figure out how to give it to the snake.
Would you describe the chest pain as sharp, dull or more of a constriction?
The bad news is she'll probably swallow you whole. The good news is you'll be part of the marvelous cycle of life.
Not a wise choice for a halloween contest, was it?
I'll write him a little something for separation anxiety.
So, tell me what's eating you today.
Other than that you're pretty healthy.
Your emotional-support animal needs to come off too.
I have a pretty good idea of what's going on but first I'm going to order a few tests.
I’m going to have to refer you to a veterinarian.
You look tense, I'll give you a few minutes to unwind.
This perscription will help you unwind.
Any travel abroad recently?
The good news is it's not ringworm.
Any recent lifestyle changes?
First, tell me how you were able to remove your clothes!
I'm prescribing a new pet.
Studies show that it is an extremely effective treatment for constipation
Don't tell me, you bought it on Amazon.
I’m going to prescribe you adder-all
Well, I think his tenure as an emotional support animal is pretty much over.
I’m prescribing some snake oil to loosen that up.
You say your wife's name is Eve?
Otherwise, how was your trip to the Everglades?
Have you been under a lot of pressure lately?
Well, all our tests are negative. But tell me again why you brought this man with you?
Your cholesterol and blood sugar look fine. Its the venom levels that concern me.
Well, the contractions are three minutes apart and dilation has begun, but unfortunately you’re in breech position, Mr. Coyle.
How can I examine this snake with you in there?
The good news is, there's nothing medically wrong with you.
So have you travelled outside the United States in the last 30 days?
Give her two rabbits and call me in the morning.
So when did you first start noticing this?
I don't know what to tell you doc, it just started with a frog in my throat.
Have you been out of the country in the last month?
You said you were ok with a generic vasoconstrictor.
If this doesn’t work, we’ll try the oil.
I think we know what this is but I'll need to run a few more tests to be sure.
"Shortness of breath can be caused by many things.
Please slip out of your boa and put on the robe. Then we can begin your exam.
I see you still have your COBRA benefits, everything else the same?
So, hissing sounds, tightness in the chest. Anything else?
So, you’re experiencing some tightness in your chest?  Let me run a few tests and see if I can figure out what’s going on.
There’s no magic pill. You just need to unwind.
He needs to cut down on mice, but otherwise he's fine.
have you traveled out of the country recently?
You're lucky that we were able to squeeze you in.
You have to find a different emotional support animal.
The good news is that the tightness you feel is not because of a heart attack.
I thought you selected the COBRA plan with full coverage.
I'm sorry.  Your COBRA plan doesn't over pythons.
The good news is your ECG is fine. That's not what's causing the tightness in your chest
As a last resort we could try to remove it.
Do you have cobra insurance?
You wouldn’t believe the day I’m having.
Feed it two good-sized rodents and call me in the morning.
On the plus side, it's the only thing holding you together.
No, I'm sure you won't need another appointment.
The good news? The tightness in your chest has nothing to with your heart.”
So Mr. Peterson what seems to be the problem?
I'm referring you to a herpetologist, but she's out of network."
So what seems to be the matter here?
It’s an intestinanal disorder. The good news is that it’s not yours.
What’s eating you?
So, how's Eve?
It’s going to be tricky to find you an in-network mongoose.
Unfortunately, that snake has you better covered than your health insurance.
It appears that your pet is suffering from separation anxiety.
Prunes will do the job and are less restrictive.
I hear it’s going around.
This will work like a charmer.
The good news is it’s temporary, the bad news is I’m talking to the snake.
Let me know if that gets too tight.
Present this note at the gate and you shouldn't have any issues flying with your emotional support animal.
So, a tightening in your chest.  Any other symptoms?
Once I uncoil it, you should find it easier to walk, sleep, shower, and definitely to make new friends.
Your blood pressure isn’t where I’d like it to be.
Current address still: Eden, Garden of? Emergency contact: Eve?
Are you under a lot of pressure?
They didn't kick you off the plane because of your emotional support python. They kicked you off because you weren't wearing pants.
The xrays revealed that you have a snake wrapped around you.
Clarence, we've discussed this before, humans are bad for your cholesterol
And how do you feel about Eve now, Adam?
I'm going to recommend Boa-tox.
Ok, can you breathe in for me?
With your insurance, we can get a snake charmer in next Tuesday.
You think you feel squeezed now, wait 'til you see my bill.
I think you need a chance to unwind.
Your insurance only covers snakes under ten feet long.
My assistant there is just taking your blood pressure.
Well, some more bad news. You also have a tape worm.
I’m prescribing Valium for you and cyanide for your friend. Be careful not to mix them up.
The good news is, your prostate is fine.
The good news is that it's not a tapeworm.
So I guess we should reschedule that colonoscopy?
It's probably nothing, but we can run some tests.
So your first name is Monty?
So, what about "Don't Tread on Me" did you not understand?
Last question. Have you been to any exotic locations during the past three months?
So what’s the reason for the visit?
You may have a large snake wrapped around you, but we'll need to run some tests.
I see you've met the drug rep.
One mouse a day at 4 P.M.
The good news is, it's not asthma.
OK...other than that anything else...?
Your's is the first case this season."
I've seen dozens of patients come in with monkeys on their backs, but this is a first.
Actually, you are fine...except for the snake.
Have you travelled outside of the US in the past month?
It might not be a panic attack after all.
And how frequent are the constrictions?
i’m writing a prescription that should help you unwind
Does it hurt when you laugh?
Would you say it’s pain or just pressure?
This will help you unwind.
That reminds me, Mr. Johnson, you're due for a colonoscopy.
Slightly constricted or very constricted?
Any change since the last check-up?
If the snake doesn’t spark joy, I suggest getting rid of it.
'C'mon Mr. Franklin.  Clothes off means everything.'
I'm sorry sir, but this procedure isn't covered by your COBRA plan.
Other than that, would you rate your overall health as excellent, good, or fair?
Sigh* What ELSE did the internet say you should do?
Take two mice and call me in the morning.
Look, I'll do some tests but I'm pretty sure you've got a snake wrapped around your neck.
How would you describe your pain? With 1 being no pain, and 10 being crushed by a boa constrictor.
Feed it two rabbits and call me in the morning.
I’m sorry I couldn’t squeeze you in earlier.
I need you to take everything off, Mr Cooper please.
Have you traveled outside of the country in the last 30 days?
We received the test results and I think I finally know what the problem is
So, Mr. Clark, what brings you in today?
Point to where it hurts.
And for your legs, I’ll prescribe pressure socks with garters.
I see, any other complaints?
Looks like you picked something up.
I had to Google this one.
That tight feeling around your chest... I think I know what it is.
Insurance is denying your claim, as only they have the legal right to squeeze you.
Chuck, what you've got is going around.
You might have picked something up while visiting Brazil.
So you have a few questions about your COBRA?
Any chest pain, tightness, or difficulty breathing?
I'm prescribing a fairly aggressive muscle relaxant first. And then, charm school.
No,she seems pretty healthy, but you were wise to bring her in regardless.
What brought you in today?
Our blood pressure machine is out of order, so we are using him.
They’re just having some fun with you at the gastroenterology clinic. This isn’t the colonoscopy snake.
Take the decongestant pills for 2 weeks. If your breathing doesn't improve, I'd get rid of the snake.
Don't worry, he's just taking your blood pressure.
The test results suggest you may be a carrier of some kind of tropical pest.
First, the good news. Your chest pain isn't a heart attack.
HOW DID YOU GET YOUR JACKET OFF?
Your high blood pressure appears to be stress related.  I suggest you try to unwind.
Again?"
The good news is that you should be able to digest the human over the next few days
Go get two Mongooses and call me in the morning.
Please tell me the reason for your visit to the clinic today.
Well, let's start with this.  Have you been out of the country recently?
So, what exactly has brought you into the clinic today?
Before I examine your throat, Mr. Jones, I'm gonna have to ask you to remove your boa.
Feed it two white mice and call me in the morning.
I said "restrictive diet" not "constrictive diet"
Technically yes, it does make you look fat.
And where is Eve?
Certainly, the snake is one possible explanation​ for your shortness of breath.  However, I make a lot more money if we run a series of unnecessary tests.
Everything looks good. I'll see you in a year.
Now which one of you two am I seeing today?
Not to worry. This happens occasionally with people who opt for COBRA medical coverage.
It's just a little something to help you unwind.
I misunderstood when you told me you liked to wear your wife's boa.
This is a more naturopathic approach for those with severe constipation.
I'm not sure if it's a boa or a python.  I'm going to go ahead and send you to a herpetologist.
This is completely normal. My last patient's emotional support alligator was clingy too.
Anything else besides shortness of breath?
I'm going to have to ask you to turn your cellphone off.
On the bright side, this delays your prostate exam.
It's really up to you Mr. Smith.  Is this something you can live with or do you want to see a specialist?
The good news is you’re not in danger. The bad news is you’re endangered.
A compression bandage would have worked just as well.
...And last week it was from the jaws of a lion. Tell me, has the Great Zordini ever considered a change of career?
So, what happened to Eve?
That human will have to be removed Mr. Snake.
Yes, your scarf too.
Maybe you're not as charming as you think.
Routine question,we ask everybody ... do you feel safe at home?
Yes, tightness in the chest is a symptom of a heart attack, but it could be something else entirely.
Your penile enlargement procedure with snake stem cells went extremely well, now we just have to do little trimming
I'n prescribing a muscle relaxant for both of you.
Next I am prescribing compression leggings.
You can put your pants back on now.
Looks like a serious case of full-monty python
So, what do you do to unwind?
Which garden were you in?
Good news, bad news- You have high blood pressure, but we think we know the cause.
I'm putting you on a boa blocker.
At this point, it's not the cancer I would worry about.
Unfortunately, your insurance doesn't cover snake coil.
So, any unusual symptoms?
I'm still not sure how this happened but, we're going to get that human out right away
No, actually my chart says vapor rub.
I am writing you a prescription to help with the contractions.
So, shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping and range of motion restrictions in the arms and shoulders; we'll need to run some tests.
Sorry you're not covered under COBRA.
Can you let go of your human now,so I can examine you?
When I said, "Get it on Amazon" I meant the website
If it gets any bigger, let us know.
Let's see if an MRI shows us anything.
Soooo . . .  a general tightness in the chest?
Any trouble eating, sleeping, peeing, bowel movements, or sex?
This should help you unwind.
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU.
This do-it-yourself gastric band seems to be working for you. You've lost another 50 pounds.
So, would you describe the pain as "dull," "aching," "shooting," or "crushing"?
Unfortunately veterinarians are out of network for you
Well, it could explain that feeling of tightness in your chest.
Well right off the bat, I think we'll rule out bronchitis and pneumonia
Instagram or Snapchat?
Now, which of you is the patient?
Let's try a different comfort animal "
Separate bills?
Great news, your lab reports show you're in excellent health.
Don't worry.  It's going around.
The problem is that seems to be a python and, the thing of it is, we only accept COBRA.
OK, but no discomfort in the lower legs, is that right?
We don't have a code for boa constrictor--let's just call it chest pain
Any symptoms other than chest pains?
Have you traveled outside the United States in the last six months?
So, what’s been eating you?
And you're Monty, I take it?
In cases like this I often recommend snake oil.
I thought when you called you said you had ebola.
I see you've met Caduceus, our new comfort animal. Do me a favor and don't exhale until I get an orderly in here
I'm putting you on a boa constricted diet.
\unfortunately, all the tests indicate that he’s hungry.
I’d say its a Boa but it could be an Anaconda. Would you like a second opinion?
The good news is that it’s not a skin condition.
This isn't quite doing it.  I'm going to try you on Anaconda for a month.
Tightness in the chest... feelings of impending doom... I’ll have to run a few tests first, but, yes, it could be cardiac in nature.
What can I do for you today, Mr. Jones?
Everything seems to be perfectly normal, was there a specific reason for your visit today?
You are fine but the boa needs to unwind.
Besides that, how are you feeling in general?
You seem a little constricted.
If it's an adult anaconda it may be considered a pre-existing condition.
The bad news is, your snake has a cold.
Well, I think I know what's caused that tight feeling in your chest."
This new organic body cast will help realign your spine and it is environmentally friendly.
Just so you know, our veterinarian specialist is out of network.
And is it causing you any discomfort?
So how long have you had this shortness of breath?
Your insurance says they only cover snake bites.
I think we’ll skip the prostate exam today.
Sir, we cannot perform the operation until you sign the documents.
I’m very sorry, sir, but your insurance company doesn’t consider the removal medically necessary.
Look at it this way, most people are up to their neck in debt.
Maybe the insurance code for vasoconstriction is close enough
So, this is Eve's fault?
Can you describe the tightness in your chest?
Looks like he found you way too charming.
The good news is that the growth is benign
Your relationship isn’t toxic, but it is suffocating.
No sir, I don’t think it’s ringworm.
I can only say that your wife Eve told a different story.
We all agree. It's an Anaconda. Was there anything else?
Just learn to relax and unwind.
This is exactly why we recommend vaccinations.
And is that when you told Eve it was her fault?
I see that you marked “Yes” on  “Shortness of Breath”.
In a way I’m jealous because I could really use a hug.
I have your "emotional support animal" papers here, but sir, I still don't think you will be able to fly without clothing"
Rate your constriction on a scale of 1 to 10.
Trust me he's not covered under your COBRA plan.
Shortness of breath. Anything else?
This isn't even covered in Canada, unfortunately.
Try a feather boa next time.
For once, I don't think the problem is your anxiety.
If I were you, Mr. Morris, I'd choose a different emotional support animal.
You say you signed up for Cobra health?
Didn't the nurse ask you to take EVERYTHING off?
Unfortunately Mr. Monty, your health plan doesn’t cover Ereptile Dysfunction!
Feed him two rats and try to call me in the morning.
That's not what I meant when I said you should have 
COBRA  coverage."


Joan Black, Easton Connecticu
You’ll never believe it, but last week I had a guy come in with a monkey on his back.
Did't you also have a Poodle
First, the mole on your back is no longer a problem.
I don’t think I can treat this. It’s an endangered species.
Unfortunately, the nearest zoo is out-of-network.
We can help you with the Full Monty, but not the Python.
It's the high blood pressure that worries me
We won’t know for sure until we run some tests.
Here’s a prescription for snake oil, but you may not need it.
There was really no need to take off your pants.
You have Monty Python syndrome.
I'm glad to report we've ruled out asthma"
There is no good news. You have become his therapy animal.
Well you know what they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
This is the worst case of ring worm I've ever seen.
Look, everyone has excuses for high blood pressure, I’m still recommending lowering your sodium intake.
We're going to need to run some tests.
Were you dressed in something provacative?
These attachment disorders can be tricky.
It's a prescription for a mongoose.
I could prescribe a muscle relaxant,
for the snake of course.
Tightness in the chest could result from a number of causes.
I'm sorry to tell you, Mr. Johnson, but we can't do anything for you without a referral from your vet.
It’s not terminal. For the snake.
There’s definitely something going around.
Have you tried charming it?”
Any tightness in the chest?
The good news is your cholesterol looks great.
Next time, try not to tread on it.
Ah, I see you are being prepped for your colonoscopy.
Well at least it isn't a frog in the throat.
Any tightness in your chest?
Trust me, this is more effective than an enema.
Ha! Everyone's a doctor after they've googled their symptoms.
I've got some pills for that, but you might have a hard time swallowing them.
I suggest you unwind a bit, Mr. Smithers.
Well, the good news is it isn’t venomous.
So, Mr. Schmidt, what seems to be the problem?
Actually, I'm a vet--so you're not the patient here."
WebMD says it’s asthma.
Sorry, your HMO only covers anacondas.
I checked the computer. The results are negative. You are good to go.
I'm recommending that you switch to a feather boa.
Unfortunately, Mr. Haverford, that’s a python. Your healthcare provider only covers boas.
I see they squeezed you in
So you refused to eat the apple.
And you first noticed this when?
I'd like to run some tests to see what the problem is
Unfortunately, your insurance only covers domestic serpents.
Of course we’ll have to do some tests, but I have an idea what the problem might be
Good news, Mr Jones...all the tests came back negative."
You’re lucky I could squeeze you in.
Yes, an inability to touch one's toes is of some concern, but I don't think you're seeing the entire picture, Mr. Smith.
My diagnosis is that you have 3-6 minutes to live.
On the other hand, a squeezing feeling in the chest is often the first symptom of a heart attack.
Any wheezing or shortness of breath?
And you said you hear hissing in which ear?
Tightness in chest... do you smoke?
To lower your blood pressure, I’m prescribing a live goat.
On a positive note, he's bulimic.
Your insurance says you’re fine.
"GIVE HIM 2 RATS, 1 LIZARD AND 
CALL ME IN THE MORNING.
First, a few questions. What seems to be your problem?
It's a textbook emboalism.
I'm afraid you've got the Grippe
I think we'll give him something to help him relax a bit.
Maybe you should consider a different emotional support animal .
I am sure the nurse did mention, you can't bring your support animal to your colonoscopy
The next time you dress in drag Mr. Jones, Id try a feather boa.
You just left your job.  I guess it's safe to assume you have COBRA coverage.
You should've come in at "Oh, Gee! It's up to my knee."  "Oh, fiddle! It's up to my middle" is much harder to treat.
And would you say this tightness in your chest started before or after you came home from safari?'
So, how's the new zookeeper's job going?
Well, it’s been a year and he hasn’t eaten you yet.
Lab test results say it's a snake.
And how long have you had trouble swallowing?
Now that we've cured your fear of snakes, is there anything else we can help you with?
I'm prescribing a mongoose for your symptoms.
Take 2 aspirin and coil me in the morning.  Just kidding!
How long has this man been bothering you?
...and what can I help you with today?
Looks like I'm not the only one who squeezed you in today.
Other than that, how was the trip to the Amazon?
Take a mongoose and call me in the morning
This does seem to be going around.
The good news is the tightness in your chest has nothing to do with your heart.
Ereptile dysfunction is a psychological, not medical, condition.
There’s nothing to worry about.  It’s nonvenomous.
I'd suggest a lubricant. Snake oil should do the trick.
I’m ordering a PET scan to help diagnose the cause of your constriction
The good news is that I figured out why you have shortness of breath.
I think we've found the reason for your shortness of breath.
Okay, I'll certify Chester as a comfort animal. But I still don't think they will allow a snake on a plane.
I’m going need you to cough.
So you say you're feeling a little pressure?
So, for your first drag queen appearance, when they said, “Wear a boa” they meant a feathery, long scarf.
I'm going to prescribe some snake oil, which should loosen it right up.
GIVE THE SNAKE A SHOT OF WHISKEY TO UNWIND
Don't be modest, take off the snake.
I said erectile not reptile!
You'll need to remove the snake,too.
So, besides a little tightness in your chest, any other symptoms?
Would you say it's more of a sharp pain or a dull ache?
Next of Kin: Eve
Actually, I WOULD recommend snake oil.
It's time to reassess: is this particular emotional support animal giving you more than it takes out of you?
You're in very good health Mr. President.
You need to give up wearing boas, they're too constricting.
Any coughing, wheezing or tightening of the chest?
The good news is, your scoliosis has cleared up.
Let’s try two dead rats and call me in the morning.
If it's not bothering you we won't do anything right now.
As your vet, I must say everything looks fine.
This should keep the swelling down for now.
You think you’re being squeezed, let me tell you about malpractice insurance.
They've a good python man at Special Surgery, but the earliest I can get you in is next week.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't think you'll need a follow-up appointment.
So, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest and you're generally feeling constricted.
The good news is, it’s not a tumor”
Everything looks good..Though I am a bit concerned 
about your blood pressure.
Well, we'll need some snake oil to get you out of this.
Don't shoot the messenger, you won't believe the things your HMO excludes.
I'm going to prescribe an antidepressant to help you unwind.
Well, a tightness around the chest doesn't always mean that you will die from a heart attack.
This certainly could be the reason you’re constipated.
So, we’ll skip the rectal exam today.
Lucky for you, this is the only affliction Snake Oil cures.
Have you travelled outside the US recently?
This should get rid of that frog in your throat.
Three to five medium-sized rodents a day for Monty,
Don't miss a feeding, you should be fine.
Two more weeks of this and we’ll hit your goal weight.
On the other hand, this might help your constipation issues.
The good news is it’s not poisonous.
Sorry. The pharmacy keeps misreading my prescriptions.
So, looks like you’re no longer on cobra.
Look, I’m a hepatologists, and your liver looks in really good shape. You need a herpetologist for that other thing.
It's time for you to unwind.
First of all, we need to remove that mouse tattoo from your chest.
By any chance, were you recently on a plane?
I am going to give you something to unwind.
Have you been under any pressure lately?
I'm afraid this will be out-of-pocket for you.  Your insurance doesn't cover pre-existing constrictions.
Are you still with Eve?
Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
This is our new intern - he’ll be taking your blood pressure.
And just when did these contractions begin?
For insurance purposes, I'm going to call this a major constriction.
If possible, I'd like the $20 co-pay now.
Shortness of breath. Anything else bothering you?
Well, going out on a limb here, that tightness in your chest might not be bronchitis
Still single?
An aspirins for you. A muscle relaxer for her.
Have you traveled outside the country recently?
...on the other hand Brad, it looks like your constipation is no longer a problem.
You felt fine when you got on the plane. Then what?
I’m putting you on a constricted diet.
I'm thinking this concludes our little experiment with homeopathy.
I'm not judging you but if you're naked under there tell me now.
Let's not jump to any conclusions until we can run some tests.
Okay, trouble breathing. Any other symptoms?
This shortness of breath; is it new?
...and his name is Monty, you say?
As a veterinarian, my first concern is for the snake.
The good news is that it looks like he already had lunch.
I'm going to back off on the vasoconstrictor medication.
I'm afraid our options are somewhat constricted.
So, how long have you been hearing this hissing sound?
Have your traveled outside the continental United States in the last twenty one days?
I think you'll find that when we get this removed, a colonoscopy won't seem so bad.
I’m afraid your insurance only covers animal bites. Let’s just wait a while and see what happens.
I'm afraid the emotional support snake will have to come off as well.
I do admit...It's an old method of curing constipation!
You were cutting the grass, and then what happened?
Cough.
One prescription for an Emotional Support mongoose.
Difficulty breathing can have any number of causes.
I won't be able to look at that neck of yours unless you take off your boa.
Good news.  You're not having a heart attack.
It’s psychosomatic. You just need to unwind.
I want you to take two mongooses and call me in the morning.
I’m going to refer both of us to a psychiatrist.
This is the noninvasive lap band alternative we discussed....
So at first she was just wrapped around your little finger?
Before he squeezes the life out of you, please finish filling out your insurance information.
Are you her main squeeze?
Well, that about wraps it up
Any changes since your last visit?
I suggest an elimination diet. Let’s start with Apples.
So, what seems to be the matter?
Would you say she's your main squeeze?
Nothing too alarming here. You just caught what is going around.
Any symptoms other than the tightness in your chest?
I still don't quite get how it ate your pants.
Your stool sample confirms, it's coilitis.
So you're telling me you can't sleep because of a hissing noise?
I'm optimistic.  Last week you said 'oh, gee, it's up to my knee,' and I'm not hearing any knee complaints today.
What do you mean, 'I think I came home with something from Africa?'
And then what happened?
You still have to bend over.
Now Cough
Well, the good news is that it isn’t cancer...
We need to do a hisssterectomy.
Dr. Oz is wrong about this, too.
A couple of mice a day and your constriction should go away
Oddly enough, I prescribe snake oil in cases like yours.
Any tightness in the chest? difficulty breathing...?
Side effects may include shortness of breath
Any tightness around your chest area?
No, it's not a tapeworm...
Yeah, this has been going around.
In my professional opinion, a weighted blanket would be just as effective and have fewer side effects.
When did you start feeling short of breath?
Congratulations! It’s a boa.
You seem rattled, Fred.
Any chest pains, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath?
Do you need a minute to unwind?
Compression sock... Is my handwriting that bad?
Physically, he's fine.
I said a RE-stricted diet.
I’m prescribing snake oil
I know you don't like taking medication but I'm going to give you something to help you unwind.
I'm cancelling your appointment for next week.
It may feel uncomfortable at first, but we're committed to this new natural way of taking blood pressure.
Blood pressure is high - but understandable.
Ok, I'll give you credit for creativity. But this is the last time I'll refill your painkillers.
We just need to squeeze one more urine sample out of you and then we'll be done.
I'm only a student but chest pressure, shortness of breath, anxiety   sounds like a panic attack to me.
You marked "Constricted Airway" on your intake form. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
Constricted breath, difficulty exercising, sudden hissing. My diagnosis is asthma.
The x-ray is showing a multitude of broken bones but honestly I’d take the fact that he hasn’t eaten yet you as a win.
Well, technically, it is a pre-existing condition...
Yeah, that's the problem with our new hospital gowns. Everybody sees your asp.
You’re fine, but the snake has a hernia.
...and avoid eating apples.
Generally when they wrap themselves around you like this, it's something other than a show of affection.
You better see a pythologist about this."
Any tightening in the chest?
I have a hunch about your shortness of breath, but your insurance company requires more tests.
We're gonna need insurance pre-authorzation for an anacondectomy...
Perhaps you should consider a different comfort pet.
Any trouble breathing prior to getting the snake?
Sorry but i can’t find a billing code for this...
Let me guess, it's after the frog in your throat.
I can remove it but it's not covered under your insurance
If you relax, he’ll relax.  Have you tried meditation?
A constriction?  Can you be more specific?
I'm going give you something that will help you unwind.
Okay sir, the chart says you are 46 years old, currently employed as a civil serpent..sorry, servant.
So this is your comfort animal?
Sorry, but you only get COBRA coverage if you've lost your job.
It’s nothing serious. Just try to unwind a bit.
This particular snake is on the endangered species list, so you are just going to have to learn to live with it.
Are you a smoker?
The good news is that you should feel some constriction for a few more minutes, but then you won't feel anything.
Other than difficulty breathing, any symptoms?
Well, next time, accept the apple...
Your blood work looks fine, however there appears to be a circulation problem.
No, in fact, some snake oil is exactly what you need.
It's our new way to collect co-pays.
That was quite a trick, getting your shirt off.
I believe a dog would be a better comfort animal.
Any tightness in your chest or difficulty breathing"
""On a positive note, you'll get a very nice set of luggage out of this."
You might have to go out of network.
I'd like to run a few more tests before making a diagnosis.
Blood pressure is a little high, otherwise I’d say you’re good to go
Hi, so I’d first like to get to know you a bit, then we can talk about why you’re here today.
So you weren't lying when you told me about your 'ereptile' dysfunction.
Looks like you caught something during your recent trip to the Amazon Rain Forest
I'm going to need you to get undressed.
Take off the snake and the doctor will be right in.
Other than shortness of breath, have you experienced any other symptoms?
It's quite slow moving, so come back in a month and we'll see how its progressed.
We were able to squeeze you in. Now what's the problem?
Uh-huh, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing . . . anything else?
We'll give you some Advil for the chest pain, and some mice for the snake"
You need to unwind a bit.
I'll write you a prescription for an antiboatic.
I am prescribing myself an anti-psychotic as I appear to be having an hallucination.
It's a tropical thing that's going around.
And, you say you’re having trouble breathing, correct?
This seems to be a case of bowel constrictor.
Just when did you begin to feel this tightness in your chest?
When did you start feeling this tightness in your chest?
Any tightness, heavy pressure, or squeezing around chest area?
I notice your blood pressure is a bit high.
Now just relax while Mr. Slinky takes your blood pressure.
You're covered but I'm afraid the snake is out of network.
So what’s wrong with Gladys besides being a bit clingy today?
I don't want you to be rattled.
I told you, everything off except your underwear
Take two a day for you reptile disfunction.
Restricted movement. Any other symptoms?
Have him take two rodents, every four hours, then call me in the morning.
The good news is that your chest pain isn’t casused by a heart attack.
You say you feel a tightness in your chest?
And when did you get into Monty Python?
I guess we can eliminate family history.
You appear to be constricted.
So how long has your python had this separation anxiety disorder?
Charming.
I take it the snake oil isn't helping?
According to Amazon, when you ordered, you neglected to check the box labeled 'feather.'
Honestly Bill, aren't you getting a little too defensive about having your prostate examined?
I won't know what's causing your chest pain until I order some lab work.
One Mongoose, at breakfast, as needed.
Now, do you smoke?
Well sir, I have some crushing news.
I guess you're not as charming as you thought you were.
The snake is overweight, but everything else is normal.
If you want to fly, you'll  have to get a different support animal.
Shouldn't we really be talking about the elephant in the room?
It’s funny, but this us not covered by your COBRA  insurance!
Spanx are easier.
Twenty minutes every day at bedtime.  But don't sleep with it on.
Besides that, is everything else normal?
I’m going to write you a referral to my vet as well.
Roger, your pressure is up
OK...Tightness in your chest.  Have you been exercising?  How about alcohol consumption?  Getting enough sleep?  Problems at home or at work?
So you're feeling constricted?
I really won't know until I get the lab results back.
Compression stockings should take care of those cold feet.
I'll be giving you a letter that should allow you to fly with the support boa.
How long have you have you had this feeling of tightness in your chest?
So you're experiencing some tightness around the chest.
We found no one liked the blood pressure cuff.
yup...typical case of Ereptile Dysfunction
I'm worried about those feet of yours.   They may not be getting proper blood circulation.
Shortness of breath can mean any number of things.
It's probably benign, but there's a small chance it could lead to the Fall of Man.
Any other pressing problems?
This prescription should help with the hissing.
Just checking.  When was the last time you fed him?
I'm prescribing a mild sedative for your pet python's separation anxiety.
I recommend that you switch to a feather boa.
Could be the anaconda. Could be any number of things. Let's the what the lab results have to say.
I remember when The New Yorker cartoons were funny.
I wasn’t able to listen to your lungs, but you show signs of constricted breathing.
Let's have you try the extended release capsule.
So tell me, when did you first notice the constriction"
It won't relieve your back pain, but it will take your mind off of it.
As for your pet mouse, I don't think we'll be able to save her.
You say you’re feeling short of breath. Any other symptoms?
I can't up your dose anymore. 
THIS IS our strongest emotional support pet.
It's surprisingly good at detecting high blood pressure, and no one can pronounce sphygmomanometer anyway.
I don't like the look of these blood pressure numbers.
Your blood pressure is high.  Any pressing concerns?
Heart palpitations are normal for a man with your condition
It's not as rare as people think.
Ironic that using a Python for constipation is covered by your COBRA plan.
We had so many complaints about the paper gowns that open in the back that we decided to try this.
And how much do you weigh without the snake?
Snake oil is snake oil, whether you buy it bottled or harvest it yourself.
I'm sorry. Your insurance considers this a pre-existing condition.
Sorry, but with your insurance this is the only pet scan they will pay for
Take two of these at bedtime, and try not to look delicious.
OK... Don’t take a deep breath.
Tight chest and difficulty breathing... Could be asthma...
I have some snake oil that may actually work in this case.
Anything more specific than 'shortness of breath'?
Well, your blood pressure seems OK; now if you hop down, I'll have him take your temperature.
Besides the tightness in your chest do you have any other complaints?
...or is it: “FEED a cold, and STARVE a snake...?”
We don’t see this side effect very often.
So,what’s the problem.
It says here you're been feeling a bit constricted. I'm thinking it's probably the snake, but going to have to run some more tests just to be sure.
It appears you caught this on your recent trip to the Amazon rain forest
What do you suppose is triggering your anxiety this time?
Ok. So everything looks fine. I'll see you next year.
So it says here, you’re suffering from shortness of breath. Would you say that is something recent?
Thanks for squeezing me in Doc.
If we aren’t seeing results by next month another option could be the lap-band.
So on a scale of one to ten...
As you make payments towards my bill, we will replace him with progressively smaller snakes.
Mr. Jones, I'm a hematologist, and what you really need to see is a  herpetologist."
My apologies.  It seems that 'topical anesthesia' was auto-corrected to 'tropical anaconda'...
I prescribed snake OIL, not snake COIL
What does Eve say?
You're right; there IS a lot of it going around.
The good news is the snake is doing very well
If I can just get you to sign this insurance form, we’ll have a look at you.
Now, I've got to ask this : have you been travelling ?
At any time in the last four weeks have you felt depressed, anxious or hopeless?
Feeling any tightness in your chest?
Alternative therapies can sometimes come back to bite you.
Well, you consented to the use of unorthodox methods, and according to my clinical experience, this is guaranteed to help you quit smoking cigarettes...
Shortness of breath? Any other symptoms I should know about?
But the good news is...keep him properly fed, and you’re in no immediate danger
Well, it’s good we managed to squeeze you in today.
I’m sorry sir, we still have to perform a prostate exam. Standard procedure.
No, I don't think it's just a panic attack.
This time I'm writing you a prescription for a service dog.
So...it says here you feel a tightness in your chest?
Tightness in your chest, can be a symptom of a more serious condition.
I'm prescribing you change from Cobra to Aetna for better coverage.
I'm afraid your boa is constricted.
Any history of python strangulation in your family?
So, when did you first start
 feeling a tightness around your chest, Mr Green?
So you say your symptoms are shortness of breath, loss of mobility and trouble sleeping?
So, does it really feel like a constriction, or is it more a sharp radiating pain?
...and when did you notice the tightness in your chest?
Any other symptoms besides shortness of breath?
Next time try a turtle neck
Well, I most certainly can explain the crushing chest pain.
So how have your bowel movements been?
Like I told you Monty, you can't bring your human to the vet.
Scales don't lie...
You'll have to uncoil your emotional support animal 
so we can proceed.
I'm afraid all things point to Monty Python Disease.
So, what seems to be your problem?
And why have you come in today?
The compression socks just didn't seem to be working.
It's never the obvious reason. Let's run a few tests to see why you're short of breath.
I see you're already familiar with health insurers and the pharmaceutical industry.
Do you feel safe in your relationship?
So, tell me what brings you in today.
Any new sources of stress in your life?
And what is your primary complaint?
First the good news, you don't have a tape worm.
The pressure you feel in your chest is apparently not related to your heart.
I’m going to recommend a really good charmer.
Unfortunately you’re only covered if it actually bites you.
You know, there are more effective treatments for constipation.
It says here that you've been complaining about some tightness in your chest, correct?
You seem tense. Before we begin this examination, I want you to relax, unwind and tell me what's eating you.
I'm afraid you have the Full Python
Your insurance said if we can get the parasite inside your body, they'll cover it.
The good news is that it will let you go once mating season ends.  The bad news is that you are pregnant.
So this is what you meant when you said  you were constricted
We could play the good news / bad news game, but you really don't have a lot of time for that.
Let's start from the beginning. Do you have any allergies?
All your tests came back normal.
Is it more of a sharp or squeezing pain?
Coiliosis.
I’m going to write a prescription for a little something that will help you unwind.
I’m hoping this muscle relaxer will do the trick.
No, the epinephrine is for your anaphalaxisis- the rat is for the anaconda.
In time, you'll forget you even have a gastric band.
So, describe what you’re feeling right now.
You said it's 'slowly squeezing the life out of you'. Sounds like my ex.
I'm sorry.  You're not completely covered.
Amazon delivery?
So you’re trying to leave her because she’s smothering you?
So, is this your way of saying you're covered thru COBRA?
Not the best choice of therapy pet.
I’m prescribing something to unwind you.

It says here you’re experiencing a tightness in your chest.
Well, The good news is the tightness in your chest is not the result of a heart attack
Any trouble breathing?
Well, I'm a little concerned about your blood pressure.
So if I understand you correctly, you were wearing a Mickey Mouse t-shirt?
...and, other than the tightness in your chest?
Of all the side effects, cottonmouth is actually quite treatable.
Adderall is the name of the drug,not the dosage.
Well, at least you're not wrapped up in yourself anymore.
So for how long has this man been bothering you?
Sir, I had referred you to a "Hepatologist", not a "Herpetologist".
Are you still having hallucinations about being choked by a snake?
Now I can prescribe you meds but I think this is more of a lifestyle change.
Says here you’re having tightness in you’re chest?
Good news?  You look dashing in a boa. 
Bad news?  It will be hungry soon.”
Trust me. It’s herpes. I’m a herpetologist.
And how long have you been experiencing this shortness of breath?
I know men wear boas these days, but yours is a bit constricting, no?
It's better than the lap band.  After the first week, you won't mind the calorie restriction at all.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one getting squeezed by the new Medicare plans.
I think I can help you, but I'm afraid your friend has already been digested.
It says here you're complaining of shortness of breath?
Nice boa. First attempt at cross dressing?
Now you might feel a little squeeze.
Take two hampsters every four hours and call me in the morning.
It looks like we'll have to delay your colonoscopy.
Two rats a day, given orally, should gradually relieve that constricting sensation
Good news, the constriction you're experiencing in your chest is not heart-related
So...the snake needs a shot.
The prognosis gives you another three minutes.
Will your friend also be getting the flu shot today?
I'm writing you a prescription for mice.
So everything's fine aside from that?
You might experience some tightness when swallowing.
Has it been more than four hours?
Yes, tightness in the chest...what other symptoms?
So you say something you disagreed with is about to eat you?
Chest pressure yes, but I’m pretty sure it’s not a heart attack!
I might suggest a different emotional support animal for your stress.
You really need to find time to unwind
Would you mind filling out a short survey about your visit today?
We treat depression, not compression.
Don’t worry, you’ll shed it in 3-5 days.
I see here that you have a complaint of tightness in your chest?
I’ll just prescribe a little something to help you both relax.
Stop worrying. He's fine.
Why are you here ?
I'm going have to refer you to a herpetologist.
Any unhealthy attachments?
Good news - you're not dying from cancer!
Congrats on the new yacht, but next time I’d recommend disabling autocorrect before requesting another “boat contractor”.
Have you been out of the country during the last two weeks?"
It certainly accounts for your high blood pressure.
I’m sorry to inform you but you have a stage four snake.
Looks like your coverage is good.
Breathe normally
Your relationship with the snake ... symbiotic or adversarial?
Well, the good news, it's not COPD.
No exceptions. I need the insurance card first.
And then Eve just dropped the apple and ran.
'Good news.  Tests show that you don't have a tapeworm.'
So your tests are back and I think we know what's causing the elevated blood pressure.
Sorry, your Cobra doesn't cover boa.
So you say she’s having trouble swallowing?
It's working. You've lost 17 pounds !
Keep it wrapped two more days.
I'm going to prescribe two mice and check with you in the morning.
You can get dressed now.  I think I've discovered your problem.
So this   helps  with the constipation  problem?
I think you'll find a weighted blanket will serve the same purpose.
What is your chief complaint today?
A muscle relaxer should do the trick.
I suggested you go on a restrictive diet, not a constrictor diet.
Well we're out of rodents so let's give the clarinet a try.
You know, they can make these with feathers.
Let's start by testing your knee reflexes.
You're too wrapped up in your work.
I’m writing you a prescription for a feather boa.
Well, we've ruled out anything you've eaten
The tightness in your chest is just a minor panic attack... Perhaps due to the python.
Blink once if your experiencing any shortness of breath.
Personally, I'd rethink this whole therapy snake thing.
I’d advise against self-medicating again, so I’m prescribing a standard back brace for you, and a muscle-relaxant for your snake.
Take this asp. Print the prescription. Go home and unwind.
Your insurance won’t cover removal. The South American boa constrictor is out of network.
It doesn't matter--your COBRA coverage has still expired.
Mr. Johnson, based on all these tests, I feel the cause of your high blood pressure is stress.
No, it’s not a tapeworm. But it’s nothing that a box full of guinea pigs won’t help.
We'll know more when the tests come in but I'll bet this is something tropical.
What concerns me is that it didn't show up on your last colonoscopy
Any known allergy to mongooses, Mr. Williams?
It's actually good he has you covered -- his plan's deductible is much lower.
Take two aspirin and give him four mice a day.
Tightness in the chest.... Could be anxiety, could be any number of things. We'll have to run some tests.
When did you realize that your snake skin jacket was alive?
Visited any tropical countries recently?
Take two mongooses and see me in the morning.
Take two aspirin and a very cold shower.  Then Run.
We can deal with the constrictions but those pale white legs are worrying me.

There are better ways to clear a frog from your throat

I meant you should go on a restricted diet,
not a constricted one!
Mr. Burke, how long have you felt this tightness in your chest?
Sorry Mr. Johnson... this time I'll write ASP-irin more clearly.
Nice try Irwin. Now please drop your shorts and bend over.
His blood pressure is great. Yours, on the other hand...
Think of it as a comfort animal.
I have no issues with cross dressing, but I think you wanted a feathered boa.
You’re sure?  No feeling of tightness in your chest?
I think  it must have been my penmanship on that last prescription. Let’s try again.
You still need to sign this consent.
If this doesn’t work, we'll talk about liposuction.
Difficulty breathing. Any other symptoms?
Yeah, that 'apple a day' advice doesn't really work.
Does the snake have any known allergies?
Your chest is a little constricted, but your blood work looks just fine.
It isn’t actually venomous, so you should be fine.
Tylenol 3s for you, and a wart hog for your friend.
And also on a scale of 1 to 10, how difficult would you say it is to breathe?
I’m going to write you a prescription for flute lessons.
I think you might feel less constricted with a feather boa.
pressure getting to you?
I've got some good news and bad news for you.
First the good news. You don't have intestinal parasites
So you're calling this more of a constriction than a pain?
So you say you’ve been feeling constricted. And about how long does that feeling usually last?
Now please give me your comfort animal... and put on your examination gown.
I have a hunch that a boa constrictor is the cause of your discomfort, but we'll have to run some expensive tests to be sure.
Next time I strongly suggest a feathered one.
Can you please be more specific when you describe feeling a "tightness around your chest"?
Our blood pressure machine is out of order.
So you had no idea your emotional support animal was afraid of flying?
Sometimes you eat the thing, sometimes the thing eats you. . .very simple really.
I understand you feel some tightness.
So sorry for the delay. What seems to be the problem?
With these prescriptions, the hissing that you’re hearing should stop.
So tell me, where does it hurt?
I'm referring you to a veterinarian. I suspect your snake is suffering from a treatable case of separation anxiety.
Besides this, how was your Costa Rica ziplining experience?
...and have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath?
Yeah, man, you’re fucked.
I can squeeze you in for a follow up tomorrow.
In my expert opinion, you're under too much pressure.
Unfortunately, according to your policy, this falls under pre-existing condition
Let's see, yup... you're covered for the removal, but not for the disposal.
It gives a much more accurate reading of your blood pressure.
Ok, give him two mice and call me in the morning.
Good thing it already ate.
How long have you been feeling constricted?
You?  You're fine.  But I'd like to run some tests on the boa.
No, it’s not in your head ... this relationship is definitely suffocating you.
I’m going to start you out on four mice three times a day and we’ll see if that doesn’t reduce the pressure

Senator, you're no Lady Gaga.
‘So a little tightness in your chest?’
So how did you two meet?
You know, these fad diets only work for a time
Good news is, we finally got your blood pressure down!
No need to worry, it's not poisonous.
Think that’s bad? You should see the old lady who swallowed the fly.
So Mr. Johnson, what brings you here today?
So besides the tightness in the chest...?
I see you checked "chest tightness"
Before I prescribe this, have you taken rikitikitavidan before?
Sorry, but this is considered a pre existing condition.
Your running a fever of  101.6° and, not surprisingly, so is Ralph.
The good news is it's not the poisonous kind.
The tests confirm it. It's a human stuck in your coils. That'll have to be removed.
Just relax and let him take your blood pressure.
How bad is the pain on a “scale” of 1 to 10 feet?
Unfortunately, I’m not much of a charmer.
When did this relationship start, and why do you think she's become so possessive?
So the only thing that brings you in today is a cold?
Everything looks fine physically, but you appear to have attachment issues with your pet.
Have you visited any tropical locations recently?
Blood pressure fine. I'll summon the colonoscopy weasel.
And have you visited any tropical regions lately?
How do you spell Eve?
I see here you’re complaining of difficulty swallowing, a tightness in you chest and a compacted bowel... anything else
Yes, Mr. Johnson, this should cure your constipation rather quickly.
So what seems to be bothering you today?
Well, Harry, you did say you wanted an all-natural treatment for constipation”
And you say you're feeling contractions
When did she develop this crush on you?
-and then you took a bite of an apple. And then, Adam, what happened next?
You may experience some shortness of breath.
It's just a temporary crush.
Your cholesterol is high, but it won't kill you.
I've run some tests and think I've found the cause of your high blood pressure
Can you be more specific about the shortness of breath?
And when did the chest pains start?
Other than feeling short of breath, anything else you've noticed?
You need an Expectorant, not a Constrictor"
What is the problem?
I don't think this was the boa you were supposed to wear.
I’m writing you a prescription for an emotional support mongoose.
Are you experiencing any dizziness or shortness of breath?
I have your test results. It’s not a goiter.”
You should have gone with the non-binding agreement.
How is the Pet Therapy working for you?
It gives more accurate blood pressure reading.
Sometimes we have to go back to the ancient cures for constipation.
As your vet, I must advise against eating any more humans.
Yep. The tests confirm it's a boa.
Well, I have some good news. It’s not cancer...
We usually treat it with snake oil....
Why yes, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but it's unclear why.
Take one every day.  It'll help you unwind.
The x-rays do show some minor constriction.
This should help you both unwind

Good news! The tests show he's non-venomous.
I am afraid I cannot find a billing code for this issue. Sorry, but you will have to pay for this visit out of pocket.
To be on the safe side, I'm ordering an angiogram—a tightness in the chest can never be ignored.
Well, if you can't take a deep breath and exhale for me, maybe the best thing is just to reschedule.
The good news is that your cancer is in remission.
much less invasive than stapling
It says here you've been having difficulty breathing.
Yeah. I've been up for 72 hours. Just tell me your problem.
Good news. We've sold the movie rights.
Ah yes, I see we have you scheduled for your hissterectomy.
How long have you had this numbness in your feet?
Well now, tightness in your chest could be due to any number of causes! No need to jump to conclusions.
It DOES appear to be a snake, alright. The Herpetologist can see you next Thursday...
And I'm giving you some time off so you can unwind a bit
It's just a hissy fit, nothing to worry about.
Look...it's your choice. Do you want to feel embraced & loved, or do you want to breathe?
And when did you first experience shortness of breath?
Yeah... it’s like worms... just much, much worse!
I'd suggest putting aside  some time to unwind.
Have you tried gyrating counter clockwise?
Contact in case of emergency?
Believe it or not, I'm going to write you a script for snake oil.
As herpetologists go, you're too wrapped up in your work.
Your provider allows me to prescribe an asthma inhaler.
Congressman, I'd avoid the swamp if I were you.
So, you were cleaning his enclosure while naked?  That's interesting.
That constriction can probably be eased with a mouse or two.
It's the new treatment for constipation...
You're fine, but the snake has a skin condition.
Worst case of ringworm I've ever seen.
I'm prescribing a little snake oil.
I'm sorry, but your "pain in the asp" complaint is wrong.  The snake seems just fine.
With your lack of insurance Mr. Smith, I’m unable to remove the snake; however I can send you home with some mice
It's what's going around these days.
No, no, in my professional opinion I’d say what you’re experiencing is definitely a “boa constrictor”, not a bowel constriction.
When my patients tell me they have a pressing feeling, it's not usually so easy to diagnose.
You were right to come in
So for the first two weeks you just assumed it was your mother?
and any shortness of breath?
Take two mongooses and call me in the morning
We find the boa keeps you warmer than the paper gowns
For now, you are restricted from physical activity...well, constricted.
You know, as your proctologist I will have to look at your asp.
Many folks find that dogs provide great emotional support.
That's not what I meant when I said keep some pressure on it.
So you took a bite of the apple and then...
So what seems to be the problem today?"
I’m referring you to a snake oil salesman.
Your blood vessels are somewhat constricted, but it's good that you do have COBRA insurance.  You're covered!
The good news:  We’ve killed your tapeworm.
Good news- your cholesterol is fine.
I think I might know what's causing your shortness of breath, but I'd like to run a few more tests.
I think I know what’s causing the shortness of breath, but I want to get an X-ray.
So, you’re having difficulty swallowing...
The reports came back from the lab and it turns out, there's a snake wrapped around you.
Next time specifically ask for a feather boa.
Besides a shortness of breath, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
Your snake is in great health -- but I think it's about time you saw an MD.
Just feed it three mice daily and you'll be just fine See you in a year.
As I believe I mentioned, this experiemental weight loss protocol comes with certain risks.
I'd suggest one small rodent a day: live is best. Your snake will be fine!
It’s probably just stress.
....and you mentioned shortness of breath
We ran out of leeches.
We figured out the tightness in your chest.
Like I said, snake strangulations are only covered under the Double Platinum HMO plan, and you only have the Triple Gold PPO. But you can update your plan during your employer's open enrollment next January.
It appears your snake is suffering from acute separation anxiety.
Yes, we're trialing some new approaches to measuring blood pressure.
Well, you don’t have malaria.
She told me to taste the fruit and the next thing I knew?
Just so I'm clear, which one of you is shedding skin?
Easy mistake...although I'm surprised you didn't notice the lack of feathers.
This is why Lady Gaga went with the meat dress.
I apologize, Mr. Slithers always gets anxious at the vet...
I'm having trouble finding the code under your insurance whereby I get paid.
I’m glad to see your temperatures back to normal but the nurse couldn’t find a pulse
No, not COBRA. Do you by chance have a PYTHON plan?
Okay, I will note in the chart you have 'killer abs'.
Low oxygen, rapid weight gain . . . we'll need to run a few more tests.
Have you visited any jungles or rain forests in the last three months
So, how long have you had this human invading your private space?
Your CT Scan indicates a constriction in your upper body area. We will need to keep an eye on you until we find the source of the problem.
This is the homeopathic way to take your blood pressure
Ok, good news first.  I think we know what is causing your sleep apnea.
And we’ll get you some lotion for those scales.
I'm writing you a prescription to ease your constriction.
I think I can explain the weight gain and shortness of breadth.
I'm sorry, the nurse should have told you up front... no pets.
I believe I recommended the Ketogenic Diet not the Pythogenic Diet.
Sorry, we’re out of paper gowns.
Difficulty breathing...feeling the world is closing in on you...sounds like a anxiety. I’ll give you something to help unwind.
Okay, but I'm not prescribing you any more emotional support rabbits.
I’m going to refer you to a veterinarian.
I recommend you see a herpetologist.
How long have you been hearing this strange hissing sound?
As soon as we get that co-pay cleared up, I can deal with your first concern.
I might be able to squeeze you in on Thursday.
I warned you herpetologists not to get wrapped up in your work!
So far, nothing obvious. We'll have to do more tests.
Have you been on a plane recently?
I'm not sure your airline will allow a snake on your flight as an "emotional support animal", but here is the note you asked for.
You say your chest feels constricted?
Do you have any other partners
I've only seen one previous case and it didn't end well.
It says here there's a tightness in your chest?
As a vet, I assure you your snake is fine.
I cant really examine you unless you're willing to take off everything, Mr. Johnson.
Well, the good news is this time it's not an albatross around your neck
Cramping is common with your condition.
As your snake's veterinarian, I'm giving you a potent neurotoxin that will slowly render you defenseless.
These pills should help him unwind but call me in the morning if you still feel constricted.
I'm ordering an EKG and we'll see what's going on
When would you say you started having shortness of breath?
First question Mr. Neeman.
Have you recently been traveling abroad?
I really can't help you if you won't get undressed.
You Need Cobra not Python Insurance
No, it's not herpes; it's herpetology.
All of your test results are finally back and I think I have pinpointed the cause of your tightness of the chest.
I will write you a script for the shortness of breath, but you will need to see a specialist about the snake.
Okay, so none of your friends thought you could manage a pet store. Then what?
A little snake oil should clear that right up.
How long since the move has she been this clingy?
Mr. Ralston, I'm confident you have what we used to call grippe
Where does it hurt?
It will gradually go away.
I think I've identified your respiratory problem.
Take a deep breath for me
Your insurance company says your chest tightness and shortness of breath are preexisting conditions.
I'll prescribe something easy to swallow.
On a scale of 1 to 10, what is your pain level right now?
You can't imagine how many cases like yours we see."
The ultrasound is indicating you may have a boa constriction, but I'd like to follow up with a thorough physical exam and barium enema.
Let’s test how long you can hold your breath!
Say this phrase twice daily for a week and it should turn back into a staff.
You just need a dose of antihisstamines.
The X-ray shows extra vertebrae.
So, the nurse tells me you are having trouble breathing.
It appears her separation anxiety has worsened.
Fortunately, your test results show that it is a python, not an anaconda.
So, it says here you've had a tightening feeling in your chest and shortness of breath.  We'll do an EKG today and I'd like you to come back next week for a stress test.
This time I will write the prescription more clearly, oil not coil.
And then I want you to put on the gown so that it's open in the back.
No, I indicated compression socks.
Worst case of coilitas I've seen
When did you notice breathing difficulties?
So Adam how's Eve been
And would you say you’re experiencing any work-related pressure or strain?
She handed me an apple and said she’d be right back.
I put your odds at about one serpent.
I’m prescribing you this emotional support animal for your anxiety issues.
I'm referring you to a psychoherpetologist. He might be able to help you unwind.
And what brings you in here today, Mr. Smith?
It says here you suffered ‘the fall of man.’ So, you fell?
Yes, it counts as a pre-existing condition. It takes months to digest someone your size.
I strongly suggest you take precautions during mating season
The Good news is the snake is in perfect health.
I'm going to recommend a herpetologist.
Trouble breathing?
I think I can explain the shortness of breath.
I'm afraid your insurance company is about to put the squeeze on you too."
How was your vacation to the Everglades?
Says here that you are experiencing some tightness in your chest.
You took the subway?
The test results hint at a possible cause of your chest tightness.
And when did you first start experiencing shortness of breath?
So, I understand that you are her therapy human.
First, I'm obliged to ask if you'd be willing to take part in a clinical trial for a new drug that treats patients with your condition.
Have you been feeling under pressure lately?
It's PETA I'm most worried about.
And how long have you had this tightness in your chest?
Let's start with the good news. We tested for pancreatitis, and it came back negative.
No, I said aspirin, not put an asp on.
My prescription was for "snake oil" not "snake coil".
Luckily we caught this early.  Once they start to constrict our treatment options become limited.
Just as I expected,  the lab results show you're  wound too tight.
Can you be more specific than just a squeezing sensation?
That's nothing.  The last patient came in here with a giraffe stuck up his ass.
Since you're not feeling any pain, let's just wait and see if it goes away.
Yes, Eve said the same thing
I think we can rule out COPD for your shortness of breath.
I think the bigger concern here are your cholesterol levels.
Do you feel any tightness in the chest area?
Perhaps you should have eaten the  apple
The good news, it's not so much herpes as it is herpetology."
It is really quite dangerous and it's just a matter of time before...   well this is awkward... I see you have a DNR.
He gives much more detailed results than our CAT scan.
Possible side effects include tightness,faintness,claustrophobia,hysteria,loss of blood flow,immobility,neck strain,over-heating,and the sneaking suspicion you belong in a zoo.
Could you describe this 'tightening' feeling?
You can remove the boa also. You haven't got anything that  I haven't seen before.
It’s one thing to embrace your fear of snakes, and quite another when your phobia embraces you.
Now exhale...
On the plus side, nobody will notice that nasty psoriasis anymore.
It’s a common enough condition. I am going to prescribe a ten day supply of mice until it sheds you.
Your insurance insists it’s a preconstrictor condition, so they won’t cover it.
...and 50mg a day for viper-tension.
I thought I was clear yesterday - the muscle relaxant is not for you.
So tell me, Mr. Jones, when did you first notice you had difficulty breathing?
That's not what I meant by a restrictive diet.
No, I think we can rule out a tape worm.
So what is your support boa’s name?
Just be happy you didn't have to see the proctologist for this.
Let's get you down to radiology for a second opinion.
First and foremost Mr. Hanover, do not completely exhale
Have you had any other symptoms?
And here’s the last question.  Are you allergic to anti-snake venom?
I think I can explain that feeling of tightness in your chest.
If you think this is bad, try not paying your bill.
I'm going to prescribe him some oxycodone and he should loosen right up.
You're fortunate the snake took the Valium. Here's another prescription.
I am afraid we will have to do more tests.
Any family history of reptile codependency?
Sorry Howard, since Trump took office millions of swamp creatures have been coming out of hiding and heading for DC.
I'm not liking that blood pressure.
You need to unwind. Literally.
Now for the bad news...
Well, Adam, we can take care of it this time, but next time choose a fig-leaf.
Nothing serious - just a mild case of the grippe.
I'll just renew your Emotional Support Animal prescription while you're here.
Yes, I know you’ve been waiting an hour but he hasn’t swallowed you yet, so - we’re good.
Any unusual bowel movements?
I'm going to prescribe an oil I think may help.
We've got a couple of options here, but not necessarily a lot of time.
Have you recently traveled to any tropical countries?
I’m writing a prescription for a pair of pants.
You should have specified a "feather" boa.
Uh huh, and have your contractions increased since your last visit?
Other than tightness in your chest is there anything else to report.
I'm going to give you a subscription for a small deer.
Either of you allergic to muscle relaxers?
Tightness..in..the...chest. OK. Any changes to your diet or exercise?
It says here you’re experiencing difficulty in swallowing, a tightness in your chest and a compacted bowel... anything else?
I see the snake-oil salesman got you again.
Your health is fine, Jack, but you seem a little tightly wound.
I am writing a prescription for a muscle relaxer for both of you! Good Luck!
We’re ALL feeling the squeeze, Mr Patient.
I'm prescribing something to make you less delicious.
With about two days of human body heat, she should be fine.
Unfortunately, you did not pick up the wrap around option to your health plan.
I'm still going to need you to fully disssssrobe.
The good news is that the squeezing sensation in your chest is not a heart attack.
Are you certain this is the same snake that bit you?
Those YouTube challenges keeps getting weirder
We're going to have to run a few more tests.
I'm prescribing a muscle relaxant.
You said 'parasite' on the phone so we were kind of thinking internal.
Besides 'difficulty in breathing,' do you have any other complaints?
You're not the first guy who bought the wrong thing, when his wife asked him to buy her a boa.
I'm referring you to a Pet Psychiatrist for Snuggles. I think we may have a case of separation anxiety.
When did you first notice the breathing problem?
Does it interfere with your sleep?
You seem all wound up.
I still can't believe Samuel Jackson slept through your entire flight.
So you say this happened shortly after you ate an apple.
The HMO requires us to try motivational interviewing first  to show the snake the advantages of releasing you
Can you sign this release form?
It's going around . . . and around . . . and around.
Insurance makes us fill these out.  Question 1: What are your symptoms?
With chest pain we always have to rule out a heart condition.
High blood pressure is the real threat here though.
Yeah, well, everyone is afraid of the scale.
I’d suggest more quality time to resolve his separation anxiety
The good news is your blood pressure has gone way down!
You seem pretty tightly wound!
Next time just be a bit more careful ordering Monty Python on Amazon.
Tightness in your chest, labored breathing, elevated heart rate......do you use a lot of salt Mr. McCready?
Your insurance no longer covers emotional support reptiles.
You’re suffering from constrictive heart failure
So, other than feeling chest compression, what other complaints do you have?
You describe a "squeezing sensation"  in your chest area.  I'm ordering a full cardiac work-up.
Your blood pressure is a bit high... are you experiencing undo stress?
As your vet I must say, you seem tightly wound, have you been eating lately
Looks like you’ve been too charming for your own good.
So,I see that you're here for a second opinion.
Are you feeding him enough?
The symptoms began *after* you ate the apple, is that right?
and...have you traveled to any foreign countries lately?
It says here you would like something removed.
It's the original pre-existing condition.
I can see you've been under a lot of pressure, lately
I’ ll check your blood pressure after you’ve unwound a bit
Next time, just remember, what goes around comes around.
We’ve found that squeezing every last penny out of you is more palatable than affixing leeches to suck you dry.
It's a real shame that the name 'asp'bergers syndrome is already taken
There’s nothing wrong with you medically.  If it bites you, be sure to come right back.
I'm sorry but your HMO lists having a snake as a pre-existing condition.
I don't think a probiotic's gonna help.
My brother is a veterinarian, maybe you should go see him?
Get rid of the apple tree.
I would have suggested Mira-Lax, 
but I'm sure your shaman knows best.
I call this nature's Heimlich Maneuver.
In the plus column, you’ve quit smoking.
According to clinical trials, the treatment is mutually beneficial.  The snake keeps you from smoking, and you keep the snake from suffocating other people.
A couple hours a day for the blood pressure, and I'll see you in 6 months.
I'm afraid your insurance doesn't cover pythonectomy.

There are lots better ways to get a hug.

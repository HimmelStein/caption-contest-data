He offered us a franchise, but I think it’s a pyramid scheme.
Finally, hotdogs are at the top of the food pyramid.
Of course it’s kosher – who do you think built this place?
I think it's safe to assume it contains preservatives.
No, thanks--you never know who goes into those things.
We did it. All seven vendors of the ancient world.
He must be the only one in the whole Middle East actually making concessions.
Look, It was either this or Pizza Tut
No thanks. Those things always get stuck in my sarcophagus.
Pretty steep for two hot dogs.
Never eat anything with an expiration date ending in BC.
Did you tell him he was missing the point?
It's an old recipe he got from his mummy.
These must be good for us … they're from the top of the food pyramid.
The korean taco truck at Stonehenge was better.
Right, so you're not actually selling the hots dogs but recruiting others to sell them for you. There's a name for this business model but it escapes me.
It would seem more exotic if we weren't in New Jersey.
This place has been around forever.
According to the legend, if we both eat these we will toot in common.
I hear their wraps are to die for.
An to think--at the very spot where Moses founded Hebrew National!
He really ought to put up a sign about the escalator on the other side.
I never heard of a hot dog with relics.
Kinda steep for a hotdog, wouldn't you say?
Could you go back and get me one of those relish packets, please?
WOW !! Now THAT’S a pop-up.
Mine has the mustard. Yours has the curse.
I always thought the food pyramid was just a metaphor.
Why are they wrapped in gauze?
After this we should go see the leaning tower of pizza.
Technically, it's a polyhedron scheme.
But if you REALLY loved me you'd go back for extra mustard.
He said he didn't want a tip.
I just find the name "pharaohs in a blanket" unappetizing.
Thanks!  I would've gone up myself, but I didn't see the point.
Home of the original Slider
Sorry, we haven't had kosher hot dogs on the menu since the Exodus.
And all I have to do is get five more people to buy hot dogs?
It's why I love Vegas. In Giza, you can't get a hotdog.
You forgot the Tutankhondiments.
Pretty steep for a just a hotdog
I don't trust the whole food pyramid thing.
This is where Nathan's first started 4070 years ago
Frank has a meat cart at the top of Giza. He spots 12 customers at the base. The angle of depression is 36°. Frank can make 10 hotdogs/minute. If Frank’s stand is 146 m off the ground, can he make enough hot dogs in time? Show your work.
He says the secret is the method of preservation.
They also sell Pi.
Ketchup? Is nothing sacred?
If course it's kosher. Who do you think built this hotdog stand?
I've got great news: they're Hebrew National!
I still can't believe this guy got his ad on the back of the 1 dollar bill.
We have to get drinks at the oasis.
Don't you think it's a little steep for a hot dog?
Wonder why he was out of sliders ??
No thanks, I'll wait for a square meal.
It's a cubit-long.
We've been dating for five years.  I was hoping for a diamond.
He made a killing during the flood.
Wow. How were they made, and by whom?
No thanks. I'm trying to avoid preservatives.
Wow, who would have guessed that it was hot dogs at the top of the food pyramid?
You're sure the bun is made with ancient grains?
Do you want an explanation or a hot dog?
Let my hot dog go.
"How is this not a pyramid scheme if the man at the top gets all the money?
...and afterwards, we can stroll over to the Sphinx for a gelatto.
It's from the top of the food pyramid.
I still don't see the point.
Funny, on the dollar bill he always looked like an eye.
So these are the franks you've been tut-tutting about.
Ok, ok, so it wasn’t a mirage. Now can I please have one?
Of course they're Kosher.  Who do you think built it?
Hot dog?  Or a pyramid scheme?
Twenty dollars? Egypt you!
I seriously doubt it’s Hebrew National!
What'd he mean by "relatively fresh?"
I feel bad supporting anything built with slave labor, but these really are the best brats in Cairo.
This place is a tourist trapezoid.
A little steep for a hot dog.
It's inflatable!!
I was hoping for a square meal.
I had no idea hot dogs were so high on the food pyramid.
Did you grab any napkins?
Zagat said it was the pinnacle of Egyptian cuisine.
He’s been on this corner for ages.
I have a feeling this may be some sort of pyramid scheme
It's cold.
I can’t believe they serve Hebrew nationals here
I offered but he insisted "No Tip"
Can you ask him for a napkin?
Sorry, I'm not going back for mustard.
This one's yours.  The other one's Mayan
So now all you have to do is sell two hotdogs to each of your friends...
I just don't see the point.
Well, the on-line menu was all in hieroglyphics, so I’m not sure what I ordered.
Well, because they actually sell a product, it's multi-level marketing, not a pyramid scheme.
No, thanks. I like beer! I still like beer! Sometimes I had too many beers!
Oh, he doesn’t actually sell hot dogs. He sells hot dog opportunities, and then you sell the hot dogs.
I don’t know why you always drag me to these tourist trapezoids.
Sure it's more expensive, but you're paying for the experience.
This is taking street food to new heights
I bought one hotdog and I have to sell this one. I think it’s a goddamn pyramid scheme!
HEY ... He shortchanged me $10.
Easier than the ones on the Washington Monument
I’m sure it’s fine. They’ve been perfecting the art of preserving meats for thousands of years.
Pharaoh's Phamous Phrankfurters - it's a hike, but it's better than Pizza Tut.
Uh. No. I doubt they're Hebrew National.
What luck, finding a place that's Ziggurat rated.
It's good for you. It's at the top of the food pyramid.
Like the pyramids, he's not sure how it was made
Actually, I was going to hit the salad bar at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
Let's hit the Sphinx next. I hear they've turned it into a pez dispenser.
... and then *those* people each find two people to whom they can sell hotdogs.
I thought we were going to Pizza Tut?
I can't believe that's on the food pyramid.
I thought he was selling sliders.
Oops... I forgot to leave a tip.
And you're sure it's kosher?
He said we're lucky since he normally doesn't bring his pyramid and cart here on Tuesdays.
It's like they say: location, location, location.
He says he answers to a higher authority!
Just wipe the mustard off, I’m not going back up there.
Egyptian? No it’s Chicago style. Why do you ask?
It’s only fair given the amount of falafel we sell in New York
It was a tomb-for-one special.
No sauerkraut! That really Sphinx!"
The hotdogs aren't great, but the line is always short.
Pyramids are like hot dogs. It’s better not to see them being made.
How can I be sure this is not a pyramid scheme?
He gives away the hot dogs. The rappel rope is $15.
He's a spiritual master. He made me one with everything.
Top of the food pyramid doesn't mean what you think, Albert.
Sounds like a pyramid scheme to me."
Since 2630 B.C., they’ve been known for their preservatives.
It's a really unique hot dog.  They call it the Tut Uncommon.
I thought his prices were steep, but at least the line was short.
Turns out they're Hebrew National.
Go back for the mustard
$8 each? Egypt us!
I think he's missing the point...
I said Relish, not Relics
I hope you like preservatives.
Yours is the Cleopatra. Mine is the Mark Antony Wiener.
I just get this weird feeling that it's some kind of pyramid scheme!
Apparently hot dogs are at the top of the food pyramid.
Future archeologists will spend years arguing about how he got the cart up there.
Oh, thanks, but I asked for the Sisyphus Dog with onions. Would you mind going back up?
I hate to put money into a pyramid scheme, but I was starving.
Our bloodlines will be forever cursed, but they're delicious and totally worth it.
I expected a wrap.
Would it be too Sisyphean for you to go back and get me some relish?
Let’s sit inside where it’s cooler.
You should save some room for desert!
Of course they're healthy.  They're from the top of the food pyramid
Okay,it's not technically street food.
Really! You text him and he slides it down?
I said I wanted onions
These are straight from the top of the food pyramid.
Seems like Egypt you on the relish.
I always knew hotdogs would make it to the top of the food pyramid.
That guy took over after the Giant Eye stopped paying rent.
How old are they?
Did you ask him if it's lonely at the top?
He relishes it up there.
They finally opened Frankfurters Tomb
Don't look so smug, I saw the elevator in the back.
You're kidding, that's what you found at the top of the food pyramid??
It's one of the 7 most wonderful hot dogs in the world.
Mustard and relish are at the Sphinx.
I think this may be a pyramid scheme.
When we've finished these, let's get something on a cone.
Do they come with Mayan-naise?
He got the recipe from his mummy.
Thanks, but those have got to be just loaded with preservatives.
Larry, I said with ketchup.
Last food for the next seven pyramids?
See? I told you geometry would come in handy some day.
He claims that he's been "wheelchair  accessible" for nearly 5k years.
I sell it and you get half of the profits? What kind of scheme is this?
Three words: location, location, location.
Frankly, this looks like a pyramid scheme to me.
We're his first customers in ages.
I got you a Kuhfu dog with everything and a bag of Cheops!"
They look good but I’m missing the point.
Who knew hot dogs would be on top of the food pyramid?
I have no idea how to scale a polyhedron. I got these from the cart around the corner.
Cubitlongs!
He's taken the lowly hotdog to the next level.
You’d think he’d know why business is so slow
Did you ask if they use preservatives?
Jerry's looking for franchisees, but I can't shake the feeling it's a pyramid scheme.
He misunderstood the meaning of 'Food Pyramid'.
You'll never guess what kind of scheme that hot dog vendor wanted me to invest in.
I think Egypt us !
You're missing the point.
I’m surprised he didn’t have any wraps.
Are these from the top of the food pyramid?
What's really impressive is they're kosher
I love immersing ourselves in new cultures
When you said we were going to see the top dog, this isn't really what I expected.
Sorry, I forgot to mention relish. Would you mind?
You do know how many preservatives they use here, don't you?
I realize it's a pyramid scheme, but let's just say I'm in de Nile.
Welcome  to Trump Towers at the Vallley of the Damned.
No, thanks. I just had a kebab at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
Probably not as old as the ones spinning in the convenience store...
No one knows how they're made.
"The good news is that the guy says they're repurposing  ruins of failed civilizations.  The bad news is that next week they're opening up at the Washington Monument.
If you don't like this, I saw a McDonalds at the Sphinx
… and after he finished Trump University he scooped up this little operation.
So that's why they call them sliders.
He said his name is Ponzi?
on second thought, i’d prefer to go back to the Sphinx and grab a pretzel.
Oh, I wanted brown mustard darling.
I think we’re really just paying for the view.
Where does he wash his hands?
They're half price if you're with your Mummy.
I said, no locusts.
Few people know that a small group of Egyptian rebels worshipped the dog instead of the cat.
I've seen older ones in New York City.
Are you sure it's cooked? It looks Ra to me.
Get your own damn mustard.
Seems like a tourist trap.
Do you want the one with or without the the curse?
...and you say in a few weeks we'll get ten dozen hotdogs if we buy these?
Here’s your starter pack. Now, the only thing you have to do is recruit 4 more more members......
The hot dogs are okay, but you are mostly paying for the view.
How much?  He must have seen us coming.
It's impossible to get a square meal around here.
Didn't they have Arab Spring Rolls?
Sorry, he said they all have preservatives.
Odd to see a Hebrew National in Egypt.
I've heard that he built his business from the ground up!
He's literally the god of street food.
They have regular, footlong, and cursed.
So...did you ask about the "use by" date?
You couldn’t reach my brand in the tampon aisle but this you can reach?
Was there a line?
When you say locally-sourced, what exactly does that mean?
After this whole Kavanaugh thing, you put that in my face?
I don't know - there's no place up there for him to wash his hands.
It was nothing. There’s an elevator ‘round back.
What did you have to sacrifice for these?
Does it have preservatives?
Nice catch.
It's ok honey, I got it from the top of the food pyramid.
Now that's a food pyramid.
You forgot napkins.
After this, we could get some lemon Isis.
I’m not going back up there for ketchup.
Yes, there really is a food pyramid.
They're made with the best preservatives.
It feels so good to get out of New York.
Do you have any Mayan-aise?
But it’s at the top of the food pyramid.
So, these are free, if we can convince two other couples to make the climb?
I thought he'd sell wraps.
I didn't want the meaning of life! I wanted ketchup.
Calls himself Sisyphus. Catch is you always want another one
So this is elevated street food?
They’re messy—why didn’t you ask for some papyrus?
Kosher dogs, Honey.  The guys’ family’s had the place for 3000 years.
“This will have to do until they open a Pizza Tut.”
Doesn't it come with Tater-Tuts?
You forgot the relish.
Moses said we should get it to go.
Are there steps on the other side?
So with Prime I don't have to climb up to the stand?
You've never heard of the tummy's curse?
It's one fifty for the hot dog, eight fifty for delivery.
He said condiments are on top of the Sphinx.
They paved paradise and put up a pyramid.
I think I understand.  You sell me five, and then I sell  five to five friends making mine free.  Man, what can go wrong!
At least New York is taking rising sea levels seriously.
So now you’re not hungry
I didn’t relish the climb either
Are these the Sphinx Links or the Tut Dogs?
Hebrew National? I seriously doubt it.
No, seriously, it’s good for you. It’s at the top of the food pyramid.
I suspect these aren’t Hebrew National.
Wow, it's really well wrapped.
He says if we find people  to buy these, he’ll sell us ten more at half the price.
Trust me, they don't call these Top Dogs for nothing
Hot dogs on top of the food pyramid!?!?
You want some mustard? Then you go answer the riddle.
They're just like the ones my mummy used to make.
Very simple. They built it under him.
I told you, just because he can see Coney Island from there doesn’t make it authentic.
He's out of sliders.
My ex, Sisyphus, would have gone back to get to mustard.
I know, right? Imagine what I'd do for a Klondike bar.
You believed him when he said it was Kosher?
He calls it, “Tomb Steak”.
Thanks, I hope it wasn't a huge sacrifice.
If you buy two you get to use the slide on the other side
Are you sure this isn't a pyramid scheme?"
He says it's his mummy's recipe.
He just sits there. There is no point.
We opened up the tomb, and they were perfectly preserved.
It may not be convenient but it has great visibility.
It doesn't look like it's a foot long, but maybe it's just the perspective.
I'd rather go to Pizza Tut
Don't worry, they're safe to eat.  the Egyptians are known for their preservatives.
That hot dog vendor is sitting on a goldmine
It's probably past its expiration date.
You know, it’s all about the journey.
He's got it all to himself...location, location, location.
He said "tutkankhamen"  in ancient Egyptian  actually means "bratwurst."
Well, I’m sorry, but what about ‘with mustard’ didn’t you understand?
He said it was made long ago and what’s inside is still a mystery.
I know.... we're missing the WHOLE point!"
Trust me. I know a good hot-dog stand when I see one.
More good news! There's a Starbucks at The Great Sphinx.
Bernie Madoff liked it a lot.
And a Diet Coke, sorry...
Its a great concept. You burn off the calories just getting there.
He was a lighthouse keeper, with a dream.
So when you said you started a "hotdog pyramid scheme" . . .
You went all the way to the top of the food pyramid just for me?
Do these hotdogs have any preservatives?
He has been there for years
We call it tomb with a view
I love his 'Tut Dog', it's truly uncommon.
Just like mummy used to make!
It's pronounced 'haute' dog
He said it's the longest running pyramid scheme on the Nile
Kosher?
He has five 〰️’s on Yelp!
I still think “Just the Tip” is an odd name for a hotdog stand”
Who knew there was an actual Food Pyramid?
He said he had  the franchise a month before he realized it was a pyramid scheme.
Hebrew National. They left it behind.
It’s a Pharaoh-Furter.  When they dig you up 3000 years from now, it will still be in your stomach.
Egypt reminds me so much of Coney Island.
Let’s go. This place looks deserted.
His boss told him the most important sales tool is location. I think he got the point
It's good, but, not exactly the eighth wonder of the world.
She's been up there ever since her 23andme results said she was 3% Egyptian
Wait. So all I have to do is sell these to two other people?
They’re made from a 4,000-year old recipe.
He said his family has been selling kosher dogs here since the early B.C.'s.
What makes you always fall for these pyramid schemes?
The stairs and an escalator were on the other side.
That cart has been in his family for over 4,500 years!
Oh honey, I'm sure it has way too many preservatives.
So that's the newly installed roof top restaurant?
Lemme guess. We now have to get four other people to eat these?
Be honest... is this hotdog thing a front for a pyramid scheme?
It may be a food pyramid, Chad, but it's not THE food pyramid.
Just for this millennium they're two for the price of one.
Welcome to Queen Ketchupsut's pyramid.
Now that's what I call haut cuisine
No worries, I checked the "sell-by" date - these are good for up to 5,000 years.
It's made with all-natural preservatives.
I thought it would be falafel.
I said mustard, not ketchup.
I was hoping this was a mirage, but I’ll take it.
The Sarcophagus Dog is to die for.
We get friends to give him hotdogs, and then he gives us more hot dogs. He swears it's not a scheme.
$10 bucks! That's steep
Toot’s Unkahmen Dogs, of course!
The prices were a little steep.
This is your idea of high cuisine?
He says the competition eventually eroded
This isn’t just a hot dog, it’s your chance to get involved in a great multi-level marketing opportunity!
And all you have to do to make it up there is get ten other people to join you in selling hotdogs.
Sure, it starts with one, but it's a slippery slope.
Trust me, it's not ANY kind of scheme.
Why would I want to sell mine to two other people?
Condiments are in a hidden entrance around back.
So you're saying there was a point.
Walk like an Egyptian and get me some sauerkraut.
'Can I have a sheik with it?'
The condiments are one pyramid over.
I don't know about this guy. All that storage space and he doesn't carry sauerkraut.
Kind of gives new meaning to location, location, location, huh?
Oh, NOW you want a hotdog?!?
Sorry that took so long. He tried to talk me into some kind of pyramid scheme.
They're called King Pups.
You're kidding! He calls it Ponzi's Hot Dogs?
That guy in the wheelchair in line ahead of you sure left in a hurry."
He's offering immortality, but it's just another pyramid scheme.
The expiration date says 4,000 B.C. so we're fine.
No hot dogs for me.  My body is a temple.
The first great mystery is how the pyramids were made.  Next
 comes what's in these hot dogs.
I prefer to eat from the bottom of the food pyramid.
Good catch...
They’re called Trumpdogs?  And he sold you a distributorship?  Did he tell you you’re also an idiot?
No one knows how these things were made.
No, the one the aliens built has a vending machine
He is at the top of the food pyramid.
For some reason he didn't want the tip.
We’re finding that people are taking to the free hotdogs much better than ritual human sacrifice.
Did you ask about preservatives?
He doesn't believe in tips.
How they were made remains a mystery.
No the tip wasn't included.
Are these pharoh trade?
This doesn't explain why it's on the dollar bill.
Go ahead, it's fine.  He told me he used to have a cart outside the Met.
That's one helluva pyramid scheme.
I hope it is better than the falafel on the Empire State Building.
We won't be having seconds.
Sure, they're good, but I still think you're putting him on a pedestal
The prices here are too steep. I rather go to Pizza Tut.
Yuck! That thing looks like it was made 1,000 years ago.
It's not technically a pyramid scheme because the top's flat.
It just looks shriveled. I wanted mummified.
Is it true he hasn't changed the water in 4000 yrs?
I got it from the top of the food pyramid.
Talk about a pyramid  scheme!
I just don't think we should support pyramid schemes
I told you I wanted mustard
To the contrary.  Business is at its peak.
He does not relish the commute to work.
What makes you think this is a pyramid scheme?
I think this guy has reached his peak
What, no onions?
That doesn't make it Egyptian food.
It's from the top of the food pyramid, how can it be bad for you?
Cynthia says this place also has a great hidden bar chamber.
It’s a thing now.  There’s a churros cart at the top of the Eiffel Tower.
This first one is free as long as you bring two more buyers.
Now this is how we fight the obesity crisis.
That's it?...
The secret of the pyramid is a hot dog?
I said I wanted to see Egyptian relics, not relish.
So THAT's the devil's triangle!
Try one, they're to die for.
He said it was from an ancient recipe.
Did he say why he’s changing locations?
That one's yours, and this one's Mayan.
And his prices are steep too!
They haven't done wraps for a couple thousand years.
I thought self-actualization would be more complicated.
He said he still makes more money up there than he did at Amazon
I get it but "Not your'e Mummies Hot Dogs" still seems like a cheesy name.
I like how they're wrapped.
He really is the top dog.
No thanks, I had pizza at the Sphinx
It may be the top of the food pyramid, but I still want mustard.
I told you they're at the top of the food pyramid.
and he said if each of us gets 2 people to also buy a hot dog...
It took you forever because you bought it at peak time.
I guess my diet is ancient history.
Can you run back up and make sure it's gluten free?
I hear there’s a great burger place at the top of Everest.
Not a problem, there is an escalator on the other side.
Its a Hebrew National and it answers to a higher authority!
The eleventh plague is type 2 diabetes.
Should be good. I hear they use aged beef and ancient grains.
I hope you were wearing your Fitbit.
I assume the stairs are on the other side.
No thanks...I'll grab a taco from the Mesoamerican pyramid down the street.
I heard he got the idea from the back of a dollar bill.
It's not a scheme, it's a franchise.
What took you so long?
So he has taken his food to a new level?
Apparetly hot dogs have been elevated to the top of the food pyramid.
You can't tell me you really believe the ancient Egyptians built not only a pyramid but a hotdog stand without extraterrestrial help.
You never know where you'll run into someone from the old neighborhood.
He says it's not only local but historically authentic.
He says, 'business is ramping up.'
Don't ask, just eat.
I said mustard, no relish.
They said to avoid Ra meat, but this one looks local.
That dog looks 5000 years old.
We call it the Ra Dog - but really, it's fully cooked.
He just said, why not up here.
I had no idea that hot dogs were at the top of the food pyramid!
He calls them tut-dogs.
I wouldn't have thought hotdogs were a the top of the food pyramid.
I love coming here. There's never a line at Climb and Slide Hot Dogs.
Is it organic?
It's reinventing Maslow's Hierarchy. You work your way to the bottom.
Street food has really reached new heights these days.
What do you mean they were out of mustard?
Told you hot dogs were at the top f the food pyramid!
I think there are steps on the other side.
Thank God they haven't commercialized this place.
You paid how much for these?!! I can’t believe you fell for another pyramid scheme!
He said the hot dog sales are good, but the REAL money is in recruiting new members.
These are from the food truck on the other side. Up there it's a piano and he's playing Cheops Sticks.
Wait, I'm supposed to buy these from you and then sell them to someone else? What kind of scheme is this?
Listen to this.  He says if we sell these hot dogs to 10 people who in turn each sell them to another 10 people and so on, we'll have enough money for our own vendor cart.
A weiner, huh? You men will go to the ends of the earth to over-compensate.
Now you eat this one and we both get rich
'Well it's supposed to be the top dog around."
I guess you have to hustle kosher hot dogs to reach the promised land these days.
He seems to be involved in some sort of scheme...
But I said no mustard.
The one at the Eiffel Tower had more sauces
Behold the eighth wonder of the world! Only cost me $4.
If you’re in a hurry to leave, you can get your hot dog with matzoh
How come the ketchup is all at one end?
How many times have we heard the looters-stole-the-condiments story?
Usually everyone's buried with the pharoah but the hotdog man got left out.
Wow!!  Nathan’s !   Who knew?
He's trying to franchise the idea.  To me it's just another pyramid scheme.
This is the pyramid of Tutankhamun's cousin, Frankfurter.
And to think, we used to have to go all the way
to Coney Island for Nathan's.
What's it madoff?
I don’t care what sort of scheme it is, his hot dogs are terrific.
I got you the Ramesses II with extra onion and I'm having the Sobekneferu with French mustard.
You're the one who wanted an authentic Egyptian experience.
And then each of those friends buys two hot dogs...?
I took the stairs on the other side since the handicap ramps look dangerous.
He’s known as the Top Dog
I guess they are still trying to pay King Tut's funeral expenses.
Now you tell me you want mustard?
Now you tell me you also wanted a soda?
He says we have to go the Sphinx for the condiments.
What do you mean you didn't get relish!
I hear his ancestors were awarded the very first Hebrew National franchise.
Top Dog?
All I said was that the restaurant has a view.
Not Kosher, but it comes from closer to God.
On second thought, I think I will have the sauerkraut.
Who would've thought hot dogs were found at the top of the food pyramid?
Finally a pyramid scheme that I can get behind.
King Pup.
Location, location, location.
They say this is the ORIGINAL “Hebrew National” stand
At last Phil reached the pinnacle of hot dog salesmanship
He swears they're kosher."
Strange, tastes like a lot of preservatives but he swore he just unwrapped these
And best of all, it's kosher.
He said he inherited the location from his great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather.
I'm so tired of these Pyramid scams.
Little known fact, the Maya were conquered by the Mayers.
This you call one of the Seven Wonders of the World?  Really?  Go get me some sauerkraut.
Someone's in the Madoff suite
I didn’t realize hot dogs were at the top of the food pyramid.
At least it's wheelchair accessible.
It's on wheels for catering.
He's taken fast food to new heights!
Thanks, sweetie, but the Use By date on this dog is 3,000 B.C.
Are they boiled or sun-dried?
Are you sure it's not a pyramid scheme?
Why are they wrapped in cotton?
You’re eating another one? It’s a slippery slope...
I don't care if it is on a 'Pharoal', I asked for mustard.
I've always wanted to experience one of the wonders of the ancient world.
That's king-sized?
You're sure this isn't a pyramid scheme?
Now you understand why Uber Eats is so important!
I can't wait to get my Cheops into one of those.
On second thought, I'd rather have a sphinxburger.

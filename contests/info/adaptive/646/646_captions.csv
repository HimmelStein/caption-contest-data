Like it would have killed you to ask him for directions.
Oh, shit! What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?
Don’t bring a camera, you said.  Just enjoy the experience, you said.
He just walked by like he thinks we don't exist.
He asked that we please wait while he gets his camera or his friends will never believe him.
Oh, so first he doesn't exist and now he's flirting with me?
He said it’s not him but he gets asked that all the time.
Unplug" you said. "Leave the phones in the car" you said
He doesn’t believe in us either.
He walked past me like I  didn’t exist.
He said he didn't believe in us either.
Once and for all, Bob, stop following us. It’s over.
He wants us to wait here while he gets his camera. He doesn't think think anyone will believe him.
He asked for us to wait here while he gets his camera.
He says we're only allowed to take blurry photos.
He acted like we don't even exist.
Oh, he says he doesn't believe in you either.
I believe you owe me a dollar.
Before you meet my family, there's something I need to tell you.
He said that he doesn't believe in us either.
Yeah, he saw us, but they'll never believe him
He said he doesn’t believe in us either.
He says he never really believed in us either.
He's a lot less blurry in person.
Would it kill you to, just once, ask someone for directions?
"Leave the phone in the car,"  you said!
"There'll be no time for photos," you said!
He said  he always believed we existed.
I think we should start seeing other species.
He can't believe we're real. He's going to get a camera.
We went on one date! How was I supposed to know we would run into him here?
Still think we should have left our phones in the car Mr. Be In The Moment?
He’s leaving. Apparently he’s late for a summit meeting.
He said he's not surprised; he's questioned his own existence his whole life.
'We'll leave our smartphones in the car,' you said. 'Let's really be in the moment this time,' you said.
He's really let himself go since the impeachment. In fact I wasn't sure it was really him till he grabbed my ass
He said if anyone asks, we haven’t seen him.
He’s less blurry in person.
He was going to come down until I told him who the president is.
He said, due to the government shutdown, the rest rooms are closed.
He asked us to wait here while he got his camera.  He said if he doesn't take our picture, his friends won't believe we exist.
He ignored us like we didn't even exist.
Sure, Rich, and Santa Claus is right behind you. Now can we please get back to talking about what happened last night?
He says the real abomination is your cargo pants."
He said there’s no such thing as human beings and no one will believe he saw us.
The difference is, he, unlike you, is evolving.
It's 2019. We don't use the word "abominable" anymore.
If we could just stop arguing, we might actually see something interesting!
That guy? He’s a legend around here.
All I said was "I've seen bigger".
He's going to try 'outdoorsy' instead of 'abominable' in his dating profile
Sorry, but I was cold, he's covered in fur. It just happened.
Unlike you, I'm fine with asking a local for directions.
As soon as he's out of the way, can you take my picture ?
He's a legend around here.
Just man up and ask him for directions
No! I will not "look behind me", and stop trying to change the subject.
I hate it when you won't ask locals for directions.
Nice try, but I'm not falling for "made you look" again!
First person we see in days and you STILL won't ask for directions!
He’s mature, ruggedly handsome, and not lost.  Owen, this is goodbye.
Don't bother. He's lost too.
Let’s leave our phones home,” you said
He doesn't believe in you either.
I obviously made my decision! Please stop following us!
He says he might have the right charger.
You and your 'let's experience the hike and not bring a camera'
I’m not falling for that “he’s right behind you” trick.
No, Craig, I don’t believe Bigfoot is over my left shoulder. I believe you have commitment issues.
Can't you just ask for directions, he's clearly a local.
Oh, like we don’t run into your exes every time we go grocery shopping.
He doesn't think we're real.
He said he was ready to go public, but with the government shutdown, no one at the Smithsonian picked up the phone.
He said, "I exist. Get over it.
SERIOUSLY, he whistled at me, and you do NOTHING?
He said it’s always been on his bucket list, too.
He said he'll come back down after the 2020 election.
You never look at ME like that.
Climate change has everyone relocating.
Let's get back to nature", you said. "Leave the cell phones in the cabin", you said
I trust him, he's a local.
He doesn't believe we exist
He saw me but said his friends would never believe him.
Well, Mr. Know-It-All, it looks like that wasn't fresh grizzly bear scat we've been seeing on the trail today.
‘He said that he had never actually believed that we existed before now.’
He says since 2016, he doesn't feel all that abominable.
For once, can you just admit I was right?
I don't see why people think being blind takes away from the hiking experience. We aren't missing a thing!
No, it is his brother Abysmal.
He says it's not us..he can't get cell service either.
I told you getting a guide off the internet was risky.
No problem!  He doesn't believe in us either.
Jason has really changed since being on the paleo diet.
He’s the new Secretary of the Interior.
He’s having a wall built and he says we’re paying for it.
The Big Foot is not actually his most notable feature.
He says we don't exist.
...aloof, a bit abrupt, but certainly not abominable.
That was awkward.
I swear, if you say, "Are we there yeti?" one more time....
That reminds me; did you call your Mother?
He  says he's going to a summit meeting.
Nobody will believe him when he says he saw us.
I thought YOU were bringing the camera.
I refuse to have this conversation every time we run into one of my ex boyfriends!
No. I was water bottles. You were camera.
All the brochure said was “Expert Guide.”
He’s blurrier in pictures.
You’re supposed to say ‘Snowperson’.
Balding, orange hair, small paws, thinks he's the King of the mountain . . . . I'm sure it's him.
I'm sorry, Todd.  But he just seems better prepared for what's ahead.
No, I told YOU to bring the camera!
This is not what I expected when they said we'd have a native tour guide.
Seriously! Why is it so hard for you men to ask for directions?!
Quick, give me the grainiest camera you have.
Do you still want to meet others matching your DNA?
Why is it always my "stupid camera" when we leave it in the car?
And Yeti persisted.
See, even he asked for directions!
He said we have to leave. The park is closed.
Way to go, genius! The politically-correct term is 'Sasquatch-American'!
Yeah, like I'm gonna trust the guy who needs a pole to hike up this mountain versus the one who's doing it butt ass naked.
Well, at least HE's not afraid to ask for directions.
He asked me who was President. I told him and he laughed.
We're high, but not that high, are we?
I think this ancestry-DNA search has taken us as far as we want it to
You stare at his ass for the next 5,000 feet if you like. I'm going back to the chalet
I found our sperm donor.
I’m going with him. HE was willing to stop and ask for directions.
Suddenly you look better to me.
He said time waits for snowman.
He said he's going to build a wall and the valley residents are going to pay for it.
That's another "no" for chief of staff.
Would it kill you to ask for directions?
I'm not looking at that hairy butt for the next ten thousand feet!
Great. Today would be the day you forget your camera.
No, you said YOU were going to bring the camera.
If your goal for today was to make a yeti cry, then congratulations Tom....
Well, maybe you should treat him like he exists…
No one is going to believe us! The first blind couple to hike to the peak!
What do you mean you forgot to bring the camera?
NO GEORGE, my nipples are hard because it’s COLD!
Crap, he's lost too.
Furloughed. He works in the park.
I suppose you forgot the camera again.
'Let's live in the moment,' you say...'NO phones, NO cameras'.  Wayda go, Brad."
Time in the Trump White House definitely changes a person.
Fine, if you won’t ask him for directions I will.
He said to "unfollow" him.
He says he will give us each a pair of skis if we sit through a time share presentation.
He said he'd be right back with a non-disclosure agreement.
Yeah, but I never thought I'd see Trump in the White House either.
Remember when you said my camera would be too much extra weight?
He asked if we'd wait here while he gets his video camera.
We haven’t seen a soul in days and now, you’re too proud to ask for directions?!
Why won't you ever ask anyone for directions, Carl?
He finds "abominable" offensive and prefers "snowperson."
Great, the day we decide to 'be present' and leave our smartphones behind!
She's pissed because Everybody thinks she's a male.
His big foot isn't the first thing I noticed.
I don’t think your dad likes me.
The old “Look behind you” joke.  Creative Paul!
Why?  He makes me laugh.  That's why.
Aloof, yes — abominable seems excessive though.
You and your "Let's leave our phones at the lodge."
Quick... Grab the camera that only takes blurry pictures!
He asked that we get off his lawn.
The politically correct phrase is "Hirsute-American"
He said that his mountain is closed because of the government shut down
I was lost. He kept me warm.
He said to wait while he gets his family. They don't believe in Smallfoot.
You go first now, I’m tired of looking at his ass
He says he can’t help us because he doesn’t actually  exist.
The Iceman Leave-ith.
The iceman goeth
We get as far away from New York as we can and, like, literally on the first day, BOOM, celebrity sighting!
He just wanted the WiFi password for the lodge.
You had to ask him right off about evolution?
Too late. He's already signed with Nike.
It's 2019 - the correct term is abominable snowperson
Bigfoot doesn’t believe in you either.
See, easy. I don't get why you men are so scared of asking for directions.
I don't care what he is, we're asking for directions!
Why am I the one who always has to ask for directions?
He says it's only another hundred yards to the summit, but that he wasn't expecting visitors and we should give him a few minutes to straighten the place up.
He wanted to know if we had any weed.
Jesus, Doug, you can't just call someone "abominable"
Don't worry,if it was real it would have footprints.
He's Sasquatch, but he identifies as Yeti.
He’s upset.  He found out what ‘abominable’ means.
If anyone is acting abominable right now it’s you, Brad.
What do you mean, you don't have the camera?!
I really think it’s time to swallow your pride and ask for directions, Steve.
NO, "Are we there yeti?" is NOT a funny joke when he's standing right there!!
Well, I like him.  He doesn't talk about himself all the time.
It would seem more real to me if there were footprints.
You won't believe this, I just saw Steve Bannon in the nude.
Dude. Stop asking 'are we there, Yeti?'
Why are you always afraid to ask for directions?
All he asked was, is Trump still president?”
He has cousins in Oregon.
This happens literally every time I forget my phone.
I could not understand him.  He was talking in Yetish.
Really, Larry? CHEWBACCA?
Quit being so stubborn and ask him for directions!
What happens on K-2,stays on K-2.
Bro, if you aren't sure, use gender neutral pronouns.
He's pretending we don't exist.
You SERIOUSLY did not bring a camera?
Well, Daniel, if you really must know, he said I could do better.
I asked, but he's not from around here.
Abominable yes, but in a good way.
He wants us off his lawn.
He may be abominable but at least he hasn't been complaining the whole trip.
Actually, I expected a female president to appear first.
Oh, like your back is any less hairy.
I guess that wasn’t moose scat.
He was really very nice.  All he wanted was a selfie to prove that humans actually exist.
He said to tell Mr. Trump,he isn't interested in being Attorney General!
He wanted to know if there REALLY is a Donald Trump.
Incredible! He wasn't ashamed to ask for directions.
I know what a Yeti is. It's your mansplaining I find abominable.
Now you want to ask for directions!
Don't you just hate getting passed by someone older than you.
He said he's heading north before there's a wall going into Canada.
I'm sorry John. I've found my missing link.
I showed him the video but he still thinks Trump is a mythical beast.
What’ could possibly be more important than what I have to say?!
I know, but he says he has wi-fi back at his place.
YOU tell him he's off trail.
He said he thought we were a hoax.
What you see on this mountain, stays on this mountain.
We just had coffee, I swear.
If he comes back, just tell him that you meant to say "adorable."
And I thought you had a hairy ass.
I don’t know why they call him abominable. He’s delightful.
Rob! He was just starting to trust us! “Are we there yeti!?” Really?!
I think the acid is kicking in.
Okay, Mr. Mountaineer, now you can tell people even Bigfoot thinks you’re a jerk.
He makes me feel like a natural woman.
He said you’re hallucinating, probably dehydrated, and drink more water.
He wanted to know if we had any Grey Poupon.
He says the restrooms are closed during the shutdown.
He prefers "Differently-Sized Foot."
I asked, “Are we there, Yeti?” but he didn’t even crack a smile.
He just wanted to know if Mueller had completed the investigation yet.
He’s just run back for his camera - I told him we wouldn’t mind waiting.
He said he's trying to find himself
Ask me again in 9 months.
Don't look at me like I don't exist.
I didn't like his altitude.
Aloof, maybe, but abominable?
I'm leaving. And yes, Dan, size does matter.
It's definitely time for the oxygen.
He said he's going to the summit on climate change.
Wow, and to think all this time the legend has been about the size of his foot.
I've met someone.
I don't believe in you either!
I met him on Timber.
Quit trying to make me look.
I'm just dying to ask  'Are we there, Yeti?'
Apparently "yeti" is no longer politically correct.
We have to wait here while they review our asylum request.
He said, "Go back and tell them that my name is NOT Bigfoot, Yeti, or Sasquatch. It's Frank. My name is Frank."
Why is it so hard to just admit when you're lost and ask for directions?
Actually, I'd say more "rude" than "abominable."
Yeti persisted...
Well how much would you have tipped him?
Wow, that was a near myth!
A picture is worth a thousand words only if someone's husband didn't forget the camera !
They never believe him, but he's going to tell his friends he spotted us.
Roger, I'm leaving you. Size matters.
Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps you're the abominable one, Craig?
Maybe you're the abominable one, Gary.
He said he's tired of submitting cartoon captions to the New Yorker and getting rejected ...
NOW you're telling me you forgot the camera?!
He says, “If you were hung like he is, you wouldn’t wear pants either.”
He said: 'You never saw me'
He's looking for a open bathroom since the park has been shut down.....
I don’t know what he wanted, I don’t speak French.
He hasn't seen him, either.
Nudists have had to adapt to the climate up here.
...let's leave our Iphones at the camp site and enjoy nature without any outside distractions."  Well, what a great idea that turned out to be.
He's going to put his clothes on, he didn't know we were up here.
“We’ve been invited up for drinks at six.”
No, he doesn't talk, but he smiled when I called him "Chewbacca."
He thought we were just a myth.
Nice work, now he’s offended. It’s 2019, they are called Abominal Snow PEOPLE.
From now on, I'm in charge of packing the camera.
That wasn't 'black ice' you stepped into on the way up!
Jesus Christ, will you stop following me Greg! I’m with Harry now. It’s time for you to let go.
Gary, I NEVER said back hair was a deal breaker.
He says, no thanks, he's satisfied with his current Internet provider.
I’m not asking for directions! Let’s just follow him, he looks local.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Stop changing the subject again like you did at that lake in Scotland!
I'd rather just follow him on Twitter.
Quick. Go ask if he'll take our picture.
You know how angry it makes me when you don’t look at me when I’m speaking to you.
With Jim and Nancy deep in conversation, yet again, the illusive Yeti escapes unnoticed.
Well, there's a busted myth--he seemed perfectly lovely.
Cool! What's next on your bucket list?
You never liked ANY of my boyfriends!
And you wasted your batteries posting trail pics on Instagram.
And you just couldn't, possibly, have asked him for directions ?
He says he's building a wall, and he wants us to pay for it.
I thought you brought the camera
No Karen, I will not ask him for directions!
That reminds me.  My mother-in-law is coming to visit next week.
Yes, I'm going with him. He's confident, reliable and doesn't carry a custom walking stick!
He said he came down to get his "23 and me" results.
Actually, it's your attitude that I find abominable.
He told us to get off his lawn.
We both listed "like to hike" on our profiles and he's vegan too.
Awkwardly introverted and bit self conscious, but hardly abominable.
He was asking about the Mueller investigation.
JUST ASK FOR DIRECTIONS!
Not to be nitpicky, but I think you're supposed to say, 'Abominable SnowPERSON.'
He says he eats only locally sourced hikers.
Seriously, Chris? Abominable? It's 2019.
He seems more irritable than abominable.
He said if you keep whistling he's going to eat us, and I agree.
He's not coming back down until Trump is impeached.
YOU ask to take a selfie with him!
If you won't ask him for directions, I will.
No, really, Josh.  I think he'd be perfect for your sister.
Downwind is not where to be.
What do you mean he makes you feel inadequate.
Why didn't you ask him for directions?
It’s nothing like that. I just do his hair.
We can digital detox in February, Stu - Gimme the damned iPhone.
He's lost too!
He wolf-whistled me and you just stand there doing nothing?
He's for a free Tibet in theory -- but no donation.
I can't believe you didn't ask him for directions.
Turns out they’re  not that rare.
Oh, now you know better than the locals?
We can still claim First Ascent. No one will believe in him.
There! You hurt his feelings...happy now?
Would it have killed you to call him 'Mister' Bigfoot?
NOW do you believe me?
How come nobody is leaving footprints?
I asked him what the conditions were at the top and all he said was "abominable."
I think we are officially too high now.
And I suppose you're going to say this is all in my head too?
Maybe NOW you’ll ask for directions.
If it weren't for the snow blindness, I'm sure we'd be seeing something amazing right now.
He said that from now on he'd prefer to be known as 'The Somewhat Ill-Tempered Snowperson.'
Bob, I've met someone.
He says we're a figment of his imagination.
Sure, he's abominable, but at least he listens
We must be Really high.
He's up to 12,000 steps.
It’s not just his foot that’s big.
You know what's 'abominable,' Brandon? Your constant need to deflect.
A little surly, sure, but abominable?
So, Yeti's a female!  She asked for directions.
You had to bring up global warming, didn't you?
I’m just saying, I know he was rude, but Abominable seems a bit harsh…”
I've been lying to you,Dave. Size does matter.
Neither of us believe in you, either.
He won't be back. He said that amid the events of 2018 he hardly feels abominable at all anymore.
We can only take a selfie with him if we promise the photo will be blurry and out of focus.
I guess not everyone needs a $300 European trekking pole, Julian.
He said you can take pictures of his tracks but anything else and you’ll be hearing from his lawyers.
I never thought this ancestry thing would take us this far.
This is the last Airbnb I let you book.
He doesn’t know we exist either!
He called me Snowflake, Roger. Are you going to let him get away with that?
Well if that's how you feel maybe you shouldn't have put "adventurous" in your profile
He said a picture is fine. He just needs to throw on some pants and grab a release form.
This tour guide is an absolute legend.
He muttered, 'There goes the neighborhood".
Since we're lost, this might not have been the best time to share that  you don't believe in his existence.
We got our selfie. Now let's go before we miss the plane to Loch Ness.
Now we're losing him. You just had to make one more prefrontal cortex joke, didn't you?
What do I have to do to get you to ask for directions?
Stop trying to change the subject...
He's also moving to Canada.
Damn it. Quit saying there's a Yeti behind
me because I will not fall for that again and again!
Let’s leave our phones in the car,” you said
He's abominable, Gary? We've been listening to you whine about your sinuses since base camp.
He wouldn’t stop talking about “An Inconvenient Truth.”
What do you mean you forgot the camera!?
Nobody says good morning anymore.
Yes, I'm sure those wild mushrooms were fine. Why?
Mansplain THAT!
Surprisingly, he has less back hair than you.
He’s said I looked nothing at all like my Tinder profile.
Why do you always have to bring up politics as soon as we meet someone?
Well, there goes the best guide ever. I TOLD you he wouldn’t want to be in your selfie!
Of course you think it’s a ‘he.’
He's not abominable, he's French.
He does look like Chewbacca!”
“You didn’t have to say that to his face.
Oh my god it's a small world. He knows Sasquatch!
I'm sorry Brandon, but I needed to find out if what they say about big feet is true
Oh, Harold. It was nothing, a one time thing. On a totally different mountain.
I'm thinking of stopping shaving my legs.
It makes me wonder what else I've missed while endlessly staring at my phone.
A rarer sighting would be you committing to me.
He says he doesn't want to be Chief of Staff.
Yeah,yeah,yeah,I'm sure the YETI is behind me.  I'm not falling for that line again!
He just needed to borrow my chapstick.
The tour book did say that our guide would be a natural climber.
Well you can't just call someone "abominable" before you get to know them.
He said, "Sorry, I'm a tourist here myself".
Oh just ASK
I said are we there?”He said “Not Yeti.
Please stop saying "ladies first".
Good news--he says there IS cell service at the top!
Aren't we supposed to wait until he's far away and indiscernible, before we take a picture?
I thought you had the camera.
It looked like him, but it wasn’t him.
I already told you, Gary, he’s just a friend from college.
No, he said it wasn't him.
He said  the restaurant at the top is worth the effort.
He said "summit" is a noun, not a verb.
I found him to be very bominable, actually
His hands are tiny.
Because he is everything you are not!
At least I´m not too stubborn to ask directions.
Now look what you've done! You don't smell so great after 4 days in the woods either. Now go apologize to him!
He's depressed. No one believes in him any more.
I asked him “Are we there Yeti?”  Apparently he doesn’t like puns.
Yes, I'm leaving you. He's just so comfortable in his own skin.
He said a sitting president can be indicted.
Nevermind that. Why has the cartoonist neglected drawing in the footprints?
Compared to all the others, our guide is a legend.
Just ask him for directions already!
When I said bring the YETI I meant the cooler.
I thought you said it would just be the two of us this time...
He says enough already. Both he and climate change are real.
I say we pass him. It's no picnic being downwind from Big Foot.
You're not changing the subject, we're going to talk about why it's been 5 years and you haven't proposed!
Abominable Snow MAN"?! Now go apologize to her right now
Yet he...?  Yet he, WHAT?
I don't care how famous he is, just ask him for directions
All I said was I thought he’d be a lot taller in person.
You were right,it is worth it to get a local guide.
He prefers to be called Larger-than-Average Foot.
It's a North Face onesie.
He says he's not coming down until after the 2020 elections.
You can only ask “Are we there Yeti?” so many times.
Amazing news! He's going to get us the wifi password.
I'm sorry, but I think he will keep me warmer tonight than you can.
Of course—ask the ten-foot-tall male for directions. To hell with my map, right?
Turns out we’ve strayed onto private property.
Look at me when I’m talking to you, Harold.
'SnowPERSON'
Pleasant guy; very opinionated about global warming
He says it's a clothing optional peak.
See?! I told you that your non-stop yodeling was annoying.
All he said was that ‘abominable’ is derogatory, and kept walking
What? All I said was that I thought his feet would have been bigger.
Well maybe he thinks you're abominable.
He says we’re lost
Jimmy really went paleo!
Next time I hire the guide.
He wanted to borrow a phone charger.
I agreed to help him continue the species
The first sign of oxygen deprivation is hallucinating.
I asked.  No selfies.
You’re really going to mansplain a Yeti to me right now?!?!
That explains all the yellow snow!
Well, he's cheaper than the last guide and he really seems to know his way around!
Sasquatch? you call a Yeti a Sasquatch? How do you expect him to react?
He says he won't seat us until the rest of our party arrives.
O.K., you win. But I still don't believe in seahorses.
Yes, Helen, I'm well aware of what they say about the size of a man's foot.
All I said was, "Yeti or not?" Apparently he's heard that one before.
Very funny, you had to ask him if he knew Chewbacca!
It’s over Jim, I live on the mountain with Satch now.
He said wait here, we can take a picture, but he wants to get his hat first.
How was I supposed to know that Yeti is now a derogatory term?
So what if he gets there first?  Who's he gonna to tell?
Go ahead and laugh....you can't even grow a decent mouscache!
Why are you so surprised?  I told you I had family in the area.
I think we're going to need another pronoun.
He asked how the Jets did this season, then just shook his head and walked away.”
Of course I didn't look.
I'm leaving you for someone I can believe in .
Don't worry... I gave him a fake number.
No, I think you better use ’they/them’.
He went back to get his camera
Don't be jealous, Dave. How could I know he'd be up here?
Where exactly did you hire our guide?
He prefers the term 'Hirsute Snowman.'
Two young people doing an activity outdoors without taking a selfie- he said he thought that was only a myth!
You just had to go and mention you voted for Trump, didn't you?
He says to walk quietly because they are having a poetry reading.
He says he does not identify as "abominable."
He says that he'd like to have us for dinner.
The only thing "abominable" on this mountain is your attitude towards meeting new people!
I don’t think he’s going to give the camera back.
I've made up my mind.  I want someone more authentic.
Exactly where did you find this guide?
I'm sorry Derrick, this is my chance to walk on the wild side.
Turns out it's pronounced "Yet-Tie"
He said the Summit Gift Shop is closed but the cafe is still open.
No!  I didn't have the camera.  I thought you had the camera...
A little obnoxious but I wouldn’t say abominable.
Well, Bill, I guess this is goodbye.
Apparently, no one has ever called him 'abominable' before.
All I said was, "Trump."
Did you hear that?  'Tourists!'  The smug ape called us tourists!
I can't believe you left the camera in the car.
Ugh, it's so like him to show up and then just leave.
You're always trying to change the subject...we need to talk about US!
You're following in some pretty big footsteps.
You could at least have asked for directions!
He's offended you called him "abominable" because he self-identifies as "adorable."
It's not the size of his feet I found impressive.
A three-way with a Yeti is on your bucket list, Paul, not mine.
Dinner’s at 7 but his agent booked a last minute sighting so he might be a touch late.
Well, he does seem to know the way, Allen.
Relax, I said no.
Irascible, unforgettable, but not abominable
I don't care if he's your friend... if he's going to hike with us he needs to wear pants!
No, I haven't seen Steve Bannon. Why do you ask?
Thanks to the governmental parks shutdown, even Big Foot is  unemployed.
He said, "No cash, no selfie."
He's not anti-social, he just needs to pee.
He said it’s no fun anymore. Everybody’s abominable.
Blame the cold all you want, Richard. His was obviously bigger.
He said something about trying to find himself.
He says he needs to go off and find himself, for once.
Do you know if altitude sickness can cause hallucinations?
There's never a good time to say this, Phil...
Really? All you have to say is that he looks a little bit like my uncle Fred?
Hang on a sec .... he's going to grab his selfie stick.
After you....
I thought you packed the camera.
You were supposed to pack the camera!
He said if anyone should be called 'abominable' it's people like us who drink pumpkin spice lattes and drive a Prius."
Bigfoot’s got small hands.
He’s more expensive than other guides, but he knows these mountains like the back of his hand.
He wants us to stop yodeling.  He says he is trying to hibernate.
So our Airbnb host seems cool.
For once, I agree with you - maybe we shouldn't ask for directions.
Just ask! I'm sure it wouldn't be his first selfie.
C’mon, he said if we follow him he’ll “make us dinner.”
You had to call him Bigfoot? Seriously? This 2019!
I guess we'll have to go back. He says the hiking trail is closed because of the shutdown.
You're not supposed to call them 'abominable' anymore.
He wants to go where snowman has gone before.
'Abominable' is a slur, Jim. It's 2019.
We're nearly the first blind people ever to climb Everest!
He just took my water bottle because it has his name on it.
I haven't seen Jerry since high school. Shame, he really let himself go.
Of course I didn’t ask for a photo together - he must get that all the time.
You're the one who requested an authentic mountain guide!
He's unimpressed with his first human sighting.
"Were you expecting Julie Andrews?!
Are we really going to argue about this now? If it's on a mountain, it's a Yeti, not a Sasquatch!
Why won't you ever ask for directions?
He'll be back in a minute - he forgot his phone.
I thought he'd never leave.
Didn’t the doctor say the altitude medicine could have some weird side effects...?
He wasn’t the friendliest snowman I’ve ever met, but abominable seems a bit harsh.
You really didn't know 'abominable' is an insulting term?
I'm just wild about Hairy.
Call me in an hour, in case things get weird. Then I’ll have an excuse to bail.
He says our small one-toed footprints are scaring his children.
Well, you dont look so great naked either.
He said we should have called first.
This WOULD happen when we agree to hike without our phones.
They're an Abominable Non-Binary Snowperson, Doug.
No,YOU ask him for direction!
I don't think so Tom, Yetis are blurrier than that.
No, Derek, you're the one who was being abominable.
And I was like 'Yeah, right. And I'm the missing link!'
In his case, big feet just means big feet.
He said he is not abominable, just misunderstood.
When he goes high, we go low.
He says go away. The peak is closed due to the government shutdown.
He told me he identifies as a Yeti.
The only abominable part of this situation is your unwillingness to ask for directions
A selfie?! You asked him for a selfie?!
So he's abominable. Who are you to talk?
He admitted to cranky, but denied being abominable.
Chewbacca? Seriously, Neil. Get a life."
he said he's making the Himalayas great again...
I've found someone.
Because he's not obsessed with manscaping, that's why!
Call it one more time. He thinks he dropped the phone on this side of the mountain.
He's going back to tell his tribe we're real
Just this once, could you forget you're a guy, and please ask directions?
Well, you finally got to meet my ex.
I've hiked the Canadian Rockies but this is my first time in Sasquatchewan.
Admit it. We're lost!
Are you lost, too? I’m just following that guy... He seems to know the area.
Don't bother.  Nobody will believe you and it will really screw up your career.
Yes, Kevin. It’s goodbye. Size does matter.
I didn't bring the camera, I thought you brought the camera!
He will show us around, but he said no selfies.
Goodbye, Todd. He may be abominable, but at least he’s a good listener.
Next time, you pick the tour guide.
We're just friends.
You're just not out-doorsy enough for me Gerald."
He took a selfie with me, he said to show his friends.
Well who else should we ask for directions?
No, Bigfoot is the one in the forests. Look what you did - now he’s upset.
He’s abominable alright but I’ll take that over needy any day.
Let him cool off.  Now that he knows people are real he needs a moment to adjust.
He isn't real and I am not going to turn around.
And that’s exactly why it’s important to ask their prounouns before assuming.
I gotta go.  My boyfriend doesn’t like me talking to strangers.
Did he invite us over to dinner or over for dinner?
So he's a hairy beast, big deal.  He still should say hi when someone says hi to him."
Well sometimes you can be abominable too, Chad!
Brett's really committed to paleo this year.
Its true what they say about big feet. I’m going with him.
For the last time, Melvin, NOTHING HAPPENED!!!
He may be abominable, but you are being insufferable.
So now you’re jealous of a man who’s yet to fully evolve?
He says he goes down to the valley once in a while to check on a B & B and gastro-pub he co-owns.
Why would you assume he knows Big Foot? Don't you know how offensive that is?
He said it's pronounced 'Yay-tea'.
He might be abominable, Brad, but at least he's going to make it to the top
He’s more ambivalent than abominable.
"I don't care if you think he doesn't exist, I'm following him."
I'll tell you what's abominable, Stu.  Your attitude.
Sorry you had to find out this way.
He's more of a primate than you'll ever be.
You just had to INSIST we didn't bring our iPhones on this hike, didn't you?
Well, that was anticlimactic.”
He threw my walking stick off the mountain and whispered, "No one will ever believe you."
Look, he gets me and you don't.
He's abominable, not deplorable.
They turned him back at the border.
Abominable? I actually found him quite adorable!
He asked us to tell the world that his feet are proportionate to the rest of his body -- and that his name is Ralph.
Dale!  Are you going to let him talk to me like that?!
He says he'll retire when they find somebody who can fill his shoes.
I'm leaving you, Henry. If I have to settle for an abominable man, it might as well be the real thing.
No...he hasn't seen one either!
Who knew the word "abominable" was offensive?
He isn’t giving us back our cameras. He said he doesn’t want his family all over social media.
What do you mean you forgot to pack a camera?
Wow, his carbon footprint is tiny!
Well, we did agree we'd both see other people.
Yup, turns out it’s true what they say about a man with a big foot.
At least HE's willing to ask directions
It’s not what you think
He’s just a friend
No one will believe you anyway
Damnit, Jim - you NEVER want to ask for directions!
Let him win.
I’m telling you, he’s just the type of outsider the DNC is looking for.
I'm not racist. Some of my best friends are abominable.
You’re a nice guy, Doug, but my taste in men has always been abominable.
He wants to find himself.
He's just a better fit for the life I want to lead.
You can be pretty abominable sometimes too, Tad.
You didn't tell me we were coming to meet your parents.
Let’s respect his self-identification as gender-fluid and use the term “snow-person.”
He said to make sure the photos of him are really blurry
No one will ever believe we forgot our phones.
Are you sure the sign said this hike was good for "abdominals."
But I'm still right about Loch Ness
He says our big carbon footprint scares him.
He's the least abominable thing in my life right now.
He's not so abominable when you get to know him.
He's abominable until he's had his coffee.
He says the "y" is silent.
Abominable? Quite the contrary, I found him perfectly delightful.
Apparently people tell him that all the time.
I guess we are on the Evolutionary Path!
I'm going with him. You can keep the kids.
You ALWAYS complain when I ask for directions!!
Let's just ask for directions!
I'm sorry, Jason, but size does matter.
Sorry Larry. Size matters.
I told him the park bathrooms are still closed.
Shouldnt it be Big Feet?
He asked me if I’ve seen his pants.
I’m not sure what he meant, but he mumbled something about needing to build a wall.
It's your turn to ask for directions.
He doesn't look anything like his picture.
You just had to go and talk about his feet, didn't you.
He says he's in the Witness Protection Program.
He wanted the WiFi password.
He said we can take his picture, but to wait until he's far away so that it will be really grainy.
I think that's the new one piece from The North Face
I told you that stupid wall wouldn't work
Strange...he kept muttering, 'No collusion, no collusion, no collusion', as he walked by!
I don’t care if he’s the last of his kind, if you’re not going to tell him we’re lost, I will.
He said he thinks  WE’RE abominable.
He wanted $20 for the selfie.
Small world; his cousin was our tour guide in the Pacific Northwest.
I won't be needing you now.
He says it's available but we have to book through Airbnb.
You can’t just ASK someone if they’re BIGFOOT!
Abominable, really? You couldn't just call him Yeti?
That's Dad.  He'll warm up after you spend time with him.
Why don't you ever believe me?
He says he doesn't want to hear the good news about Jesus.
You had to mention the feet.
You just will not ask directions.
He's not so abominable once you get to know him.
How much do we tip him?
You call our guide abominable, and you’re surprised he walks out on us?
You're not going to believe me, but I think I just saw your ex-wife.
We came to a meeting of the minds.  He said to get off his mountain and  I said OK.
You’re going to let him say that to me?
Let me get this straight - your main concern is that I'm incorrect in using the term Big Foot?
Of course we can't keep up with him... That guy's a legend!
He's right, I have to choose. Goodbye, Mark.
Another newby...no gear, no backpack and not even sunglasses.
He wouldn’t stop for a selfie. Said he was having a bad hair day.
It's obviously much easier without a pack.
Of course you hurt his feelings! Who wants to be called Abominable! It's Yeti! Yeti!!
I DID pitch him. He said he hates the genre,  your co-star idea, and is holding out for a name director.
He said nowadays he considers himself more woke than abominable
You seriously asked him what the wi-fi password is up here?
No, YOU ask him.
I TOLD you not to waste your cell phone battery on selfies!
I think the correct term is Abominable Snowperson.
No, I wasn't flirting with him - 23&me says he's my cousin.
He says we’re too loud.
I want to start seeing other hominidae
Yeah, well he's twice the man you'll ever be!
I don't care--he's still electable.
He doesn’ know the way either.
But you complained the last guide talked too much!
I told you we were too high...
No, Jason...the $165 you spent on that trekking pole you'll never use again...that's abominable.
He's gone to tell all the other Bigfoots that we really do exist.
You think he's abominable. I think he's warm and fuzzy.
What?! He needed directions.
He said if we keep his secret, he'll validate our parking.
Well, "it" said 'me no do directions, but you follow- have short cut', so Yes, I am sure it is male.
YOU never tell me how good I look without make-up,
He's going to go build a wall to keep us out
How would you like to be called the abominable hiker? His name is Dave.
You don't need to get all weird about it. I told him I wasn't interested.
He’s your friend. You tell him to cut back on the paleo diet.
No, what’s “abominable” is your xenophobia.
The size of his hands and feet should tell you why I dumped you! Or do you want to know more?
I've decided I'm going with him--he couldn't be more abominable than you.
The one time you tell me to put my phone down.
He said real men don't use walking sticks.
He'll be back in a minute. Just gone to get his camera.
'...honest, it's nothing...we're just friends.'
He says we missed a trail marker about a mile back.
He's depressed.  Says he once was at the very top of the "Fake News" charts!
He's climbing every mountain till he finds his dream.
Yet he what?
I’m not saying you’re stalking me but you have to admit it is a pretty big coincidence to find you here on my third Yeti date.
He said that the tea room is closed for the season and the gift shop is sub-par, so I say we try K2.
You wouldn't believe the things we've seen here since the government shutdown
He doesn't know how far to the top. He's on vacation too.
They prefer the term "yetx."
Just pack my camera, I said! Just pack my camera!  Even he thinks you're an idiot
No, I left my camera at home - why?
Indomitable, abominable - whatever. At least he doesn’t nitpick like you.
I'm invited to a party at his chateau, but I need to 'lose the geek'.
He'll be right back.  He forgot his phone.
Did you think he was abominable? I thought he was sort of nice.
Seriously?!  You forgot your camera?
He says he’ll be back to chat after he gets in his 10,000 steps
He has really little hands.
Yeah right, I’m not falling for that again
He explicitly said "no autographs" and you thought a selfie would be fine?
Either Sasquatch or Yeti is fine. But don't ever tell him his feet are big.
I thought you said you were bringing an imaginary friend!
Is everyone on Paleo this cranky?
"It's eerie to see him in the wild and not tweeting."
I'm just saying it wouldn't hurt you to be more like him.. strong, self-sufficient, a little bohemian.
He's crude,rude,lewd and on the way up.
I have an idea, lets make him president.
No pictures. Both of us vowed to be more present this year.
We're in luck, he said tourists are too salty.
He's a great guide but his people skills are abominable
He wanted directions to “Sasquatchewan”
You were the only one being abominable just now, Steve!
Why didn't you just ask him for directions?
The tour guide really seems at home up here
I've been such a fool, Bob. I'm back. Can you ever forgive me?
You and your stupid Dad jokes, no we aren't "there Yeti!"
He said we shouldn't have spent so much money on Gore-Tex
Quit following me! I told you I’m with him now.
He's a great guide, but he's not much for conversation.
Flip a coin to see whose tent he shares?
Why can't you just ask directions,Keith?!
Why can’t we ever go out, just the two of us, Harold?
I told you he wouldn't believe in us.
Hard to miss....looks like it is true what they say about big feet.
All I said was that we think he’s a myth.
I thought he was with you.
The one time we leave our phones in the car.
Sorry Dave, but you know what they say--big foot..."
You just had to mention his feet!
We need to go back to the crevasse and take a left.
He says he isn't abominable, just antisocial.
The one time we decide to leave our cell phones behind!..,
I guess the Ice Man cometh and goeth.
He said conditions up ahead are abominable.
I asked if I could follow him, but he said he's off Twitter.
Don't just stand there, make him give me my camera back.
He seemed cold to me.
I thought his feet would be bigger.
Apparently, it IS lonely at the top.
He's not as abominable in person.
You meet the same people on the way down as you do on the way up.
I’m sorry Brett. It’s been an amazing journey, but I just have to follow my heart.
I’m going with him, he doesn’t need to stop all the time to ask for directions!
Well that was a little anti-climatic. We still don't know the meaning of life.
I can't explain it.  It just happened.
'Let's unplug,' he says. 'Who needs phones on hikes?' he says. Bigfoot dammit! People who see Bigfoot need phones on hikes!
Mostly grumbling but I thought I heard something about climate change.
He'll be right back; he forgot to feed the cat.
Everything was fine till you made that manscaping crack.
From here on it gets a bit hairy.
Dad! You promised you would be nice to him!
It only gets hairier from here on out.
Yet I like him.
Well maybe you should think before you call someone abominable!
He made a pass at me and you DID NOTHING ?!!
Next time I get to choose a guide.
No, Jason...the $250 you spent on that trekking pole...that's abominable.
Please, make it  stop. He's been singing "valderee valdera" since  base camp.
Yes, he says they only kill the ones on snowboards
I just feel like you're missing the big picture here.
I told you he was the best guide if you want to avoid the crowds.
OK, so it's Big Foot not a yeti. You really know how to spoil a moment don't you.
He has to go back up. He thinks he left his iPhone at the summit.
He's a local
If you think his FEET are big ...
He said he doesn't believe in us
We look like tourists.
You promised, no nude resorts this year.
I told him I was looking for a more evolved guy.
I asked him if he was a Yeti and he said ‘Not yeti’.
Thanks, Brad, I'll take it from here.
He wanted to know if Donald Trump was still president.
Great. Next on the bucket list is Hoffa.
He said he's going to Starbucks and asked if we wanted anything.
So what if he is?  Did you have to call him Abominable to his face?
It’s over, John. I’m going to follow my heart.
he asked me to join the mile high club.  I told him that was an urban legend.
I didn't see HIM using a GPS
He may be abominable, but at least he listens to me!
You are not paying attention to me.
He’s way less blurry than I imagined.
He says we're trespassing.
Sorry, Jorge, but size does matter. A lot.
He wanted to know if America was great again.
He mumbled something about "the wall"  and kept going
So many doubt his existence--he just needed to feel validated.
I'm starting to think he's not a sherpa.
Like I said, it gets a little hairy near the top.
He's just going to get his camera so he can take a selfie with us."
He seemed nice.
Yes, I asked for directions. We were lost!
He said he was going back up until Trump gets impeached.
You're abominable... He's harmless.
No, YOU ask him if he wants to take a selfie.
Abominable, yeti find him intriguing.
I told you five times: the proper ethnic description is 'substantially-footed American'.
I'm sorry, John.  I have to follow my heart.
That nice hairy man said he would like to have us over for dinner tonight.
I asked if we were near the summit, and he said, ‘Not yeti.’
When you said we'd have a local guide, I didn't understand just how local you meant.
Of course I'm leaving you. Look at those feet.
They were out of Sherpas.
Larry I’m sorry ! Size does matter
It’s not you, it’s him.
OUR relationship is abominable, Bob. I'm going with him.
He's a little touchy about the A-word.
No internet connection! There is no point to any of this if we can't post it to social media!
She says that her children don't believe that there is such a thing as a human.  Would you mind?  It would only take a minute.
Don't wait up.
I was told it’s a great hike but with all this cloud cover there’s  just not anything that interesting to see.
He said that  “closing the parks was an abomination”.
I still think we should have asked for directions
Really? You had to use the 'a' word?
He said to count to ten and try to find him again.
We met in college. He's just a friend.
This is humiliating for us. I bet he never even trained.
Wow. I always assumed that Bigfoot was a male.
Will you just ask for directions already!
He’s the Deplorable Snowman, and wants to Make Mt. Everest Great Again.
No, I agree with him - it’s your attitude that’s abominable
He seemed nice but he didn't know anyone who went to Yale.
Again, his name is Edwin and he identifies as POST-human.
You had to go and call him abominable, didn’t you?
He called me an abominable human being!
See what?
He knows a great ramen place.  And there's no wait."
Not Yeti was a perfectly appropriate pun.
I told you not to mention his small hands!
And Yet . . . I no longer find him abominable.
No, not a word. Just the cold shoulder.
Oh, he was just asking if it was 2020 yet.
Yes, the Ice Man has cometh.
Yes he is abominable and you voted for him...
Can we leave our phones behind and connect with nature for once?"
Good call Marty
He’s your uncle; you tell him to put some clothes on.
Next time, you get the guide!
Okay, you're right. Everybody goes to Davos now.
Oh yeah? Well, you wouldn't notice if a Yeti walked by!
Says he's headed back to a more civil society.
He's not the guy. He says his name is 'Yeto'.
He said our footprint is bigger than his is now.
'Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints,' was NOT what I was expecting.
Stop interrupting!! For you, there's never a good time to discuss our relationship!
He says the wait for the summit is about 20 minutes, and suggests we relax in the bar.
He said, "Don't tell anyone you saw me."
Got anymore mushrooms?
He was hoping we could give him directions.
Oh really, Carl? What's more likely, that Bigfoot's standing behind me, or that I'm very high and we're standing in a Wendy's?
It said we're just a figment of its imagination.
Great...now we have to have lunch with him!
That whole "abominable" thing is no longer PC.  Can we just go with "Alpine Hominid"?
He said he would like to be known as the “somewhat disturbing snowman”
You were supposed to bring the camera!
You just had to use the A-word, didn’t you?
He said I could do better if I didn’t shave my legs.
We’re wasting our time. I haven’t seen even one footprint.
He was more interesting before he came out.
Yeah, I'm freezing, too! We should have sprung for the PolarFleece Xtreme suit like Gary did.
next time...I pick the guide!
I'd say he's pretty terrible, but not abominable.
One more time---we broke up  years ago
Are you sure this was the guide we booked on Travelocity?
Let's just say that her 23andMe results didn't come back as expected.
He says to avoid the latrine at Camp 4.
He prefers "they" and thought "abominable" was very judgmental
This isn't what I meant when I asked for a local guide.
He was mainly complaining about his abominable wife.
He said, if he's so abominable, find yourself another sherpa, pal.
Yeah, Bob, he may be abominable but he's not deplorable like you.
‘Abominable’? Really? Go apologize.
She got offended when I called her the Abominable Snow-MAN
That reminds me. You need to go in for another back waxing.
Ask him what the Wi-Fi password is.
What did you expect after draining the swamp?
He said he's with National Geographic.
Well let's just follow that guy then, he seems to know where he's going.
More like the apathetic snowman to me
'Hire a sherpa,' I said. 'Let's go a little native,' you said.
He's twice the man you'll ever be.
No! I'm going to ask for directions!
I guess it's true what they say about big feet.
Not to intimidate you, but you have some big shoes to fill.
Seriously?  In Aspen?
I'm not saying we've been climbing for ages, but he was entirely clean-shaven when we started.
He says the view is not worth the climb.
You know, it’d be a lot easier to find Bigfoot if we weren’t blind.
Call him abominable all you like. I'm still leaving you.
You're entitled to your opinion, but I think he's adorable.
The heart wants what it wants.
Good bye, Grayson.
We dated in college.
Is it possible that we are in a car insurance commercial?
I don’t miss a thing hiking blind, do you?
He's not abominable, he's just a Republican.
Melania finally did divorce him
No-- it's average size  .
He wanted to know if we were developers.
Abominable? No. I think he just lacks People skills. Let's press on.
He insists he’s not.
Can you believe it? He acted like he doesn’t even know us.
The summit is closed due to the government shutdown
Sorry Jerome, in this environment, size does matter!
He says he gets that a lot.
He wondered why women always have to be the one asking for directions.
For the last time - don't call him that. He is very sensitive about his foot size
I can in fact confirm that we are standing downwind.
I'm sorry Ted, I'm leaving you for a real whatever he is.
That was really insensitive, John.
He just said "Yeti, set go!" and took off.
Really? I thought his English was pretty good, considering.
You could've asked for directions.
I said he was evolving. Not that he and I were involved.
He said dinner is at 7:00, and 'all paleo' is just a stereotype.
I told you. He's sick of hearing about Trump.
Look, he's local & says he knows a good coffee place. I thought we agreed to 'not be tourists' on this trip...
They won't believe us if we don't have a selfie.
He just wanted to make sure that we knew that this is a clothing optional mountain.
I'm leaving with him. And no, it has nothing to do with the size of his feet.
I forgot the camera.
Oh God, do you think he saw us?
He said he thought we were unsubstantiated sightings
You know, he was actually kinda bominable.
He asked if we'd seen any abominable snow women in the vicinity.
OK, have it your way. You saw a yeti.
Calling him abominable Jeffrey, doesn’t change the fact that he’s still  president
You heard him, Jim. We're just going to stop at his cave for a quick lunch and then we'll be on our way.
He was just wondering if my boots come in a 26-E.
He said that Donald Trump is a con man and its obvious that he had conspired with Russia to rig the 2016 election. He's optimistic because he can see how sharp and tough Nancy Pelosi is and he hopes to see the entire Trump family put in jail.
I haven'seen him since college.
If I have to settle for cold and emotionless, I’ll go with the Yeti.
Yes, Galen, I'm going with him. His empathetic listening skills and his willingness to forsake the negative din of social media are powerfully compelling inducements to cave dwelling.
He's grouchy ; but he  runs an outstanding bed and breakfast.
Size does matter.
Please make your father put some pants on!
He said he can’t take our picture. Something about the federal furlough.
I'm pregnant.
Sure, his manners aren't perfect. But abominable?
What did you say to him?
He may be abominable, but you're just a jerk.
Apparently, mistaking Yeti for Sasquatch is a no-no.
I can’t believe you’re leaving me for him. You made me shave everything!
So What.  It's fur, and I want it.
He said we're overdressed.
Just for once can I ask for directions?
He understands me. That’s why!
You know, it might just be the altitude.
He happens to be very sensitive about his appearance, but you wouldn't know anything about that would you.
What if I DO think his butt's cuter than yours?
Due to climate change, we're seeing a lot more yettis this time of the year.
I 'm sorry Hans, he's just more equipped.
Great. Now we've lost our guide.
Go ahead.  You always wanted a man cave.
...But you had to have a no phone rule!
Oh my God! It's not a myth! It's true what they say about big feet!
He asked if I knew if there were any good reason to go down into civilization.
He says he's been designated acting interior secretary.
I said it a dozen times on the way up. He’s Abominable, not Deplorable!
So much for solitude.
This is the LAST time you pick the guide!
He called US the abominable ones.
We see celebrities all the time in New York, what's the big deal here?
He said he wants a guaranteed $655 per day, $2,272 per week, 3.6% of distributor's gross receipts for television/cable, and, for video discs, 4.5% of the first million sold and 5.4% thereafter. Call his agent tomorrow when you are ready to sign.
It's pretty hairy going up.  Coming down not so much.
Did you really have to ask him for a selfie?
Yeti, she persisted...
He might be abominable but at least he's willing to take our relationship to the next level.
At least he listens to me.
He's not making foot prints because he's an illusion. What's our excuse?
He looks like someone we could ask for directions
I found him quite pleasant, not abominable at all.
I  wouldn't bother going all the way up. He says its lonely at the top.
He said if we wanted a guru, we've climbed the wrong mountain.
He didn’t like my calling him Herr Suit.
I.m leaving because at least HE isn't going to spend years figuring out if he wants to go back to graduate school or finally start a family.
I'll tell you what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to go back down this damn hill and tell everyone I saw..."BIGFOOT"!
What do you mean you forgot the camera Brad!
Look, we can't give a dollar to everyone!
Well, now I feel overdressed.
Now that’s a snowsuit.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I must leave you because I've come to realize that size does matter.
When you texted, "Yeti digress," was there supposed to be a comma?
He could have asked for directions. Yeti didn't.
What do you have against asking for directions?
He says that they're building a wall but we'll have to pay for it.
Are you sure it's not him? Let me see that photo again.
Don't ask don't tell.
He's getting a fourth for bridge.
Don't be so jealous.  Sometimes big feet mean just that.
He’s in training.  Full ride next year at Alabama.
He didn't seem all that abominable.
What do you mean you FORGOT to charge the camera?
He took my picture!
Yet he persists
He said he can't wait to tell his friends he met a real compassionate conservative in the wild.
He said the "abominable" thing is just a racist stereotype
I suddenly find you inadequate as a man.
For the eighth time, it’s abominable, not abdominal.
Definitely not 'abominable.' He was actually quite pleasant
He said we could post a photo as long as we don’t tag him.
Not only does he have a big foot...
He's pretty upset. He said he spotted me but no one believed him.
He was trying to seek asylum. Bad timing! Poor guy.
That's just great, Tom! You can find an imaginary snow beast but you still can't find the courage to get me a ring.
It's not a yeti, it's Bigfoot, and he's as lost as we are.
'Abominable?' Really? It's 2019, Jim.
He said we could take a selfie with him, but first he had to get dressed.
It’s disheartening to learn that people don’t believe in you.
He told me to go back down - there is nothing to see here...
Yes, Michael, for the umpteenth time, I do think our guide does know what he's doing!"
Here's my idea: you follow him while I leave.
He said 'No one's going to believe me when I tell them I saw you.'
I can't help myself, Stan. There's just something about Hairy.
Footprints, no I don't recall seeing any footprints.  Why?
He my be abominable but he still has feelings.
Bigfoot is a no good, hairy vagrant who contributes nothing to -- he's right behind me, isn't he?
I told him that we already had plans for dinner.
You're imagining things.  I'm not seeing anyone else.
He's not exactly abominable...more like an antisocial climber.
He is a last minute hire during the government shut down....Parks sent him over....
Have you ever thought about growing a beard?
John, that man isn't wearing any pants.
I'm sorry, but foot size really does matter.
At least he knows where he’s going...”
It’s not you, John. I just like hairy men.
...f**kin' tourists...
O.M.G.  I thought you said you were going hiking with Betty!
"You've  gone and hurt his feelings. Why did you have to mention the size of his hands?"
How gullible do you think I am. I am blind,Karen, not stupid
Closed, and he is on furlough.
This tour guide is unbelievable.
It's all right, he says he is just a hallucination caused by low oxygen.
He’s our Uber to the summit.
He’s really not much for conversation but for 50 bucks, he’ll let you take a selfie with him at the summit.
Once, again, no camera!
What can I say, I have primitive taste.
I don't know if he was insulted by "Abominable" or "Snowman".
He said he was still with Trump no matter what the Mueller report says.
He said, " You  don't know what it means to be lost "
Yes! Fondue at his place...and you said the locals were cold and distant.
He prefers Indomitable to Abominable... .  And, most of all  he hates being called  Abdominal.
He said we're going the wrong way.."
What? All I meant was, proportionally, his feet aren't that large.
Would it kill him to wear underwear.
I don't know.  I don't speak Yetish.
You just had to call him "abominable.
Jimmy, I'm sorry, but you know what they say about big feet.
I'm beginning to think this guy's not a real Sherpa
he said there's a Starbuck's just a bit further up.
Of course he’s upset! How would you feel if I went around calling you ‘big nose’?
He said we should close our eyes, count to 100, then try to find him.
So what’s the big surprise you have for me?
Yes, he is abominable!  But he has good health insurance and he. adores Ruth Bader Ginsberg!
I hope you're still proud of your "tech-free" vacation!
No, no, that's just Big Dave.  He's been running the nudist colony up the hill for about a decade now.
My ex. He is abominable.
And get this, he's got a hot spot for internet.
He said no photos - he’s still unhappy about the whole “abominable “ thing.
Yet he left
I told him it's just a legend, but he wants to check for himself.
See, even Sasquatch will stop and ask for directions!
I don't like where this is going.
Though I warned him not to continue, Yeti persisted.
He may be abominable, but at least he puts the seat down.
He asked if we'd encountered anything unusual on the way up. I said not yeti and he took off in a huff.
Sorry, Tim.  Turns out he's totally bominable.
So much for the legend - his feet seem perfectly proportional to me.
Of course he’s upset. ‘Sasquatch’ is a slur! The proper term is ‘Hirsute-American.’
I know. But he says he knows a short cut.
He's a lot less expensive than a Sherpa.
No more arguing, I'm asking directions
Well if you don’t want me to ask for directions then don’t lose the map next time.
He said he's actually the sweet one in the family but that his brother IS quite abominable.
I bet he does sas-squats.
Wouldn’t an acid trip have been easier?
I know you care about me, but he makes me a better person
All he said was ‘Goodbye’, and then mumbled something about ‘The  Ascent Of Man’.
He just wished you'd asked before taking a picture
He said he’s looking for the illusive human.
I don't understand why men refuse to ask for directions.
I told you not to mention Bigfoot.  --Now he's going to pout the rest of the way up!
« He only needs 5,000 steps to reach his goal. »
He says he needs a wall to keep riffraff off the summit.
He’s upset, Charles. I would be too if you called me abominable.
He says he knows where the best wi-fi spot is.
We can never tell your Uncle he was right, we'll never hear the end of it.
Do you think he'd take our picture?
I want a divorce and yes, there is  someone else.
He said, “get your camera out, you’re not going to believe the view!”
So great that your aversion to asking for directions works across species.
I said I would marry you if the Yeti was walking with the tooth fairy!
I thought it would be bigger.
He says he's the new Chief of Staff
You promised your mother wouldn't come this time!
I told him I was married
The only thing that’s abominable, Jonathan, is your manners.
He's moving to higher ground, citing habitat destruction and climate change.
What did I tell you -- "layers."
We talked, and yeti, yeti, yeti, we're engaged.
Big deal! I’d be much more excited by the existence of a snack bar right now.
I have dedicated my whole life to funding him, but I wasn’t expecting him to invite us back for coffee.
Well yes, if you must know...size does matter.
You really insulted him. Any idiot knows the difference between Sasquatch and The Abominable Snowman.
Why would you say that? I told you he was sensitive!
Guess what, Travis. I think YOU'RE abominable.
He is going ahead to see if we can get a table by the window.
You promised there wouldn’t be anyone else on this trail!
He’s  just a friend.
He says he’s got some timeshare opportunities for us.
Abominable?   I found him rather nice.
You say hirsute and I say hairsuit. What's the big deal?
He said,"Don't overthink it."
He says unless he gets the wall he's not coming down.
He said this trail is closed until Trump caves on the wall.
Our guide is a natural.
He says three's a crowd. I'll see you back at base camp.
I'm sorry Chad, but I need a man that doesn't wear a puffy jacket.
Well, did you really think he would help after you called him abominable?
He's very upset over our inaction on climate change
If it looks like the Donald, walks like the Donald, and smells like the Donald, then it probably is a Sasquatch.
You can't just call him that, Jim.
Did you bring your grainy camera?
How would you like it if I called you abominable?
I'm sorry John, but you know what they say about big feet...
Actually, I found him quite personable.
He said to turn around or he's shutting down The Himalayas and building a wall.
That Duluth underwear DOES look comfortable.
Well, it's not the view I was expecting...
He said he doesn't believe in climate change.
If I found him, I can find the trail.
We met on Sasquatch.com!
"Do you think we can ask about Elvis?"
It's nothing personal Chad. He's just more genuine than you.
He was lost.
Oddly enough, he IS dressed for it.
He said he's not interested in being proven to exist. He thrives on the debate.
I recognized the face but couldn’t remember his name.
He said he left his car in the upper parking lot
Well if you're not going to the top with me, I know someone ELSE who is.
When you say abominable, he hears unlovable.
He says he prefers the path less travelled.
Much friendlier than the French!
I didn't see what?
We can't all be real.
He said it's over, stop texting.
He feels unseen.
He wants to be called the Indomitable Snowman from now on.
What’s his deal? All I asked was if he’d take our picture.
It's just funny you're willing to follow anyone but me.
He said, "Don't eat the yellow snow."
That's all he said? "Humans exist."
I'm sorry you came all this way John, but he loves me, hairy armpits and all.
He said there is nothing to see up here.
He says it's not me, it's him.
Abominable is derogatory Steve!
He’s actually quite amiable.
Sorry, Trent. At this point in my life,
I need someone who is more upwardly mobile.
No", he said, "Not yeti." . .
Another fur-loughed park ranger...
"Well, that 'myth' happens to be our sherpa and he's very sensitive about his feet."
Look at me when I'm talking! Don't you realize how unique I am in your life?
I see your mother is joining us.
Really? This mountain, this light and you want a picture of HIM?
How was I supposed to know? I thought they liked being called abominable!
Make sure there's nothing in the background when you take the picture.
Apparently abominable is a trigger word.
Well I’d walk away too if you kept calling me abominable.
Big butt is more like it.
He said, "Get off my lawn!"
I'm sorry, but I need to be with someone who understands my needs.
Can we just ask a local for directions?
When I said bring the Yeti, I meant the thermos...
Is it just me or does our Sherpa have really big feet?
You didn't have to be so rude, he was just asking to borrow your cell phone.
Okay, now that he took off his clothes I can see why you'd think our guide is a Yeti.
He asked me if I had a sister.
I told you my ex was a wild one.
He just ate our sherpa.
Honestly, the only abominable thing was his breath
Of all things, you had to ask about his small hands?
We're in luck! He said he'll be right back with some toothpaste.
I know how you hate to ask for directions. So I asked. And he said “follow me”.
He said three's a crowd
I don't think he's going to be happy when he gets to the top and sees that we pooped in his cave.
His accent is pretty hard to understand, but I've enjoyed the tour so far.
I wouldn't say 'abominable.' I'd say 'rough-hewn.'
Jeez, sometimes it's like I'm invisible or something.
Mr. Yeti said that if we want a selfie at the summit with him AND the snow leopard, we are going to have to upgrade to the Platinum Package...


Leslie Hardin
Summit, New Jersey
He was on the short list to replace Pruitt at EPA, but the President decided he wasn’t abominable enough.
He came out of hiding to run for 2020, says 'he definitely has a shot in this political environment'.
Now can we go home
He just asked me what time it was.
He says it's a pretty hairy climb from here on out...
.....wonder if he knows the Summit Meeting was cancelled"
He's less abominable than I had anticipated.
Now's a good time to start our descent.
His New Years resolution is 20,000 steps a day.
No one ever mentions the abominable snowballs.
Frankly, Josh, I'm fine with you skipping the testosterone therapy.
He says the media spin has gotten out of control 
and that he's really only an 'untidy' snowman.
He asked me for directions
He wants us to wait , he's dropped his sunglasses.
Are you sure there's nothing odd about our tour guide?
He's a bit brusque.  But certainly not abominable.
I thought it was just going to be the two of us this time.
He's putting up a wall and closing the border.
He'll be back after he meets his 10,000-step goal.
He wanted to sell us a timeshare."
Extremely rare, I'd say.  He's never heard of Donald Trump.
He said to forget evolution, he was forging ahead without us.
You forgot to charge the phone?!”
He wanted to know where I got my hiking boots.
Actually,his manners were impeccable.
It's not you, it's the cargo pants.
It's okay. He said the mountain is "clothing optional."
Where'd you find this guide?  Not much of a talker... but he sure seems to know his stuff.
You left your phone at base camp?!
You didn't think 'abominable' was offensive?!
Should I ask if he'll take our picture?
No, YOU’RE abominable!
He says that we are a figment of his imagination.
Why don't you ever wanna ask for directions?
It’s true what they say: big feet, big...
I asked if he’d summited and he said not Yeti.
I thought he'd be taller.
Try “adorable” snowman next time
He said he'll lead us to the summit as long as we don't tell the National Enquirer.
Because he’s mysterious and doesn’t have roommates.
He made a pass at me and you just stood there.
For once your hesitancy of asking locals for directions might actually be justified.
He said he knows the area
No, I didn't sleep with him.  I just used him as a blanket.
At least he puts the toilet seat down!
He said to turn back; the conditions up there are abominable.
All I could make out was "Get off my lawn!".
Look, I know he may not be a conventional tour-guide, but hey, he takes Amex.
He doesn't say much, but he's the best Sherpa we ever had.
Yeti or not there he goes.
He asked me if I had any conditioner.
Call me crazy, but sometimes you act like I don't exist.
I told you we were overdressed.
The Brooklyn beard craze is spreading.
Asking him to 'play through' was a great idea.
He stimulates my heart and mind in ways you'd never understand. So,goodbye,Stanley.
Oh Great.  Now I'm a Bigfoot believer.
Stand back. I'm here to interview him for the White House chief of staff position... everyone else on the planet has refused.
The bastard just farted and kept walking.
Let him play through, he's a regular.
He says we're mythical.
Yeti, schmeti, you were supposed to bring the damn camera.
He looks like he knows where he's going. Let's follow him.
Apologize!
Actually, he's really pretty "ominable" once you get him talking.
There goes another furloughed park ranger.
He asked us to turn down the heat.
Well, I can definitely verify the Yeti is a HE.
Because he gets me! In ways you will never understand! And stop calling him "Bigfoot".
More like adorable snowman.
Well, at least he’d never leave his underwear on the bathroom floor!
It’s not you, it’s me. And him.
As far as I'm concerned he's ancient history
Just had to say the A-word, didn't you?
See, I told you we shoulda packed the camera!
Huh, I thought he’d have bigger feet.
Yeti or not, here we come!
Babe, trust me, it looks like he’s been here before.
And WHY, exactly, didn't you ask him for directions...?
Notice how he leaves no trace?
I've got to go with him.  He's the most understanding...whatever he is ... I've ever met.  I've treated him abominably, Yeti still loves me.
Well that's a letdown. For some reason I thought his feet would be bigger.
He seemed quite pleasant. Not at all abominable.
He's incredibly sensitive. How could you?
He's as lost as we are.
There's something off about our Sherpa.
You know what they say about guys with big feet- well that’s a myth.
He said his life coach recommended nature walks.
He'd like to know why Mad Men was canceled.
From here on, it's clothing optional.
I've found someone else.
Shut up with your animal rights extinction crap. This fur coat isn't getting away.
I didn't find him the least bit abominable.
How was I supposed to know it's insensitive to ask if he's related to Big Foot?
Considering the size of his feet, I wasn't all that impressed.
I said, "Ready to meet the world?" And he said, "Not yeti."
Turns out his name is Melvin.
The track gets a bit hairy from this point
I told you we should have asked for directions sooner.
You're the one that claims to be so evolved
I don't see what's so abominable about complimenting my ponytail Bob.
OK, Big Shot!  You follow him to his cave to see his “etchings!”
What an amateur.  He doesn't even have a backpack, let alone the correct footwear!
Well, he's not abominable to me! Go home, Jack
He said he's sorry, but this is something he has to do alone.
It's not you, it's me. Well, it's me and Bigfoot.
Do you think he'll divulge our existence?
This is not what it looks like, Jack!
I can’t belive he’s wearing real fur, I let him know I just called PETA.
I asked him and he said,"Because it's there."
Nice fella. He says to follow him and he'll have us for dinner.
It was an icy reception at best.
He left his cell phone on the summit.
We need to get our stories straight by the time we get back down"
No, YOU'RE abominable, John.
I told you-they don’t like to be called ‘abominable’ anymore.
He will send us the selfie once he gets better reception.
He won't talk to anyone but CNN.
Well, he probably thinks you're abominable.
No pics. He has strict image and licensing control to avoid brand dilution from commercial over-exposure.
John, sometimes YOU have to ask for directions.
Well how was I supposed to know he's sensitive about the size of his feet?
Don't feel so insecure, he had small hands.
Next time can you hire a Yeti that speaks English?
He's counting steps.
It didn't mean anything to me. It was just a winter fling.
It's the big feet that make his hands look small.
The same thing any of us are seeking, I suppose.  Just wanting to be seen, really seen, by someone.
Look he's not an ideal guide but he really knows the mountains.
I told you not to call him "abominable" to his face.
We went to Cleveland to meet my parents, its only fair that we go to meet his.
It’s just “Snowman”. How would you like it if I always referred to you as Abominable Ralph?
He asked us to pay for a wall.
You clearly offended him by calling him Bigfoot. I believe ‘Yeti’ is the appropriate term.
It was wonderful, but he snores.
He said to get off his yard.
Hands are smaller then you’d think.
"What's 'abominable' is your sensitivity."
I think I know why our guide was so cheap.
Well, I’d be offended too if a stranger called me ‘abominable’.
Relax. At this altitude hallucinations aren't that unusual.
No, you are the one who spends too much time on their phone instead of watching what is going on around them.
I can’t believe it!  A “no photo” policy?!?!
He didn't have a phone charger either
The Air BnB said "quiet and off the grid."
Well, that explains the dimensions of what we found in the out house!
When I asked if you brought your Yeti, I meant your insulated mug...
No really, he’s just a friend!
For the record, I requested a trip to the Serengeti.
I would say that greeting a Yeti as Bigfoot qualifies us as ugly Americans.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're insufferable!
He'll guide us, but he only takes Bitcoin.
You are both behaving abominably.
Wow! I guess the Paleo diet really works.
Did you have to mention the size of his feet?!
He said the final ascent is his ‘me  time’.
I think he knows the way
Sorry.  You know what they say about big feet.
Honey, we were just talking.
Ignore him, he's trying to get his 10,000 steps before dinner
We just weren’t right for each other. He felt the need to Sasquatch-splain everything to me.
All it said was 'Yeti or not, here I come' "
Just gave me the cold shoulder.
Of course he's upset, Kevin. "Hey Yeti, take a selfie with my Betty?" Seriously?!
We agreed to remain friends.
I thought your New Year's resolution was to start making new friends.
Simmer down, Harry. We're just friends.
I still cannot believe you found this Sherpa on Yelp - he's amazing!!
I thought the hair was supposed to be thinner up here.
He says he knows a shortcut. What do you think?
I swear, Bill, he's just a friend I happen to bump into occasionally.
He says he knows the way to a bathroom.
He says he's going to run against Trump in 2020.
I told him no pants, no cocoa.
I think we're overdressed.
He said, and I quote, 'You can't get theah from heah'.
Apparently we misgendered the Abominable Snow Man
Yes, there is a restaurant on the summit but he says the service is  abominable.
He says we should have turned right at the ravine. Now aren’t you glad we stopped for directions?
Who would have known that he's in the Witness Protection Program?
Unlike you, he hasn't reached his peak.
I told him “no thanks, I have Google Maps.”
I swear, Peter, nothing happened.
He said our use of adjectives is abominable
Oddly, he doesn't leave footprints.
Well, it's true what they say about big feet.
He says he doesn't have any idea of where the trail is, but rather smugly pointed out that he isn't lost.
Confirmed...Starbucks ahead one mile!
Yes, I'm leaving you.  He has more than a big foot.
He finished with, “Say you never saw me.”
Apparently they run the upper section as a nudist colony.
He said "Its to cold out here and he will wait for us in the car".
Great, Todd.  Now even the Yeti is leaving!
Hey hey! Eyes over here!
Well, his English was good enough to know what 'needs a bath' means.
Why didn't you tell me this hike was clothing optional?
He's going back for his Non-disclosure Agreement.
Our guide is kind of built for this, don't you think?
Let's follow him. I think he knows where the president's tax returns are.
Well, I think your feelings would be hurt, too, if someone called you abominable.
You just couldn't be the bigger man.
Funny they named him big foot, when that's not the big appendage that jumped out at me.
He says we're welcome at the top, just not yeti.
Sorry, I prefer the strong, silent, abominable type.
There's a thin line between lovable and abominable.
He said he dropped the "Abominable" years ago.
A better plan?? How about down?
Honestly, I thought I was sleeping with you.
Because of someone he called the "Orange-haired Abominable Showman," he decided to disappear again until at least 2020.
He prefers abominable snow person Bob!
No, Ted-- you're fine. This is about me.
He says we're lost.  Loch Ness isn't anywhere around here.
There's always somebody who shows off with no proper equipment or clothes.
Well, he calls you the Abominable Keith!
Goodbye, John, no more washing & ironing shirts for me.
I don't care if there are 10 Big Feet behind me!
I just feel like it's weird that he's technically naked.
He said no to the selfie but otherwise seemed nice.
He was asking for directions.
No, he goes by ‘Barefoot’
Are you checking her out?!
He says the guru is just a myth.
Of course he's upset. You treated him abominably.
Who knew!... he’s not abominable at all.
The government shutdown is awful for sure ... but this volunteer tour guide is fantastic.
Thankfully, he said he's a vegan now
That reminds me, I forgot to pack my razor.
Sure. I turn around and you shout, Gotcha! Very funny.
Wow. 'Abominable?' Really, Greg?
There's a lot more to him than those big feet!
Who knew he was sensitive about his body hair?
I guess he's not missing anymore.
He's going back for his parka.
He says he’s considering running in 2020 because he can’t be any worse than the incumbent.
Well if you won't ask him for directions than I will!
The one time we forgot the camera!
I said good morning and how are you doing and all he said was 
" I go up, I come down, Yeti Yeti Yeti"
Should I say something?
He says it's Jeti with a "J"!
He said the 'mile high club' is a myth.
‘Not entirely unlike Sisyphus,’ were his words to me in passing.
He's leaving - said he's on a quest for intelligent life forms
It IS true what they say about big feet...
He says the best ascent is up the north ridge, but then again, he doesn't exist!
Hi, I'm Maggie - so what inspired you to try out high-altitude speed dating?
He said “Millennials are abominable.”
Honestly, I thought his footprints would be bigger.
Follow him if you want, but I don't think he really knows where the bathroom is.
It's not what it looks like...
Relax, he didn't even get to first base camp.
Looks like this next stretch is going to get pretty hairy.
I wasn't mocking him; I thought "Abominable" was his first name.
Should we have asked for a selfie?
His wife made him stop and ask directions.”
Don't worry, no one will believe he reached the summit first.
so apparently it's just a myth about foot size for men
He says another 2000 feet and then it's all down hill.
Was that necessary? Did you have to call him abominable?
For only a small extra fee, the guides will wear the costume for 
our selfies at the top.
Brad, you can't just ask him why he's abominable.
I thought you said we'd have the summit to ourselves.
I told you we were going the right way.
Abominable he can live with," he says,"but Bigfoot hurts his feelings.
For the last damned time, I didn't eat your trail mix.
Is it me or is the guide a bit rude?
He asked me if he was close to the top
Wow! This nature walk really lets you get in touch with the locals!
I think he said, "It's 5 o'clock somewhere."
I think he just made an anti-Homo sapien remark.
Just because he is abominable, doesn't mean he's a bad leader.
Go back to the last glacier and take a RIGHT, just like I said the first time.
That's it--I'm asking for directions!
He's much more handsome than his photos.
Let's cancel next week's trip to Loch Ness.
I can't believe you used the a-word.
I'm leaving you for someone far more abominable.
He wanted to know if 2020 was over.
He asked if we knew any single and abominable snow women.
He said he is not from around here.
He said we should try the Paleodiet
He said, "All they call me is Big Foot, but they should see my other parts!!"
Okay, first off.... He doesn’t appreciate the label “abominable.”
Why don't men ask for directions when they're lost?
I’m sorry to leave you Mark, but he’s more of a social climber.
Just because I haven't shaved my legs in a while doesn't give you the right to draw a comparison.
The border's just ahead, but he says there's a very big wall.
He invited me up for a drink.
His friends don't think we exist, so he's getting a lump of charcoal to draw us.
He said we should have turned left at the crevasse to get to Starbucks.
Lets just follow that guy, he seems to know where he is going
He's my support Yeti.
See, I told you this hike would be legendary.
Who is he to be lecturing us about footprints?
I had to find out if it was true what they say about big feet.
He has a summer place at Loch Ness.
People say we're  self-absorbed. Do you think we're self-absorbed?
Nope. I didn't see anything either.
I told you he wasn't real!  Do you see any footprints??
Don't worry, he's only a myth
He wants us off his mountain. We're not white enough.
You had to put your big foot in your mouth!
I've told you Greg, it's not the size of your feet that's the issue.
Well, he looked like he knew the way out of the parking lot.
Don't bother asking -- he already has home, auto, and life.
He likes what I do with my hair.
Go ahead, you tell him we are going the wrong way.
I've decided I need to try something different in life--don't take it personally.
Maybe we've been reading that evolution diagram backwards.
Actually, he respects me.
Just ask him for directions.
I asked if we found the abominable snowman. He said, “Not Yeti.”
I just said “You know what they say about big feet” and he stormed off.
He said he'll have another showing in two weeks.
Sorry, but I have to follow my inner yeti.
Asking him about his origins was very discriminating. YOU are a monster.
That's all right -- he doesn't believe in you, either."  --Stephen West, Laurel, Marylan
No hello! Not a smile!  Not even a nod! No wonder his ilk went extinct!
He said no pictures, but I got an autograph.
He never really believed in me.
It's amazing what you can do with a comb-over!
I told you that we were overdressed!"
He insisted his name was Yuri, not Yeti.
Think he'd be offended if I asked him to take our photo?
He says he's not coming down until they bring back the McRib.
Ignore him.  He doesn't like to be noticed.
He keeps muttering "I am not fake news.  I am not fake news"
Why don't YOU tell him that he's abominable?
He says there's nothing to see here
Didn’t that guy pass us eons ago?
The oxygen is too thin up here — and besides, he just ate Jim.
Did you see his six pack. Abdominal indeed!
I told you it's better to follow the locals
I figured he'd take "abominable" as a compliment.
Sorry Eric, even he doesn’t want Mattis’ job
Actually, his name is Bigdick — he’s Bigfoot’s more popular brother.
It’s Abominable SnowPerson!
Wish you had one that big!
I told him to stay hidden until Trump was gone.
He’s going ahead to prepare the appetizers
No more abominable than the rest of you.
Until this moment, I thought you were pretty well endowed!
It’s great, you still spot some of the old locals around here, it’s the only bit of Everest that we haven’t totally gentrified
Oh just give it up already. You’ll never convince him down is superior to fur.
Dad, you promised you wouldn't make a scene!
Let’s ask him for directions; he seems to be a local.
Look, he doesn't want to be in the selfie.
Actually, no.  I found him to be quite pleasant.
I thought he said Eddie, not yeti.
Keep quiet, the body language says he's not going to be responsible for his actions if we keep asking, are we their yeti ?
Good news. We found him.
Bad news. He's not into us.
We're out of luck -- he didn't bring his selfie stick either.
Fictional or not, he’s a heckuva trail guide.
He's taking us to Elvis and the Easter Bunny.
I'm sorry, Steve, but I've found someone else.
That's Mister Everest. He's the owner.
Because he's not a wuss.
Please don't ruin this by proposing at the summit.
I'm sorry to say, but foot size has nothing to do with it.
Yes, I am leaving you.
I told you a million times Steve, that was decades before we met. It's long over, leave him alone
Don't be jealous--I don't see him often.
Can you believe it? He said we’re an illusion because we’re not leaving tracks.
Well, I'd bet your feelings would be hurt if I called you abominable.
Okay Wendell, Billy is not your son. I suppose it was only a matter of time before you guessed the truth anyway.
Nice, Dan! I told you not to say anything. He has a "condition".
I'm HIS service animal. He calls me "Not Yeti."
What is wrong with you?  He says there's a Starbucks up there.  Why don't you believe anyone about anything?
You promised we wouldn’t see any other tourists.
I have a funny feeling about our trail guide, yet - I can't put my finger on why
You first...
He's just misunderstood. There were more abominable people at base camp.
You just had to insist we leave our smartphone-cameras behind on this climb, didn't you Nature Boy?
Look,they don't leave footprints after all.
He says Bigfoot's a myth.
Evolution? We can’t even keep up with him.
He obviously hasn't seen the Patagonia catalogue.
He was happy to hear that the climate is warming, since he is losing some of his hair.
He asked me if I know of a good place for electrolysis.
He’s going to get his family for a group selfie
Climate change is driving them to higher elevations.
You don't even know him - your intolerance is what's abominable.
I swear it's over. He's an animal.
He just called me an abominable human!
'He says he's gonna build a wall.'
Tinder is really getting weird.
This isn't what it looks like...
Really, mister sensitive, 'abominable?'
Is that what we were or what we will be?
Did you have to use the A-word?
He says that the only thing that’s abominable these days is Trump.
He said the view's not worth it.
Did you have to call him Abominable?
Sasquatch? No, it’s only Trump in costume hiding from Nancy Pelosi.
He’ll be right back, he left his shades in the car.
He says the conditions ahead are just abominable
He said he was flattered, but worried about the optics of another white male hosting the Oscars.
Sasquatch? Really? I can't believe you think all ape-like creatures look the same.
I told you he wouldn't care about your bucket list.
You’re the one with no social skills!
Yer damn straight I married 'im, and he wants you to stop followin' us."
I swear, I've never seen him before in my life.
Looks like your claim about making it to the top isn’t the only urban legend around here.
He asked me for my phone number
If I have to say size doesn't matter one more time . . .
I told you not to book an unlicensed Sherpa.
He asked for a MAGA hat: he's a big fan of isolationism.
He said the Starbucks is up ahead.
Believe it Seth, you’re finally free to date that mermaid in 11b
You shouldn't have said that about his feet.
I'm tired of your constant complaining, Richard.  Either pick up the pace or we'll go on without you.
He's going back into hiding since there are more than enough people being abominable without him.
Hunting Big Foot would be a lot easier if we weren't blind.
Yeti, Schmeti... He said his name is Paul.
George, I'd like to start seeing other people.
I already asked. He said it’s faux fur.
I'm leaving you because he validates my feelings.
Thru-hikers are so intense.
No, the most amazing part was finding myself.
I tried to say "Happy New Year", but my yettish isn't very good.
Let him go first.  He was born here.
I’m really not sure which of you is worse at asking for directions.
I’m seeing somebody else.
He says the coffee at the top is terrible. Let's turn back.
Allen, I meant “abominable” in the best way possible!
I told you, Michael. He’s just an old friend.
He said we can check in to his Airbnb any time now.
He thought we were from Publisher’s Clearing House
I told you he'd be offended if you asked if he was 'for real.'
That's nice of you to say, but if my husband was truly a legend, I wouldn't be the one asking you for directions.
He might be abominable but that is no excuse to be rude!
Of course he ignored us, he's an anti-social climber.
I don't know. He just gave me the cold shoulder
No, I thought that you brought the phone.
He said we have to contact his Agent for a picture.
No, he's on his way to Washington, D.C. to protest. President Trump just did away with the endangered species act.
God, I hate how your mom follows us everywhere!
He said there's nothing worth seeing up there.
Sorry, that threw me for a minute. That was my ex.
He's nothing but a show-off. Big foot, bigger ego.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
You want to know what's really abominable?  Your readiness to judge based on appearance.
I can't believe you said that.  Now tell him you're sorry!
I've met someone else.
Uncle Bill loves to scare the crap out of mountain climbers.
I told him fur is murder and he just ignored me.
He doesn't believe there's an abominable president.
Yeah....we met on tinder.
Steve, we should have asked him for directions!  HE looks like he knows where he's going...
Would you believe, he asked me to go up to his place.
Don't worry. He's just a manifestation of your oxygen deprivation.
I bet you used the word 'abominable'"
Puffy jackets are out.  The Performance Fleece Onesie is the new must have.
Who knew he'd be so sensitive about his body hair?!
Hello? Would you mind taking a photo of us?
I can't help but feel like I'm missing something big...
Tesla stock down again? I bet next you’ll tell me Sasquatch is standing right behind me!
We need to head back now! The hallucinations are getting worse.
He's a myth, you're not. Suck it up and stop whining!
Bill, I've met someone new.
He just wanted to make sure we weren't planning on staying and transforming the neighborhood into a hipster's paradise.
Maybe next time bring the camera instead of that damn hiking stick.
I hope you know that without a selfie no one will believe us!
It's not what you think...
I knew the summit was at 8 thousand feet, but nobody told me they'd be BIG feet
He'll guide us to the top, but we can't take pictures.
Doesn't know, says he's from out-of-town.
Let's just say, it's not just his foot that's big.
He says we should have taken that left back at the Denny's.
Quick, take a picture ... he didn't leave any foot prints!
Abominable? Really, Jim? Really
He isn't even TRYING to hide from us!  I'm a little insulted.
Please do hurry, James, he says the Starbucks closes in ten minutes.
Don't be too hard on yourself George. I've just always been attracted to mysterious men.
Dave, I told you not to talk about politics!
If I ever get on Jeopardy this is definitely the story I’m telling Alex Trebek!
I have to warn you: I'm just out of an abominable relationship.
No,no...that's not him..I'm looking for the Adorable Snowman!
He said he’ll appreciate it we just follow him on Twitter and/or Instagram.
Your yodeling offended him.
What did you say to him this time?
Oh that’s Larry - he’s a bit of a local celebrity.
I asked him if he was cold and he said "not yeti"!
He said he'd take us as far as Yetisburg.
Look, bigfoot- bigass- we all see things differently, Gary. Does it really matter?! We're lost! Don't you get that?! Let's just ask the guy, 'which way to the summit.' He seems like a local. He should know.
Do I really have to be the one to ask him for directions?!
Apparently he finds your puffy jacket abominable.
He’s kind of sensitive about the back hair.
You have some big shoes to fill now, Buster.
He said that we are lost
Who knows? He just wanted directions.
With Amazon Prime, we get free Sherpa.
I don't care that you two were frat brothers Larry, we are NOT staying in his cave!
Would Bigfoot ask to borrow a phone charger?
The moment Jill realizes that “cold weather shrinkage” might be a phenomenon unique to humans.
Himalaya, if you know what I mean.
Well... I do want to be taken higher.
My Fitbit says 1,000 steps to the top. His says 250. Go figure.
Yes, the tour guide is very experienced.
“no, Ken - You’re abominable!”
Does your father always have to take off his clothes when he feels hot?
'You know I've always wanted a REAL mountain man, Stan.'
He said the guru is on the next mountain over.
I promise, I'll never see him again!
Don't drag him into this. I left because YOU are the abominable one!
Wow. That better be faux fur.
His name is Francis. You're the abominable one.
You're nice but he's Bigfoot. I've been looking for him my whole life.
He says there's no Starbucks.
He said, "I'm not the Bigfoot you're looking for," but that may have been just a Yeti mind trick.
He says he doesn’t want to be discovered.
Nature sure does get interesting during these government shutdowns.
Yes, I do feel sometimes like evolution has passed me by.
He said he was going up for an iced coffee and asked me if I wanted anything.
I won't tell if you won't tell.
He said the nearest Starbuck's is two mountains to the left, and down about 4500 feet.
You know the old saying?
It will never be the right place to tell you I found someone else.
He just wanted to know who won the election.
He said he's never hiked here before, Yeti looks so familiar.
No problem! He just wanted directions on how to get to Burning Man
Sure you don't want to meet my Dad?
He says he's king of the hill.
If he really is so abominable, then why did he just compliment your jacket?
The next stretch is a little hairy.
No Doug, I haven't heard what they say about guys with big feet.
Abomanable sex is still sex.
Our Smartphone detox was your idea.
He told me a little higher up there's a WALL to keep us out.
And I say we follow him!
I told him I was seeing someone else.
It'll be hard to follow in his footsteps.
I said to follow “Siri”, not “Yeti”!
Honest, we're just friends.
He's going to show us a shortcut.
He's announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run in 2020.
Quick, give him your business card. You are the manager of a Big and Tall store.
He asked if he was near the top.  I said "Not Yeti."
But he called me, “Sheena of the Mountain;” you only call me a social climber.
And when have you ever wanted to ask for directions?
I hear the next stretch can get pretty hairy.
Clothes optional from this point on.
I can’t believe you dropped the “A” bomb!
He's upset; he thought it was "abdominal."
He's not mad.  He just wants to be seen.
You’re right.  That is who I was making the sweater for.
Don't be so sensitive!  I just said he was a huge guy.
He said our table will be ready in 5 minutes
I don't think so...I heard him muttering that it was a long way to go just for some crappy star wars convention...
Well if you hadn't called him 'The Abominable Slow Man'...
Not a soul. You?
Okay, so he says we took a wrong turn back at base camp.
Sorry to drag you along for nothing ... he looked nothing like his tinder profile photo!
But why do you trust his directions over mine?
You just HAD to say manscaping!
I'm leaving you Harry...for Hairy.
If I knew he was so sensitive about the size of his feet, I would have called him Sasquatch.
See I told you...he said were going the wrong way!
He's not abominable at all. He's been very helpful.
Is it just me or does he look much scarier on Instagram?
Did you see that guy’s calves?
Sorry, but I'm leaving you for someone more grounded and in touch with nature.
HE SAID NEXT HE’S GOING TO FORD EVERY STREAM.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HIS FEELINGS. WHAT DOES "ABOMINABLE" MEAN ANYWAY?
Look, I know you said you’re good with anything, but I feel like I need to ask again. Are you sure you want to go to this orgy?
I swear. Nothing happened!
He hasn’t seen him.
You called him Bigfoot?!
Frankly, sometimes you're kind of abominable too, Greg.
Nice but a bit paranoid. How many people can be looking for him?
If he eats there, how bad can it be?
He asked if you would wait for us here.
He says we can get a signal up here.
He says we can use the trails all we want, but his Himalaya Shutdown is going ahead no matter what.
This is why we need immigration reform.
He'll be right back; he left his iphone in the cave
He said "Abominable is in the eye of the beholder."
I think you insulted him when you said "I don't believe it!"
Sorry, Topher, I need more mystery in a man.
Wow, you really are never going to propose, are you?
He's going back up. He thinks it's become abominable down here.
'He said walking sticks are for pussies.'
Taking that gap year did a lot for his self-confidence.”
I’m sorry but he just fulfills my fantasies more than you.
You're smarter but he's got the edge in experience.
I told you he was sensitive about his body hair, Greg!
Bob, our mountain guide is a beast. There's no way we'll keep up.
Oh yeah?  Well, he's a lot less abominable than your "vacation" idea.
He said his name is Harvey Weinstein.
No, Mr. Insecure, I couldn't see how hung he is.
With the furlough, he's had to pull double shifts to rescue hikers.
It's a Yeti not a Yogi! Is it any wonder he goes out of his way to avoid people?
He said he preferred Saquatch, but if I can't spell it right, go with Bigfoot.
“Size does matter - it’s true what they say about big feet."
Some call him Sasquatch, yeah, but us locals call him hairy naked Bill.
This tourism on Everest is getting out of control.
I didn't mean to hurt you, Larry. There's just something so indescribably sexy about a no-maintenance guy--no clothes, no chitchat, no toilet paper--nothing.
We leave a bigger footprint than he does!
Next time you hire a guide get a background search, this guy's abominable!”
Funny how myths develop.  Compared to you today, he wasn’t so abominable after all.
I said call him Snowman - he hates 'Abominable.'
And yeti seemed so nice.
That's the last time I'll swipe right on a profile without a picture.
Said he was out for some “me time” then just kept right on walking.
Size matters.
He was heading down for groceries, but forgot his cell phone.
Ugh. Are you happy NOW that we deleted Facebook? Everyone would be so jealous right now.
I haven't seen any footprints either.
Can't be him. Feet are way too small.
Big foot my ass!! You always change the subject when you’re caught!
Relax, George. I just told him threesomes are not our cup of tea
You've got some pretty big shoes to fill.
I think he's Italian.  I asked to get a selfie with him, and he kept saying "not yeti....not yeti"
You just had to comment on his looks, didn't you?
He said it hurts his feelings when we call him Abominable.
Well, you know what they say about men with big feet...
He says it's pronounced yeh--TEE.
I just told him to take a hike
Don't be so judgy. He looks mostly harmless and he is going our way.
I spoke to the local and it seems we’ve been going the wrong way.
People laugh, but you don't see him freezing out here.
Actually, he seems indomitable.
Staying warm must have been more important to him than evolution.
Don't, he'll just use it for drugs.
Actually, he was only mildly unpleasant.
He says to please tell the world that they may be wide, but really they're just a size 9 1/2.
He says he's not coming down until people get over the whole 'abominable' thing.
He’s not just abominable, he’s rude!
Good job, guide!  He said we should be on the mountain over there!
Clearly man is not on the ascent.
I cant't believe you called him the "Y" word!
Who invited your mother?
He said there's a two hour wait.
He said ' No pictures'.
He recommends the fondue from the chalet on the left.
He prefers Sasquatch. Says the mean kids stuck him with Big Foot.
I wanted to be first, so we might as well go back.
I told him to go get lost if he wants to preserve his reputation
And of course now I realize we left the camera back in the tent!
I envy his lack of gear.
These new sunglasses really make a big difference. I'm seeing details I never noticed before.
She’s a lot taller than I expected
Way to go! You hurt his feelings.
He's not leaving any footprints!
You go first, dear.
You wait here Jeremy, he wants to show me the view
He says not Yeti.
Yeah, we can go on up, but I had to give him my Netflix passcode.
He said to leave behind only a small carbon footprint.
Really, he means nothing to me.
I swear I’ve never seen him before!
Abominable, shmabominable, at least he asks for directions.
We’re friends on Instagram
What do you want from me.....he was the only guide they had left!
Honey, I really enjoyed the Pilates, the tapas dipped in flecks of gold, and the W.B. Yeats poetry, but I want someone more primitive.
I told you the lack of oxygen does wonders for the imagination.
Apparently, they're very serious about casual Fridays.
He says he's got wi-fi
It's Esteem Lacking Snow Person now.
This guide was highly rated on Yelp!
Shhhh, shhhhh, there goes my ex.
He’s just trying to find himself.
No Harvey, he's just an old college friend!
I'll admit Gary's a little grumpy in the mornings, but i wouldn't call him abominable...
He wanted to know if i've seen his polar bear
That's my guide.  Thank god for Google Translate.
He said the "23andMe" thing is baloney.
I know you warned me but he's still my Dad!
No, I don't think he saw us.
He's a great guide, just no photo ops.
Should we ask him to take our picture?
The all-knowing Guru on top of the mountain? He said he ate him.
Could you hold up for a bit and give us some space?
I'm sick and tired of living your fantasies
Let’s see if he will take our photo.
Actually he was quite pleasant . . . amiable, certainly not abominable.
Yeah. He won’t do any free sightings. He’s going to wait out the shutdown.
You said you wanted to meet my parents, right?
I told you before, size doesn’t matter!
He says he needs to get home in time for Dancing with the Stars.
He says it's at least another mile and honestly I'm like, how amazing is it ACTUALLY gonna be?
He hit on me, some line about big feet.
I'm keeping my name professionally but, yeah, officially it's Karen Bragin-Yeti.
Maybe you shouldn't have called him "abominable" to his face.
The Abominable Snowman isn't coming down with us. He's feels the abominable creature we've elected is already one too many.
How could you? You know he's sensitive to the use of the "A" word!
I told you we should have brought our camera. He only wanted $5 for a selfie with him.
He's half the man and twice the beast that you are.
You go. I want to be found.
Yes, and it was the best I ever had !
How rude of you! He only asked for directions.
He said there's a Starbucks just over the next ridge.
His unicorn got away.  He's wondering if you've seen it.
He said we are on the wrong path to enlightenment.
He says the view is so-so.
he said, nothing to see up there...
He said there’s nothing interesting to see up there.
What did he mean when he said we'll be late for dinner?
Nothing three or four episodes of "Queer eye" wouldn't take care of...
He suggested we try the ascent tomorrow; conditions today are abominable.
He told me he's lost
This is where we part ways.
You just had to tell him that he isn’t wearing pants,
I know he's experienced, but what are his references?
He said there's nothing of note up there, so we might as well give up on finding anything interesting. This whole trip was a waste of time!
YOU wanted to hire a GUIDE, so we are going to follow HIM!
Yeah, I saw it!--Must be the latest from Patagonia.
I have a feeling we ain't seen nothing yeti.
I'll never let you set me up on a blind date again!
See? I told you he’d lap us again.
He just said we should be careful, you never know what creatures are walking around up here.
I told you he was easily offended.
He keeps saying it's just a little bit farther, just over that hill, and he'll show us something really cool!
It will be a more pleasant climb if you stay down wind from him
Don’t worry Jim, he has a 5-star Airbnb experience rating
He's part of the nudist colony just off the trail.
Are you sure he's a local?
He doesn't look as big in person.
Ohh...hello dear, it isnt how it looks
He's still mad about getting no credit from Hillary on Everest.
He claims to have been the president.
He's always in a mood during tourist season.
Hey, he knows a short cut.
He may look like a veteran hiker, but he’s just a Wookie.
The one time you ask for directions...and it's from a Yeti.
Post-impeachment, he just wants to be left alone.
You might as well turn back. There's really nothing to see up there.
He won't let us pass due to the shutdown
He exposed himself and all you could do was take a photo!?
I’m leaving you. He really knows how to make me peak.
All he said was, 'I want to be alone'.
Was that the Dos Equis guy?
He says it’s too damn hot and come back after we stop global warming.
All I did was to ask him if he thought global warming was fake news.
Let him lead he knows the neighborhood
He said “Follow me if you want to see something really interesting”.
But he swears he knows this trail like the back of his foot.
This is where Biggie and I leave you.
I guess it’s true what they say - Bigfoot, big...
He says his name is "Tom", he's currently unattached, and his brothers are all tall too - oh, and he hates having his picture taken...
He said there are no facilities past this point
And yet i still don't believe
Of course he resents being called Abominable."
He says he has a higher calling....
He’s running for President.
I'm telling you--Cross Fit.
It is your behavior that I find abominable!
He said, "Frosty's a snowman. I'm a yeti."
We've just been ignored by a Yeti, Josh.  Makes me feel, well, abominable, actually.
The Contiki website said he’s an abominable tour guide, but so far I’d say he’s been great!
Wouldn't you know, the selfie was all blurry.
It’s his mountain. I’m not going to drop in without a gift.
We talked, but even his words were blurry and ambiguous.
He said cell reception was better near the top.
"I know I recognize him from somewhere, but I just can't put my finger on it.
He says he’s building a wall.
Please tell me it's Halloween and that's your very large friend wearing a costume.
Yeah, well, I can't help his language skills, but he's still the guide.
You've really offended him Bill. You just don't call a Yeti Bigfoot
These days I never know what to believe
No John, he doesn't have a big dick
Come on Todd, I may be blind but my nose works.
Okay, I have been seeing someone else."
See, I told you fur was in again.
It's been downhill with us for so long, I just need a change.
"He prefers Melvin to Sasquatch. But he'll answer to Bigfoot."
He says he wants to clean up a little first.
I think we’ve discovered who’s really abominable here—and I’m pressing on with the yeti.
I actually think his feet are the perfect size for his body.
I'm not afraid but... I'll race you to the bottom...
I don't know what's worse--me running out of water or you running out of photo storage space on your iPhone.
Who knew we’d run in to the next GOP Presidential candidate up here!
I TOLD YOU he wouldn't want to take a selfie!
You hired him as our guide so who's the neanderthal really?
Yeah, well the stench is real too. I'm heading back.
He said, "46 and half, triple E."
Suddenly me not having a razor for a week doesn't seem so bad, huh?
He is less abominable where it counts ... good bye and good luck.
He asked for my number then remembered he left his phone in his cave.
He Said, "No Habla Ingles!"
Wow. I guess it's really true what they say about a man who has a big  foot".
He wanted to know what 'abominable' means.
I think he said we're near the top, but his accent is abominable.
You don’t always get to choose your mentor in life, Jason.
He may know the mountain but that doesn't mean we should follow him
Yes, Brad! I’m going with the yeti.
His daughter lost a mitten yesterday, he's just out checking everywhere.
Yeti, schmeti, I say let’s follow him!
So sorry John. I'm in love with him. We're going to meet his mom.
He said, "Google Earth can just leave me the hell alone."
Oh stop. You just have footprint envy.
I bet that guy knows something we don't.
He said he's a local but I'd feel more comfortable looking it up on Waze.
Every day about this time. He has quite a commute.
He's actually sort of likable.
He would come down more often but people keep talking about his feet.
He says he has to get back to the White House.
Looks easier without a backpack.
I know it’s Trump, it said it was the greatest abdominal snowman.
He says the mountain is calling, but so is nature.
He asked if Trump was still alive.
No!  We cannot go to his place for “drinks.”
It's over. I'm leaving you to start a new life with Jeffrey!
He packed NONE of his waste out of base camp.  Talk about abominable!
You see, I told you my dad could keep up with us.
He’s harmless; he just wants trail mix.”
These Virtual Reality sunglasses are really fantastic!
He's one of the locals.
He said we're still about 1,000 big feet away from the peak
I kinda like my men hairy...
It gets pretty hairy from here.
I told you not to call him abominable!
He says the bathrooms are closed due to the Trump shut down .
Is he gone? Phew...we used to date. It did NOT end well.
He’s invited us to dinner.
...he said he’s pissed off...his 23andMe came back and he’s related to Elizabeth Warren...
He just asked to use my phone for a selfie as he’s not sure he really exists.
I told him: "Long-term commitment or take a hike!"
It’s over, I swear! I ‘m pretty sure he’ll just walk away and I’ll never see him again.
Ugh, I told you there'd be tourists.
The only thing abominable here is your lack of sensitivity.
All the money we spent on gear and we still can't keep up with him.
No - It's his cousin The Respectable Yeti
He's upset that no-one ever mentions his calves.
He's just not that into you.
So... There is a Mar-a-Largo Himalaya.
For crying out loud, George. It's Yeti, not Abominable Snowman! You're being terribly insensitive.
I'm done Mark — I get that your Dad is a nature person, but he needs to put some clothes on.
He looks less abominable in person.
You'll never guess who I ran into!
Because when you lead you get distracted and--look at me--and something inevitably gets missed.
Sasquatch has a point Bob, Trump clearly personifies the fatal flaws in postmodern social constructivist thinking..!
He thinks you are abominable.
Abominable"? Really? You can be so insensitive sometimes
We've got to stop meeting like this.  I think he's suspicious.
He had a thick accent but I think he said that we are ducked.
He wants a mate but I told him I couldn't cook.
He wanted to be a guide on Mt. Rainier, but couldn't get a visa.
It was YOUR idea to build a snowman. All I did was splice some genes to make it happen.
He’s my friend so get over it.
He's just got a bad rep. He's actually quite a conversationalist.
He forgot the keys.
He'll be back when he meets his daily step goal.
where did you get this guide
He’s cooler than you’d expect.
He says we misunderstood.  The yogi is on the other mountain.
He was the last Sherpa available but so far he's been great.
He said no selfie's, but you just couldn't let it go!
Why do you lash out at every guy with bigger feet?
But he said it’s quicker than going through the valley.
He's not afraid of  us personally, but he thinks it's an I.R.S. audit.
He said he just wanted to know if it was 2020 yet.
He doesn't want to be called fake news anymore.
He’s really serious about the Paleo diet; I see him hiking this hill everyday.
What's abominable is your attitude!!
Your wife looks pissed!
He said, 'Baby it's cold outside...'
Anywhere he wants to.
He wants to know if Robert Mueller has been asking for him.
You know, if we weren't blind maybe we could find big foot
He said we can come up but not yeti.
I'm sorry, Jason, but I have to follow my heart.
It was just a coincidence!  I am not obsessed with him!
Hi - I just met the nicest guy. Local fella. Says he owns a restaurant up top. Invited us to stop by.
He says he used to be President of the United States but was found to be abominable.
He seemed super relatable until he made me sign an N.D.A.
Sorry Jim but if I have to live with an abominable man, size matters!
What guy?
He said he was doing research on, “The Ascent of Man.”
Not to worry, he was just asking for directions.
I'm sorry but my foot fetish is bigger than both of us.
He says his real name is "Abdominal"
No footprints! So he’s not real, and we’re not, either!
Well, how would you feel if someone called you 'Abominable'?
Good thing we made reservations.  He said it's always
crowded at peak times.
He was surprisingly articulate.
So now what?
He said he didn't have a watch.
He said, 'Tell Trump he better start worrying about global warming or he'll quickly learn who's actually abominable.'
He said he's sorry, he loves you, but it's over.  You can keep the stick.
He said he’s tired of waiting for the Uber.
Wait a half hour before using the bathroom after him.
I TOLD you, NO politics.
I feel like we're missing something.
We may have named him Yeti, but he prefers Bob.
It's over, Brad. Squatch is giving us a minute to say farewell.
I would never have believed it. A harrier butt than yours does exist.
Just because it looks like he might make it all the way to the top, doesn't mean we have to follow him Dan.
He thinks we should start seeing other people
The guide reviews in Trip Advisor said that Yeti is not much of a talker but he knows his way around the mountain.
He said we are welcome to stay but the toilets are overflowing because of the shutdown.
I'm sorry, Larry, but he's offering me a home with a view.
Ah-Yeah, I think he knows the mountain a little better than that sherpa you wanted to hire.
All he asked is that I spell his name correctly. So, yeah, it was worth it.
Stop him! Maybe he can take a picture of us!
Can you take a picture of me with the mountains? Just make sure the yeti doesn't show up in the background and ruin the shot.
You’re the one who’s abominable.
Once he finds himself the mystery's over.
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned shrinkage.
Well I will, if you are too embarrassed to ask for directions Tom
Well, I don’t think he’s the least bit abominable.
I gave him our outfitter's card.
That's your problem, Roger, you're always so jealous if I look at another guy.
Don't worry,it was consensual.
He said the LGBTQ community just doesn't​ get "other".
I've had it with Colorado men. I'm going to try this for a while.
I told him to go home to his wife and cubs and quit hitting on female tourists.
Well, he did say 'no selfies'.
You and your labels...you just insulted him!
I’m his agent so if you want to meet him talk to me
He's much warmer than you Stan.
This trail is getting way too trendy.
He said it’s Yanni. Now pay up.
Just because you found me with a naked yeti doesn’t mean I’m having an affair.
I trust him. He's white.
Relax Andy.  If he was going to eat us why would he offer to let us use his phone to call search and rescue?
George, trust me, that is NOT a Sherpa.
I think I ate too much of the cookie.
We dated briefly... he wasn’t my type.
It's just teen angst, dear. He won't always be this reclusive.
You just never know when you'll spot a celebrity!
My ex.
Not so abominable in the sack!
Yes honey-size matters...he's not just big foot!
He said 13EEE.
Really? You know hoax is a trigger for him!
Are you even listening to me?!
I don’t care who she is!!! It’s demeaning how you look at other women.
You count to 20 while WE go and hide.
Next year we're doing Christmas at *my* parents' house.
Leave me and my husband alone!
He makes it look so easy.
I told you. He's just an old friend from college...
He said he found what you called him podiatrically normative.
Clearly fake news!
He said he didn't want to be the third wheel.
He says there's one with great coffee and wifi at the bottom.
I told you we didn't need all this ridiculous gear.
Our selfie together came out really blurry for some reason.”
He said he'd introduce me to the Tooth Fairy.
You begged me to come with you, but you F O R G O T your camera!
Are you kidding? Mansplaining to yet another marginalized individual about how dominant society renders them invisible?
Greeting him in Klingon was not funny.
He'll join us in the base camp tonight  for cocktails at 6:30.
He said go high when they go low.
And yet he loves me
He says they're not open yet.
Turns out he’s fed up with the saying about men with big feet
He ate Giovanni..said he wanted a little Italian
Luckily he seems like a vegetarian.
Yet, he is an urban legend, and you're just an urban escapee.
He's not nearly as abominable as you think.
Oh yeah?  Your attitude is abominable.
Nope, he is not the least interested in coming to work for Trump.
He said get lost
He didn’t seem so abominable to me.
He's a Himalayan and I miss the Rockies - it just wasn't going to work.....
Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Yeti…whatever. Do you have anymore of those peanut butter-filled pretzels?
I guess he's gone vegan.
You promised this wasn’t going to be weird or uncomfortable!
Oh way to go Tom!... You know you really need to educate yourself on mythical creature stereotyping and how it's utilized by those in power to perpetuate a mytho-normative society."
These Aspen bigwigs and their fur coats!
Big surprise that we forgot to bring the camera.
When you said “Let’s go to the Himalayas. What’s the worst that can happen?” this is exactly what I thought the worst would be.
No, I'm not asking Sasquatch for directions.
Make sure you put "local favorite" in the review
I see you're not the only one using Viagra for altitude sickness.
I told him to stop worrying about his follower count and try connecting with people in real life for once.
I don't know. We were having a great time until I asked about that whole abominable situation.
Do something. He said abominable things to me.
He said he knows a shortcut
Really! Just someone I met at work.
So apparently "abominable" is their word.
Don't get upset, he was just asking for directions.
Well that’s a relief: he shared his wifi password
But his cave has good reviews.
Maybe he knows how to get back down, Clark!
I don't care if that's what the other explorers call him. "Abominable" isn't nice.
You said you wanted to experience new cultures.
He says conditions at the top are abominable."
I don't know.  He just grunted and took my lunch.
My Nepali is rusty...I think he said 'Hirsute Only Beyond This Point' ..
I think I now understand why you don't like asking for directions.
Apparently we’re trespassing on private property
Don’t be silly, we’re just good friends.
He looks like he knows where he’s going...should we ask him for directions?
He says, after a few seasons, your body adapts to the climate at the naturist park.
Of course he's offended. I can't believe you called him a Yeti.
He says the view from the top is worth the walk.
No, John - there actually is a mountain high enough and I’m with him now.
Lately, it seems my grip on reality is going downhill.
Is there ANYWHERE I can go where you won’t follow ?
He told me his name, yet I  don’t remember it.
He's been like that since his yak died
I told you that was Elvis that passed us at the last summit!
I wouldn't bother. I was just up there and there is not much to see.
He told me there's a Starbucks just over the next ridge!
How hard was it to find this guide?
He just takes better care of me out here
P.S., his foot isn't his biggest part.
Wait -- if that's not Larry and he's not wearing an L.L. Bean snow suit, then who is it?
He's not so Abominable!
I think we should just ask him!!
We're overdressed.
He thinks humans have a nerve calling him 'abominable'.
I feel like you're not listening to me.
He comes on to me, I say no and he walks away.  I mean, #yetisarerealmen.
“Don’t leave me like this—between a rock and a hairy place.”
Prank call. He didn’t order the pizza.
Do you mind if I join him?
Best guide I've ever had.
Just follow him. I lost the map.
You won't believe it!_They have opened a STARBUCKS at the summit!
He says we can study him, but after Wheel of Fortune.
I  promise ..this is not one of those made you look things.
I told him it was me not him.
He said the bathrooms are just up ahead.
He said we should have turned at 72nd Street.
it’s just sometimes i feel like u don’t even know he exists
Well how would you like being called abominable?
Jesus — and neither one of us brought a camera?
I'll bet you believe in the Tooth Fairy, too.
He said he’ll guide us to the top if we help tweak his personal brand.
You called him abominable? I think you hurt his feelings.
Grab your phone, this could be trending for a least an afternoon.
He says it’s the closest Starbucks.
I told you, the preferred term is Yeti.
He said we should have made a left at Everest to get to the Starbucks.
Remember how smug you were when I said I was leaving you for someone over the hill?
You hurt her feelings, you monster!
If you make me choose, I’m going with the hairy man.
He says the restaurant is on the other mountain.
Abominable! He didn’t even say hello.
He says he needs his alone time
Sorry but I can't resist a man with a hairy back.
This is definitely less touristy than the other one...
He's actually quite agreeable.
Wait. I thought YOU brought the cellphone.
Are we there Yeti?” Really
I told you not to use "low budget tours.com"
He just wanted to know if I knew any girls his age"
What's the point? We forgot the selfie stick.
WHAT did you just call me?!
He said to just go down about a mile and make a left and the coffee shop is on the right.
For a local his sense of direction is abominable.
Hold up, he forgot his phone.
Nah, that ain’t Sasquatch. He’s much more blurrier.
He is abominable. Yet I love him.
He said he’s going to get high.
Are you here for the Bigfoot meetup group?
He said he can't help us up to the summit.  Evidently, he has the flu and feels abominable.
Don't mind him, he's just neandering around.
I explained we just don’t believe he’s real.
I'm not sure this is Sherpa we started this climb with
I'm leaving you dear for the man you used to be.
It's amazing what you can see with these polarized lenses.
Calls himself "Sir Edmund Hairily...'"
I didn't mean to offend him; he just really doesn't look like a Dave to me.
He said "Because it's there."
He asked whether he's ever come to where I live to bother me.
She said that once a month she becomes the Abdominal Snowperson.
Yet he walks.
I'm staying Mick!  Sure, he only knows four words, but none of them are "Trump"!
Just follow that guy.  He seems to know where he's going.
He said, he's definitely coming back to vote in 2020.
He seems a tad more knowledgable about this place
Yet I" what?! Just say it
He'll be right back.  He thinks he left the stove on.
It might be time for prescription sunglasses.
Don’t you think there’s something weird about this mountain guide?
I'm going to be back late, Roger.
Yet he was most polite.
Sorry, Harvey.  I don't just like Bad Boys. I like the truly Abominable ones.
He's meeting his step goal.
Is it just me or is our guide a little... unkempt?
He'd take us to the summit, but he wants payment in Bitcoin.
I told you this was a clothing optional trail.
It’s only after two months of Christmas music that he becomes abominable.
It’s tacky to ask celebrities for an autograph.
He asked me to take a picture of him and his family.
Expert mountaineer, but the camera hates him.
Yes, I am going to leave you and follow him. I've decided that SIZE does matter!
His feet aren't all that big if you know what I mean.
Yeah, that guy's an animal.
No, come on . . . Let’s show once and for all that size doesn’t matter!
"He finally got the news of who won the election and he's going to sleep it off."
He says your behavior was abominable.
Small hands. Small feet. Cold weather. You do the math.
No, Dad, calling my boy friend "abominable" is racist.
No, I assure you Phil, he's just a friend.
I didn't catch his name
A whole bunch of them are protesting  this week at the summit. They've had it with  the  "Big Foot" and "Abomidable" name-calling.
He's free-range. You?
You treated him abominably.
Something about Pokémon Go.
Let it go, John! It wasn’t my worst Wednesday night.
No, no, it’s abDOMinal!  All he wanted was my pack of Tums.
Yep, we are so high!
Enough already with your foolish male pride, don't be afraid to ask for directions.
I only spoke with him for a minute but he didn’t seem abominable
Apparently he failed to trademark Yeti.
Whatever you’ve heard about us, it’s only a rumor.
If you think that's an impressive sight, wait till you get to the top.
It's easier if you follow in his footsteps.
He said there is a $20 cover charge from here.
Well maybe if you stop turning around to talk every minute, we'd catch up to him.
He was complaining about all the tabloid "fake news" about him.  I said "get in line"!
He's looking for wifi.
He said he's just a myth.
Time to turn around.
I'm sure He knows where he's going.
He did indeed call us "F#*!ing puny global warmers"--what, you're surprised?
You know that thing about big foot, big . . . not true!
Yada, Yada, Yeti. Next you'll say you see my aunt Sophie.
You hired him you follow him, I'm going home.
And that’s what can happen to you if you don’t use the proper sunscreen.
It's not what you think.  I love him.
How much do you tip a guide like him?
Should we just follow your dad?
Well, he is a bit taciturn. Yet he is more aloof than abominable.
He said we missed the turn.
Sure, we dated for awhile, but that’s over now.
I don't care about the $6 we saved, Tom.  I'm done with Craigslist.
It's been fun, but I've found someone hairier.
He's mad that we didn't call ahead to say that we were coming.
Well, I didn't find him at all abominable.
No he is the amenable snowman.
You didn’t have to go and call him a Neanderthal and all.
He asked me who shot J.R. I told him I had no idea.
He has a vacancy at his hairbnb.
He said that he couldn't believe he finally found us and couldn't wait get home and text Sasquatch the news.
I heard Mt. Everest is clothing optional, now.
Or should we tell them about the flying saucer?
The wall won't be a challenge to these guys.
Of course I looked at him when he passed by. 
Paranoid...always paranoid
I'm going with him. He's not that abominable.
May I borrow your selfie stick?
I'm not going one step further until he puts some pants on.
No, I havn't seen anything unusual.
He said we are welcome to come up to his house but he wants you to know his WiFi is on the fritz.
Really? Well I think your attitude is abominable.
Well I think he's perfectly bominable.
I asked him if there is anything we could do for him.
  He said "Not Yeti."
Wow, turns out we're not the only ones here seeking the path to enlightenment!"
He said we took a wrong turn in Bhutan.
He just wants us to go back home, and do something about all this warming.
Amateurs...
Did he just say Climate Change Deniers are abominable?
Not Yeti.
He claims he already has enough friends on social media.
Abominable” is so racist
It's not hypoxia.  He took my breath away.
I told you, Lars, I found a new guide.
You’re the one who thought having a yeti would improve our relationship!
He said he was a little lost himself,
he is trying a new path to work
I told you to use a gender-neutral pronoun.
I hate tourist season.
All I said was that he put on a few pounds. Sheesh!
He said we can follow him to the summit Starbucks.
Personally, I didn't think he behaved that abominably.
It feels like the higher we climb the more we devolve
He's the spitting image of my first husband.
You don't have to worry; paleo guys aren't my type.
The only time I forget my camera and bigfoot walks right past me!
...what luck - says there's a quaint cafe with a gift shop about a mile down from here.
Goddammit, you knew we'd had a previous relationship when you agreed to this hike!
After all this time, all he wanted was to just say hi.
He asked if I had seen a large pair of sandals.
I don't care about your getting back to nature! This is why we NEVER leave home without our phones anymore!
He said we were abominable.
I told you he wouldn't have any marijuana.
He promised an announcement on his candidacy 'very soon.'
He says the nearest Starbucks about three miles southwest...
I have to go - we are having drinks with Bigfoot and Sasquatch.
You know what else is abominable? This conversation.
Jason, believe me, we're just friends. He means nothing to me -- honestly!
Actually, he’s more adorable than abominable.
He said it's gonna be crowded up there.   They're doing a Yetti photo shoot for National Geographic.
Chad, next time we're wearing fur instead of this moisture-wicking material.
He said there's a Starbuck's at the top.
He said he's going where there are fewer tourists.
I threatened to wax him.
Sorry, Brad. Love is where you find it.
It said we can use its wifi.
You're imagining things: I've kept my affairs within our species!
Only his breath was abominable.
He wants people to know that he quit Facebook.
He's a great guide, despite the language barrier.
Something tells me to turn back.
If you would have used the politically correct term, 'Large Lower Extremity' , he wouldn't have been so offended.
At first he was angry, but then I let him know the value on his cave was about to skyrocket.
Look Todd, I just want a man with a little more mystique...goodbye.
He left the oven on.
I asked him if he’d ever considered a body wax.
Unlike you, he was gentle.
That's exactly the problem, Dan--you NEVER pay attention.
He said if we tag him he's going to unfriend us
He's a lot taller than I thought.
He said he is regretting the end of the holidays, when he has to start wearing pants again.
He wants us to pack out our poop.
It was just a one yeti stand. I'll never see him again.
It's true what they say about men with big hands and feet.
Don't worry about him - he gets an existential crisis every once in a while.
Oh, I told him we prefer to take our own selfies.
He went down seeking a wise mam and couldn't find one.
He had to leave.  He's having lunch with Nessie.
Don't ask me, I'm still working on why the chicken crossed the road.
I told you so.
Maybe a little sketchy but I wouldn’t say abominable.
I showered after him at the base of mountain.  He clogged the whole drain..
‘This is just like that old saying, “If a tree falls in a forest and no one has their camera, did it really happen?”’
He wants a better royalty deal and approval on the photographer before he'll sign.
Ask Him For Directions,He Lives In The Neighborhood!”
He says the difficult part is coming back down
I told you it said its preferred pronouns are they, them, their!"
He wants to show me something...
You are so not evolved.
I told him, waxing might help.
See, he’s not using walking sticks
TOUCHY AREN'T THEY
Speaking of abominable, we need to talk about our marriage.
He may be Abominable but when we’re together he takes me over the top.
He says there's a Starbucks up on the left.
He started back up when the new congress was sworn in.
We have to conquer some other mountain.
He may be abominable, but at least he's a man.
Go for it. He says he’s bi.
I rather have the flexibility of layering.
Did you have to say "Abominable"?
Yes, I saw him,Todd. And no, I don't think any less of you. Now can we finally focus on me?
Look...I've told you that your jealous outbursts are a sign of an overactive imagination!
Yet he persists, unlike you
It’s over Perry. I’ve moved on.
Let that be an example to you why back hair is non-negotiable.
Don't worry. He's got 5 stars on Yelp.
I thought you said he knew the way.
When we get to Sasquatch's cave, you better not start in with any of your Fox News, anti-Endangered Species Act, 2nd Amendment banter. If you do, so help me God, I will leave you here to be eaten alive.
He says he's Sisyphus, but something's wrong.
-Are we there yet?
- Not Yeti
Why can't you be more abominable?
I thought your uncle wasn't coming with us.
You can be so abominable yourself sometimes.
Honey, I swear it's not what it looks like!
Why can't you be more like that guy?
...no, I don't think this is a good time to tell him you don't beleive
His feet look so much smaller in person.
I'm leaving you, I've met someone new.
He says that he will check to see if the guru at the top can work us in.
He said the wifi password is yeticoolers.
He said the closest Starbucks is in a Walmart at the summit.
Since the Rogaine he's excersizing more...
I said we're engaged.
For Pete's sake! Can't we go on a simple date together without your Yeti friend tagging along?!
Why does Joe think no one will notice the zipper on that stupid gorilla suit?
He said the conditions up ahead are abominable
His hands are also quite large.
Rock, paper, scissors...who asks for the selfie.
Who needs a GPS? Follow that Yeti!
I was too busy trying not to sound culturally appropriative.
He said he can't be abominable until the government shut-down is over.
He told me that he’s a figment of our imagination.
He said we need to remove our shoes before we enter his home.
I’m sorry, but he just didn’t have that ‘wow’ factor I thought he would
Also a jerk. I guess I''ll just get back on Tinder.
I know he looks a little rough around the edges, but he’s got a big heart.
As far as holy men, I asked him who's at the top?   All he said was "dinner".
Way to go, you’ve hurt his feelings, again.
There will be no further statement at this time.
They said blind people couldn't scale it, but just look at us!
The docs seem to think it a testerone issue.
And I still say he flashed me.
Sorry Ralph, it's just that his feet are bigger , if you catch my drift.
23andMe said I am 2% Yeti and your mom says I’m abominable.
He'd join us but he doesn't have a thing to wear.
That was cold, Larry.
This is why I told you I prefer the Bahamas!
I told you I'd find hiking boring.
Can we go home now?
Gosh! Do you think it was something I said?
She is offended.  She says we are, 'contaminating her environment and we smell bad.'
It can't be real Bob, see, it left no footprints."
You know what they say about guys with big feet...
It's true.
No, Jeffrey.  You’re abominable!
I TOLD you you'd want to be able to post to Facebook up here!!
He said they just opened up a Starbucks Reserve up there
I'm sorry, Kevin, but this is the man I've waited for my whole life.
I'll believe in global warming when I see a Yeti in the desert...
Which part of “He’s not taking questions from the lying mainstream media” did you not get?
He’s very sensitive about his feet.
'He was nice - not abominable at all!"
JUST Loch Ness left to see.
Of course I saw him! Do you think I'm snowblind?
At least he’s not giving up!!!
Dammit.
I forgot my phone!
You're the abominable one!
Trust me. He's cold.
Of course he wouldn’t wear pants, I just didn’t think it through is all.
I think you treated him abominably!
Yes it's real fur but he was born with it
How could you forget the camera, they won't believe we reached the summit !
I​ guess it's not true​ what they say about males with big feet.
Why am I leaving you?  Size matters dummy!
He doesn't do selfies.
On his way to work, “scaring the crap out of skiers “.
Is it rude to ask for a photo?
I don't know. His feet weren't that big.
Let’s just let that one pass!
I didn‘t catch it all. Sounds like a pretty major speech impediment.
When you shave, it grows back thicker.
He doesn’t seem concerned about climate change
This Sherpa guide is way bigger than the last one.
Did you bring a plastic bag?
Well, that’s a relief. I thought we’d be underdressed.
He said it's unlikely we catch up to Sisyphus.
1) Now, do you believe me?
2) Told you so!
3) When Hairy met Sally.
That was the maitre de. He says they're ALWAYS closed on Mondays.
He said your walking stick is a bit cliche.

He says he’s going back to where it’s civilized!
How would you like to be called abominable?
Apparently he'd rather not be called abominable anymore.

I don't care who that is, I am not following that hairy butt up this mountain!
He's right - calling him that is just body-shaming.
We’re lost! Why didn’t you ask him for directions?
He says that troop 6000 stopped by yesterday, so unless we have Thin Mints we should take a hike.
I'm in love, Jake. Goodbye!

I told you that REI had a new line of natural fiber outerwear.
You never mentioned your friend Fred was an exhibitionist.
Your friends are abominable.

I feel like I'm in the middle of a New York Times crossword.
You're the Big Ape!  Now, apologize!
He told me just to tap the "Find People to Follow" option
Me? You’re the one who said, “Go take a hike.”
That's racist!

I am sorry Dave, if you get the chance to sleep with Big Foot you are not going to not do it
What did you say to piss him off?
Is this your idea of taking our relationship back to the beginning?
Of course he’s upset, you said he was abominable!
I told you we should have asked for directions!
Of course he's ahead of us.  He's got big feet!
I swear -- we're just friends.
I must say he didn't seem abominable
Now don't start something.  He's just a friend.

I didn't see any footprints...did you?
Asked only if we could change nickname from ‘abominable’ to ‘indifferent’ snowman.

It's no use, Brad.  I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
But, babe, he says he knows all the good ski spots.
It was a Tinder date that didn't work out.
Bob, we were supposed to tell him about the adoption AFTER we climbed the mountain.
The Sherpa turned back so I improvised.

It's "abominable", not "abdominal."
He'll be right back. He forgot his cooler.

What are the chances of running into each up here!
I'm leaving you for someone with more testosterone!
Now look what you've done!
I think he's adorable.
He is going to build a wall.
I fell for him when he was just Little Foot.
"....all I did was ask if he was Straight, Gay, or related to Trump."
Are Robin Williams hallucinations a sign of altitude sickness?
Of course he's angry, Zack. You keep trying to stick carrots into him.

He only asked to be called Mr. Yeti, not to debate the science behind his existence.
Yes, I'm leaving you for him because he's not into Games of Thrones.
I think he wanted to know if this is Saskatchewan...
He told me to “walk this way”.

Are you sure he's accredited by the American Mountain Guides Association?
Someone had to be his first!
See!?  I told you we would be overdressed up here.
Go ahead, ask him for a selfie!
I just want to be with someone who’s willing to let themselves be seen every once in a while.
Remember: It's not your eyes--it's the oxygen which determines what you see in the mountains.
Did you post it on Instagram?"
"I forgot my charger.
He says the queue for the hermit guru is pretty long, but at least there’s a Starbucks with wi-fi next door.
He's not happy about the pay freeze.
I'm sorry, Henry.  I know I should go home with the guy who brought me, but he is so much more exciting.

I'm looking to open a waxing studio in the area"
He says he was by far the best president yeti.
He just wanted to use my iPhone  pizza delivery.  He's getting tired of the frozen one's.
Tindr had him miles away.
You’ve obviously offended him by calling him Bigfoot
I couldn't wait for you any longer, Howard. I'm leaving you. I need a man who can keep up.  And, well, you know what they say about guys with big feet...
See, he has no walking stick!
I told him a roll in the snow was not a relationship. His 'foot' size may be spectacular but it's not enough.

He said the restaurant at the summit is abominable.
He says any white grape AOP Savoie wine at Midmountain Chalet  will be excellent.

I'm not sure either why we're in a cartoon with no possible funny caption
I don't care if he knows a shortcut, I'm tired of talking about Harry and the Hendersons.
He said the we'll get the best selfie over the next ridge.
No, the correct usage is, "Yet I saw something".
Do you think he spotted us?
No, I'm not attracted to him.  He is just the best choice for getting us to the top!
This guide is abominable - he could have at least put some pants on!

He can't find his Uggs.
He's angry because I said "Ready, Get Yeti, Go!"
He asked if we saw his friend  Bigfoot.
Everytime I come here there's nothing new to see,  just snow and more snow.
Was surprising to see the yeti, but was even more surprising to hear him whistling the theme song from Game of Thrones.
Is that him? He's much hairier than in his profile picture.
I suppose you’ll tell me the sky is falling next?
If you must know, he’s makes me laugh at 10k feet.
Of course not. He asked, but I told him I have a boyfriend.
Well, I think it's abominable of  YOU to assume it's a snow MAN.
You’re not going to believe this and don’t turn around right now...Frank is here.
He wouldn't even pose with me for a selfie, its almost like he doesn't know that if you are not on social media, you are not real
You said whoever I married would have big shoes to  fill, Daddy.

He is the least "abominable" man I have been with in years.
Yeah.  We used to hang out in high school.
He is just not used to taking criticism.
I say we just keep following him.
He's what passes for Uber up here. I gave him five stars not being talkative.
I never expected to see you here.
I hope I’m not pregnant
He prefers "Sasquatch".
He said "follow me".  Should we?
The "Abominable Snowman" was so last year, he prefers "Yeti" now!
I told him to get lost.
is this the beginning or the end of the ice age?
Climate change!
That is not NorthFace, that has Patagonia written all over it!
Yeah? I’ll tell you what’s abominable, he’s gonna get there first!
He may be fictional, but he's a real man.
What if he doesn't like having his picture taken?
Good news! He says that you aren’t imaginary!
He said he's only a size 12.
Is asking for directions really so abominable?

He said it's 'abdominal,' not 'abominable.'

They’re closed.
I swear that man passed us a mile back!
As first dates go, it was pretty abominable.
He was a Sherpa on Mom's Everest climb in 1990.
The ménage a trois was fun, but I am staying with him.
I don’t care what you think. Yelp gave this tour 4 and half stars.
He might be abominable but he's got a great WiFi connection up there!
Are you going to let him get away with that abominable comment?
Was I too much of a fanboy?
Is it just me? Or, are things getting a little hairy around here?
Sure he’s abominable but you really shouldn’t have brought up his mother
Are we almost there yeti?
Oh, so THAT'S noticeable, but my haircuts are not?
But you've always wanted an emotional support yeti.
Go back John. He had me at his first grunt!
I told you we should have done the Paleo diet.
Whaddya mean we need to see other people?
He only speaks Latin.
Your sense of direction is abominable.
He is abominable, that's why we need a border wall!
He said,"No selfies today."
Do you have any singles for a tip?
Let's follow him, he's a Thru-Hiker

Honey, don’t argue with the man ... he is the expert after all.
Sorry, I’m done with his cave man mentality.
He wants to fight you for me.
He said the end is near.
He said “see you around” but somehow I doubt that.
Of course I’m following him. Did you see the size of his feet??

He says it’s all downhill from here
He has big feet, too?
You have to hand it to LL Bean. They have some great climbing gear!
That is the last time I ask the natives for directions!
He's offended that your only recollection of him was fuzzy.
Do you really think he’s seen a bathroom?
We can still be friends and everything, but you know what they say about the size of a man's feet?
His feet don't look that big to me.

He said he's looking for some sense in the world.
He seemed a bit overly eager, but I suppose I’m game if you are.
He says the view is better on the other side of the mountain.

"He didn't even say 'hi' to us.  I heard he was abominable, but I didn't know he was rude!
Three's a crowd.
I'm sorry, Rolf.  I'm just tired of the manscaped look.
He can't find a Starbucks either.

He said he doesn’t love me anymore and he’s going home to mother
Can you believe it? He says there’s no wifi up here.
He knows the mountain all right, but I don't like a guide who grunts.
When you finally find your perfect Tinder match and she dumps you for a taller dude.
Walk THIS way
He said "Walk this way." That can be taken two ways.
It's another victim of climate change.
He stopped and asked me to text LL Bean to let them know he's not happy with their new limited return product policy."
There's no such thing as Trumpfoot.
He understands me.
If it makes you feel better then, yes, it was all about his big feet.

You’ll never believe it, but that’s my ex.

He said he needs his selfie stick first

...Yeti, yeti, yeti...yadayadayada
He said his WIFE will give us directions when she gets here. What a neanderthal!
He said his name is Sisiphos and he's  sick and tired of chasing that boulder.
No, I didn't ask where she was from. She was pretty miffed about the wording of my first question.
This is where they said they'd spotted him, right?
He says trail mix is for sissies.
Oh...he's was cool but certainly no Big Foot if you know what I mean
Maybe he's on the Paleo diet.

You know he gets touchy about his bald spot.
No no that's the Indomitable Snowman. Different guy entirely. You want to get to the top, doncha?
Seriously, I do not want to be downwind of that guy.
George, he just called my climbing technique abominable.
Wasn’t that the guy we saw arm wrestling for drinks at the bar last night?
See I told you this would be worth the Instagram.
He told me that if you add a fourth term to that right-angled-triangle theorem but for it you use a minus sign, then that is the geometry of the Universe.
Not nearly as abominable as you!
You know, he's not as abominable as everyone says.
You haven't been teasing him again have you?
Sure he'e sensitive. He's a young adult with lots of concerns about the environment and its affect on all life on earth. That doesn't make him an abominable snowflake.
He’s a marketing manager for Yeti.
You ain't seen nothin Yet...i
He could have at least said excuse me.
I must be hallucinating- thought my mother in law just walked by.
It’s the altitude; I’m seeing things also.
I told him he could possibly find shoes his size on line.
Sorry Bob, but I’m leaving with him.
At least he's willing to work on a smaller footprint.
All I said was "two's company; three's a crowd."
I’m pretty sure his directions are trustworthy.

That's oxygen deprivation for you!
He survives by bit parts in Christmas specials.

I called him Bigfoot, but he was deeply offended. It seems he's a Yeti.
He says it's not a competition.
And here I thought we had to wear layers.
Turns out they're just hairy men waiting for the look to come back.
He resents being called 'abominable'.
He was pretty  compelling, and your reasons for going back with you are ?
Oh great. Now he's going to have a meltdown.
It's over, Kevin; I never cared about the man-scaping.
She said her name is Liesl...
Back to the original Man Cave?
Sorry Darling. I've been meaning to tell you
Whoa. Did you see the size of that guy’s feet?
He expressed discomfort with the idea of a threesome.
He says he's only a size 14 but his uncle has a really big foot.
The regular guru is off Wednesdays.
We haven't hiked together since he behaved so abominably the first time.
She saw her shadow. Looks like you white guys have another ten years.
I don’t think he’s abominable at all.
Back off, Jared. He's my dad, and I don't care if he has a full-body comb-over.
He gave me the secret for eternal life. The problem is I don’t know Sasquatch.
He's not really abominable, you know. He's just pissed
at the paparazzi.
He knows where he’s going, Eric! Just look at him, I’m pretty sure he’s a native.
Your jealousy is abomidable.
Bringing the camera definitely would have weighed us down
Yah...I saw his lair but when I tried to start a fire he said it would just never work out between us.
Apologize. Yeti is their word.
I’m not taking another step until he stops singing ‘Ice Ice Baby’.
He's invited us for lunch.
He may be abominable but it's overwhelmingly evident he's also a stud.
We’re just at different points in our lives”
That is the last time we bring your father along. I don't think he's funny.
It's his 30-day Challenge.
He said he feels naked - he's off to get his sunglasses.
Wow, you are the LAST person I thgouht I'd run into on this adventure.
He’s still looking for Bigfoot.
I told him no means no
Who knew he does Sherpa work on the side?
And yet I... And yet I...  I forgot what I was going to say.
It's your turn to small talk with him.
No worries, he’s breaking trail.
He says he knows the best place for us to take a selfie.
Can't believe I fell for the stereotypes.
I think he knows where he's going.
No wonder he’s insulted, after what you called him.
It’s abominable of me, but I’m leaving you, Tim.
Didn’t I tell you to charge the phone before we left?
You really can’t expect him to wear the red suit and hat all year long
Hirsute or Hair suit?
I can’t believe he wouldn’t give us directions.
He's says it's okay but no Trump jokes.
The sherpas are all on strike.
Nothing is Abominable in Trump Times
To go any higher,I need my Support Yeti.
He said he’s going back for something a little warmer.
He gave me a message for Matthew Whitaker.
I paid extra to hike the "Evolution Trail"
He says he's related to Donald Trump, but that we shouldn't hold that against him.
He unfriended me.
Typical Conroy: you bring your selfie stick and leave your camera at the hotel!
I wanted to walk a mile in his shoes, but I couldn't find any size 28s.
He said to go back down and get him razors,shave cream and wine.
He's already signed a 4-picture deal.
Yeah, so he says to make two lefts and then a right to get to the Marriott.
Bigfoot without the footprints?
What do you mean you didn't ask him to take a selfie with you?
But you promised, no family!
He's out of granola bars, but he's gonna check if he has any Gatorade.
No that's cool, you can wait dong here. I mean down hairy. I mean down here. Just set up cock. I mean camp. It'll be all white. Sigh. SEE YOU FIVE MINUTES.
This hike will put some hair on your chest
At least he doesn't complain about the altitude.
What's that abominable smell?
Yes, it incredible that he's a Yeti, but can you believe there's a Starbucks up ahead!
And YET-I can't believe what I just saw!
He said he's fed up with being "othered."
Looks like what they say about big feet is true after all.
But we were only talking
OK, it stopped being funny the third time you asked me if i'm enjoying the view!
This may not be the best time to tell you that I met someone who is changing my path
Now I understand why he is always so hard to track . . . . he doesn't leave any tracks in the snow.
Yeah, he may be abominable, but at least he isn't you.
He turned around as soon as I mentioned #MeToo.
That new Patagonia fur suit really proves to be warm in this climate!
He dumped me because I had better hair.
Actually, we met at Starbuck's.
He says he’ll eat us at the top.
Can you believe it!  After 9 hours, my wash-and-wear slacks have kept their crease!
Yes, there is someone else!
We can point fingers and assign blame or we can be mature adults and admit we always knew it would come to this.
He said once we reach the summit we should pop over to his place and his wife will get us a nice cup of tea.
He said he came here because it's here.
I swear if you yell out “Look out for that Yeti!” one more time...
Actually, his feet aren't that big
No. I’ve told you a dozen times, that Sasquatch joke is offensive!
How many times do I need to tell you, Bigfoot isn't real, there are no UFOs, and my sculpting is not just a hobby!
He wants to invite us over for dinner.
Seems like a shy guy, I guess he got cold feet.
The lengths we go for good signal.
I don't know how he does it without a GPS . . .
Look, all I’m saying is 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor and an endorsement for ‘excellent conversation’ isn’t everything.
See, by staying in the here and now, you don’t miss what’s going on right under your nose.
Look, I get that you’re a sensitive, woke male. But at 14,000 feet, I’ll take 7 foot of hairy, pure testosterone.
Well, first off his wardrobe is simpler
He could've been spared the back hair comments.
He didn't find me abominable enough.
Go back.  We missed a turn.
Do you think he knows we're following him?
My new fitness instructor - the abdomenal snowman.
God damn tourists!
Maybe we should have continued the paleo diet any way.
He promised me it's a farm-to-table restaurant.
These sunglasses are great, but I feel we're missing out on the big picture.
I am so turned on!  Let's never shave again!
He climbs like an animal.
He said he won't play college football unless he's paid.
I didn't even know there was a mobile home park up here.
He said it's pronounced 'global warning' not 'global warming.'
It's a big feat, making it to the top.
Don't you love being alone with nature?
The only abominable thing about him is his attitude.
Nice guy, but wouldn't let me take a photo.
Let's get some attention and report it as fake news.
I hate to disagree with you, but if he really was the Abominable Snowman, don't you think he'd be leaving footprints in the snow so we'd have proof?
Now who you goin' to believe?  Me, or your lyin' eyes?
Well, at least his sense of direction isn't abominable.
Abominable" is an adjective, not a proper name, you goof.
Wow, Mike, that remark was cold, even by his standards.
I tried to explain why he shouldn't wear fur, but he told me he was more concerned with global warming!
Fake news is everywhere.
Never mind. He always does this when people are around.
He says he's with the Von Trapp family.
yeti shmeti his breath stinks
You can't compare yourself.  He lives here.
Goodbye, John. Oh, one more thing. I could never stand your aftershave.
I'm not sure why he wanted our hats.
I know, right. What a show-off .
He didn’t seem so bad.
..Well your hairy snowman remarks definitely upset him.
I met him at the co-op, isn't he cool?
Are we there yeti?
I think you have to believe before you can see.
If I understood him correctly, he says global warming sucks and his feet really aren't that big!
No, in fact he's quite personable.
That sure was a chilly reception!
He said to just follow in his footsteps
Really, Helen.....a Yeti?
He’s such old Fake News.
Wait. Julie Andrews is still alive?
Well, his feet are big.
He's not really that abominable and it's a great workout.
He said mountain climbing has strengthened his midriff. so much, he's now the Abdominal Snowman.
Well, the brochure didn't mention anything about this.
He was just wondering if Ronald Reagan was still president!
Well.. from his perspective I’m aiming lower by choosing to date you
He's tired of people commenting on his feet.
If you were looking for Bigfoot he's that-away. This here is a yeti.
On His Instagram He Looks Bigger ...
Turn back! This is my peak experience.
I guess that means no selfies.
He's from our tour, but they made him fly cargo.
Really, Jason. You hurt his feelings. He’s a little slow—but “abominable”?
This hike is of mythic proportions
Don't worry. It's not serious.  He's not even my species.
Dear John, it's complicated ...
If I wanted to date a Neandatrhal I would not have gone hiking with you!
Come on. He's the most highly recommended sherpa in the entire region. 4-5 stars in all the rating guides.
We're invited to tonight's snowball fight.
Don't worry, no one knows the Canadian border better than this Sasquatch.
Actually, it's your pace that is abominable.
Definitely worth the extra charge.
I told him it's called the Paleo diet fo a reason.
Boy,talk about your cold shoulder.
-You- tell him to shave his back
Trust me, his tours are one of a kind.
It’s a beast of a climb!
He’s largely unknown but keeps winning by a landslide.
Did you understand what he said?
I told you we should have brought the go pro
No, I wouldn’t say this is a hairy situation
He said he wasn't photogenic.
He says it's a stupid hobby.
I see everything's in proportion...
I'm sorry to end things, Brad, but I've always dreamed of dating a yeti.
We can go up, but no selfies are allowed.
He said the Starbucks will be open at 7.
He doesn't look that abominable !
Steve, I'm going with him because I'm a geneticist...and I won' t mix business with pleasure.
I'm sorry, Bill.  It's the big feet
Border security just isn't an issue that I am passionate about.
He called use abominable people.
He said no selfies
He is upset that he receives no royalties from the premium cooler company that bears his name.
We've been wandering for three hours following your GPS -- excuse me if I ask a local for directions to the brunch place.
It’s fine Jack. King Kong was a one-time thing.
Sorry, Jeff. The yeti has WiFi, so I'll try not to make this awkward.
He looks like he knows where he's going....
I didn't find him abominable at all.
Because he has bigger hands!
I think Ancestry was right - -and my Father and Uncle both had big feet.
He wants me to go ahead with him, and you to go back for more beef jerky.
He's going ahead for a tidy up. He says his house is abominable.
You forgot the cash?  He won't sign without an advance.
Sorry. He's sensitive about his back hair.
He said he was leaving 2018 behind with the rest of his gear.
That suit looks warm. Wonder where he got it.
He said take the next crevice on the right
No, there's no such thing!
He said it’s only a few miles before we reach the Starbucks.
She just wants to be alone.
John,   That beautiful creature just exposed himself to me
Guess he doesn't shop at R.E.I. for outerwear.
He's just the Yeti Welcoming Committee. You meet the whole clan at the top.
Carl, your jealousy is going to ruin this relationship.
Follow him? He's not even wearing hiking boots!
Orange hair?
He said, "Humanity is just too crazy to believe in.
I can't believe you forgot to close the garage.
I don't care if you never see him. 
This was supposed to be just the two of us.
I told him keep going, ya can't miss it!
He wasn't going to let us continue until I convinced him we understand that global warming is a serious problem.
He took it pretty well. Just said, 'he's got big shoes to fill.'
Of course he's not going to pose for a selfie with you!
He has got to get his steps in
He says, "Abominable is as abominable does."
He said the best is Yeti to come!
I thought so too, but he said he's just a Sherpa.
Let's trust him--I'm sure he knows the way.
John, I'm sick of your pranks- the yeti is not real!
She said she'd go back up and get my hiking stick for me.
Wow! did you have beans for lunch or what?
False alarm, it wasn't Bigfoot. Just someone who really liked no-shave November.
This guy is the best sherpa ever!
He said his place is just over the top and he'd love to have us come by for a drink if we'd care to.
His climbing skills are legend.
I’m tired of Gortex. I’m thinking of giving real fur a try.
Streaking on Mt. Everest? come on!
He just needed to use my cell for a quick call. Said he lost his down a crevasse last week.
We had a great conversation... I think he's just misunderstood.
Well if you didn't want to follow the Sasquatch to their lair, then why did you come along?
That confirms it, the yeti just told me climate change doesn’t exist.
I wouldn't call it a thing.
He didn't even say hello
He said the air's abominable down there.
He's requested a mountain summit meeting. I hope there's coffee.
Big feet, big hands....
He got offended when I  called him “abominable.”
His climbing skills are unreal.
Is that J. Peterman he's wearing?
He says follow him if you want to meet the Leprechauns of the Himalayas
He said he wants to play us some tracks from his new mixtape. He goes by the name Lil Yeti.
I am sorry Brad, but he‘s my King Kong
And yet, my mom thinks you’re the abominable one!”
Do you have a better plan?
He was actually very pleasant.
Next time I hire the guide...this guy is loathsome.
Thank god for your beef jerky, I thought I was a goner!
I think he said, "Wus."
Apparently, he knows a great selfie spot.
I’m leaving you because he’s not afraid to be real.
No, I can't place where I've seen him before.
Abominable? No, he's one of Trump's deplorables.
It’s me not you, I found a real man!
Ok..so he didn’t yield to the downhill skier..yell at him.
Well, that's the last we'll see of him.
Your right, my mom is hairier.
He clearly didn't receive the 'no wearing white after Labor Day' memo.
He said he used to be President, but wasn't appreciated for the stable genius that he was.
"I'm sorry, but there's just something about him I find appealing."
Can you believe he’s not on Facebook?
He totally confused hirsute and hairsuit.
He's had it with "civilization".
If the Yeti doesn't need a hiking partner, neither do I!
See?  It's not just me; only Julie Andrews can sing that song properly.
Such obsolete gear.
We need to tell President Pence right away! We found the runaway president!
I told him we're vegan...
Your stupid hair loss joke scared him away
He is not "abominable!"  But he is shy.
It's not you, it's him, you idiot.
There’s nothing abominable about him, and touring the Himalaya with a native could be
unforgettable.
He said to bring orthotics.
He wanted to know if we were interested in a reverse mortgage
No, he's very pleasant. A little shy maybe but he'll get you to where you want to go.
We seem to have trouble making friends.
He decided to be upwardly mobile -- global warming isn't his thing.
He just said there is nothing much to see up there
It's a sign-- we should buy the cooler.
He just called me "abominable" and walked on.
The dress code up here is abominable.
I think he expects a tip.
The region's best waxer is located just over the next ridge.
It's been nice.
He invited us up for a party, but I think it will be abominable.
Thank God we are blind!
A guy that smelly MUST be ugly.
Your turn to go second. I am fed up with the view.
Calling him abominable was uncalled for.
He says there's a cybercafe up 3 miles
Are you kidding me?  He wouldn’t even make eye contact!
And we thought we needed all that climbing equipment.
You didn't have to insult him!
Don't you come here with that "I told you so".
Don't even mention this when we get back.  They'll just say it was altitude hallucination.
I'd call you abominable for getting us lost, but it'd be an insult to the guy who stopped to ask us for directions.
He just comes down occasionally to appear on reality shows.
Wow! Unbelievable! I'm in Park Slope, too!
Quick! Get a picture of his footprint!
He's really upset you won't share your beef jerky.
I hope you're taking plenty of mental pictures, Gary.
He said you’re whistling too loudly.
Strange. He was reciting that famous Robert Frost poem as he passed us.
Why is it rude to ask him for a selfie?
Steroids.  He wins but can't compete.
He was  3 feet taller before global warming kicked in...
Why on earth did you say we’d play freeze tag with him?
He’ll be right back. He forgot it’s his turn to bring the snacks.
I asked for a guide who knows this terrain for a million years.
He says he has a camera we can use.
What if the yellow snow writing message was his?
When he said "no selfies",he meant no selfies!
He got pissed when I told him I was already seeing someone...
I think he said 'Hey--you kids get off my slope!'
He said hi and you ignored him. How abominable!
He smiled and winked at me--ergo, he's 'abominable?'
I told you not to mention ICE in front of him.
It's your turn behind"Sweet Cheeks"
Don't be a baby...but he really does have big feet if you know what I mean.
Not even a "hello"!  Abominable!
I told you not to say anything about the size of his toes.
He was here first
Apparently every guy does have a size issue...
Should we turn around? He said we’re going the wrong way.
That’s something you don’t see every day.
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
He’s just not that into us.
Don't engage ... keep talking ... he's almost gone.
No matter how far we travel, we just can't seem to get some me and you time.
I declined his request for a date and he left in a huff
... swiped right on Tundra!
Did he seem abominable to you?
Finally, someone has decided to take the high road!
Sorry, Mr. Yeti doesn't like his picture taken.
You never believed in me either,really.  I'm not going back with you,I'm staying here with him.
How could you give him your credit card?
Are you high?!?
Toxic masculinity
I told him you were only into bears.
I told you we didn't need this much gear.
He said it's abominable
weather at the top."
I told you not to drink that water.
Ok. Yes.  I have always hated the waxing.
He really has had it with the whole "abominable thing".
He’s just going to freshen up before dinner
Go tell him we were here first.
I had to break up with him. The relationship was becoming abominable.
Just give him a minute... He has a shy bladder.
I think we're heading into the Ice Age.
I  told you he answers to “yeti” not “abominable”
Why would you turn down a dinner invitation? Even the Hendersons are coming.
No, we are not there Yeti.
He is flattered but isn't interested in becoming the podiatry college mascot.
I knew we wore too many layers.
He said you were good for the lift ticket...
He says we're both fired, and he'll be in his penthouse
He said it's harder going downhill.
Rarest of breeds.  Recessive strain.  Non-Abominable.  Best guide ever
My Yetish are a bit rusty. I think he said "Gwargglgh".
He's the best sherpa I could afford.
We're underdressed. That's our problem.
You heard me; I'm leaving you!
He said it’s just a little bit further.
And you said, "There's no such thing as a YILF," didn't you, Brad?
He said our price range is a few hundred feet higher.
Oh, come on.  He says it's just a short distance to the top.
He's called "Bigfoot," not "Sasquatch," Trevor.  Don't you know anything?
Yeti does have a certain air about him....
Catch you later, loser.
The listing did say we'd have a superhost.
Did you see that?"
"Nope."
He said Shangrila was two mountains to the West.
He really needs some manscaping.
...and the guide’s an animal, Jerry.
It’s over.
He’s mad that Bigfoot got the Animal Planet show.
Are we there Yeti?  Are we there Yeti?  Are we there Yeti
I'd never go hiking in a fur coat.
They should call him BigBUTT!
You need to tell Jeff he is taking this hipster hair-thing too far.
Honey, we've been invited to hi-tea with the Yeti
He's not seeing anybody.
Abominably cute, I'd say.
If your ancestor can make it to the top, so can you!
You go ahead, I have to send a tweet.
Now who is calling who abominable!
Me Jane!
It's an uphill battle to attempt Everest blind, but I can tell something big is afoot.
No, you're the one who's abominable."
Leave nothing but footprints.
I'm blind, but YET-I see.
Having walked behind him for 8 miles, I can now tell you exactly where he gets his name and why they chose to have it rhyme with abdominal......
It was only a one night stand.
See, we didn't need shoes or gear!
He says we should have turned left 2 snowdrifts back....
He doesn't like to be called 'Frosty' either.
i have a feeling he isn't taking us to the beach.
One small step for man......
That’s all I heard.
Are you following me?
Do these pants make my ass look fat?
The big guy said he really needed a cup of coffee and directions to the nearest Starbucks.
I know he's angry, but I am not giving him my last Clif Bar.
He forgot his selfie-stick.
He said we're too pretty to eat.
That was the most amazing kiss. Now we'd better do as he said and turn back.
He asked us to say hello to his cousin on Mount Shasta.
Don't worry, he won't get far on foot.
You ready?”
 “Not yeti!
For someone who can’t even speak English, he’s a remarkable tour guide.
Which way is progress?
It's a yeti, not a yogi.
So I swiped right.  You have a problem with that?
What is it about men and asking for directions?! He may know if there is a tea house up there.
I meant the lack of footprints, but, yeah, that's another weird problem with this virtual reality program.
What's with all the yellow snow around here ?
He needed an update on the current generation of world leaders
Abominable Snowman or Bigfoot? How would he know!?
Well I WAS seeing other people....sort of.
I suggest you turn around.
He said he's sorry for the mess and that he'd be back after theTrump Shutdown. Oh, and to call a plumber.
Bigfoot?! Yeti?! Sasquatch?! Why the racist inquisition?
Clear up something for me.  Is it "Abdominal" or "Abominable"?
He says that the abominable snowman is just an urban legend."
Exactly, who’s evolved?
I’m going with him!!
He said the Starbucks is this way.
He's going to Starbucks. You want a latte?
I'm going down. What do you think they eat up there?
He was sizing me up so I told him to take a hike.
Male: That’s amazing!
Female: Yeah! No footprints!
He says he's a yeti not the Abominable Snowman, he's the next mountain over.
He's getting me a cooler.
We have big footprints to fill
He forgot his cell phone.
You need to talk to your brother about hygiene, he's abominable.
You called him "Abominable." Now we will never see him again.
It's shocking. Even after eight episodes of Star Wars this Chewie guy doesn't speak any proper English.
He's not a sherpa?
You look better dressed then the last guy I met
Yes, in fact he is better in bed. He’s better at climbing. He can handle the snow better. He’s better all around. So you can turn right around and leave, but I’m following him. And, I’m staying here.
You are wrong!  I am sure he knows the way down.
Some of the people who hike this trail are abominable!
Sorry, I prefer his leadership style to yours.
Look if he’s not cold it’s his decision!
Carl commits yet another Yeti faux pas.
I know it's uncomfortable having my ex around,but he really wanted to come!
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone with the dating app screen name: "Hairy"
I told you Carol, we don’t need to ask for directions.
pff....tourists
Sasquatch just broke my stick.  What are ya goin’ to do about it?
He said we are expecting snow tonight.
He said he's just passing through.
He needs some space, just learned his grandchild was human!
No, the view is not worth it.
He is off to the spa to get waxed.
He said for us to tun back. It's abominable up there.
He said "the borscht in the lodge is not fit for man or beast."
I told you I stopped seeing him.
He said he likes to run his 10K on K2.  I said K.
He came highly recommended at the local tourism desk.
He said its a 20 minute wait.
He's checking the border wall.
He said climate change is making this weather abominable.
Y'know, gotta hand it to Tim. Sure, he might not fit in back at the pub, but out here?...
The only thing abominable about this climb is your attitude!
He'll be right back with the sleds.
Wild man, Neanderthal, Big Foot - Nah. He's just a normal guy who has given up trying to find clothes that fit.
Did you see what I just saw? He wasn’t wearing Patagonia.
I know he'll get there; not so sure about you.
Remember; we're here to prove the Earth is flat.
I asked - but he said he’s only seen grainy footage of an REI
All I did was ask him what kind of shaver he uses.
Well, he isn't exactly what he appeared to be on Tinder, but hey - sometimes you just got to go with your gut.
Has it ever occurred to you to be just a little abominable?
The sherpas weren’t available...
He said he's OK with the horns : but the yodelling is abominable !
For the last time, Kevin, WHAT sherpa?!
Was it really necessary to compare him to the abominable snowman?
I told him it wasn't him, it was me.
Now you’ve done it. You know Harry’s sensitive about his large feet.
Now you know what it's like when tourists try to get directions from you.
He forgot his cell phone up there.
Larry you are the one being abominable
Tuesday is cardio.
He said something about Trump being more disliked than he is
Real original, like he hasn't heard a 'you know what they say about people with big feet' joke before!
Well, now I know why he's called 'abominable.'
Hey, there’s room on this mountain for more than one monster.
What's it to you, John! Go back to your IPO!
His name is not Yeti, and I don't want to hear any more of this Stockholm Syndrome crap.
Is it the lack of oxygen?
Now that’s my kind of man, Ted.
Of course he looks sad. His girlfriend called him abominable.
Don't worry, I told him we're lawyers.
You're exhausted? He hasn't stopped since he left Africa.
He said no backpacks allowed
Sasquatch my eye, let's keep trekking.
The locals aren't all that friendly.
He'll throw in free Wi-Fi at the Yeti Lodge.
He said he wanted to have us over for lunch.
I said "No, I won't marry you, and then he just turned and walked away."
''I think he's squatching us.''
He’s not actually abominable and he’s not actually a snowman, which is more than I can say for you, Ted.
He's going to get his underpants.
Turns out Trump’s doppelgänger is equally abominable.
He says we made a wrong turn two glaciers back.
He told me to tell you he thinks your sense of direction is abominable.
Well at least we know there’s somebody looking for us.
Well . . .it wasn't so bad for a one-night stand.
I guess he’s sick of Yeti puns.
He said he's sick of being called "Abominable."
Am I going to die? That was on my bucket list!
Ted, I'm gonna myth you.
Quoth he, 'Get off my lawn.'
Didn’t we see him in the Sahara desert last year - or was it Monte Carlo?
I don't believe it, but yet he is.
Apparently the WiFi is really bad up here.
He was so much shorter in person!
He says he finds hikers abominable
You didn't want to bring your camera and now he's laughing at us.
Abominable Shrinkage.
He is not as abominable as your down vest.
To call him Big 'Foot' is, I think, quite a misnomer.
Another policy adviser for the Far Right I think.
glad you could meet me early.  that last date was a bit hairy!
Can't be, his feet are too small
Another guide quitting on us?! You do realize a good mountain guide's harder to find than Bigfoot!
How many years has Bill been out here climbing this mountain?
He said his wife thinks he's cute.
He said he didn't want to hear the good news.
He wanted directions to the nearest Starbucks.
The coffee's great but the service is abominable.
He said conditions on the summit are abominable.
Sure you see Yeti.  And I just saw Santa Claus fly by with 8 tiny reindeer!
Did you really have to ask him why he was being so abominable ?
He agrees, Todd. Your behavior HAS been abominable.
Why shouldn't I go with him? You don't even have a mustache.
Sure he smells awful, but you didn't have to say so. Now you've offended him.
Oh sweet mystery of life at last I found him.
He’s going vegan for January.
I told you the other tour guide would be better!
Have you heard any news today? That was either Yeti, or Donald Trump has been impeached.
I told him we have a right to be here--it's a National Park!
My phone is out of battery. How about yours?
The locals are so rude
He said to take the A -Train uptown.
Could be, but I'm not convinced Yeti.
He's having an existential crisis.
He quit me but I can’t quit him.
He really didn’t take it well when I told him
we were engaged.
Forget it, I’m not going to take my clothes off!
Remember, we are following on the footsteps of giants who came before us.
Why did you give him the cold shoulder?
He's lost and he will not ask for directions.
He's just so abominable!
I didn't like him at first either, but the cuddling is awesome!
There was nothing abominable about him.
Told you we took a wrong turn.
Look, he came prepared - I told you to grow your body hair out!
He's going to check on his soufflé
Really, Chad? Your #furreal selfie bomb couldn’t wait until summit?
An avalanche? I mean, what 're the odds?
He doesn't look like he's lost.
You better apologize right away - it's not a "gorilla suit" !
I told you he was very sensitive about his shoe size !
Yet I see.
He's such an antisocial climber.
Well, do YOU think I'm abominable, too?
We're in luck, he said he can help us find the rare high-altitude hummingbird.
He is mumbling about the futility of pushing snow balls up the mountain
Yeah, he's hairy, but he's not a quitter.
He was very pleasant and just said, that he prefers "Sassy" to "Big Foot."
I told you to never ask him for a selfie.
And whom are YOU calling 'abominable'?
He says we're totally overdressed for the occasion.
Trump isn't president where he lives!
No, apparently, “Sherpa” is considered insensitive.
If Bigfoot can do it without a pole, so can I.
Oh no, not another banished West Wing casualty…
He said he needed to unplug
bigfoot doesn't understand the fuss, he 's only a size 12
He is not just "another guy."
Just another climate science denier.
Yeah, that's the latest in climbing gear - warm, waterproof and washable
Should we tell him he's going the wrong way? No, not Yeti.
Yeti, yeti, yeti
I found him on yelp. All the reviews said he is the best Sherpa
My therapist said I should get more exercise and ignore needless distractions.
Another blind date gone off the rails!
He's only interested in eating us if we're 'gluten free"
See, even he's not using any of that expensive YETI gear!
He is not abominable!
No, John. You're the abominable one in this relationship.
Maybe we should’ve packed so many mushrooms
Everyone has a New Year's resolution to get into better shape.
Maybe he knows where we are...
Not just bigger; better.
But he is my type.
I can't believe you were that rude.
He asked if I had a cigarette!
I asked her where she bought her fur,
It's abominable how he always has to be first in everything.
You've upset him, Marvin. There was no need to comment on his hairy back.
Yeah, he's been on the move since climate changed
I told you to call him Henry, NOT Harry!
He came all this way and you only left him a $3 tip?
He just happens to be in front of me, I'm not following him.
You know, I think he really is on the up and up.
Please stop calling him abominable! His name is Yeti.
I'm his new social media strategist. Can you follow us on Instagram?
Did you let him know there’s no toilet paper in the men’s?
He said the final stretch is abominable.
You've never been a team player.  Now you've alienated our guide.
He says he's sorry but there's no vacancies up there.
Do you remember, should we call him the Adorable Snowman, or the Agreeable Snowman?
I think he said that is the way to enlightenment.
Well... that wasn't abominable at all!
Ugh. His attitude was just abominable.
Shrinkage?
He said there isn't a good seafood restaurant around here.
I know, I know. He always has to be first.
You know what, Doug? Hey - look at me when I’m talking to you! I wanted one thing out of this week - one thing - to see a Yeti! So I’m sorry - my eyes are here, Douglas - I’m sorry if I’m a little cranky about that!
He’s really not that abominable.
He said he needs to ask the guru a question.
Just follow the big footprints.
I told you he didn't like granola bars . . .
I’m sorry to leave you like this Roger - I just feel I’m destined for higher things...
Hikers debate Bigfoot's invitation for tea and crumpets.
What a sweetheart. He's invited us for tea!
I'm not saying it will be a picnic.
Spotted him at SoulCycle last week too—he’s training for a half marathon and won’t shut up about it.
You don't have to follow him to the ends of the earth just because he's your DNA ancestor.  He is everyone's DNA ancestor!
You tell him that he needs to use a pole!
His mother sent him to ask if we had a cigarette she could bum.
I think I hurt his feelings by asking him if he was the "Abominable Snowman".
My eyes are down here!
For the last time John, there is no Yeti!
I thought you meant you were bringing your cooler!
No he’s chilling
He said he's not abominable, and wants me in his snow cave.
He says there’s a snowstorm coming, he ought to know
Bigfoot just shaded him online.
For god sake Jerry, he's not even wearing shoes.
I told him there’s snacks at the top.
Why did you ask him to take a selfie?!
I knew we shouldn't have gone with the local travel agency!
Guess that Washington job didn't work out.
He’s upset about not getting credit for fake news.
The view is unbelievable!
He said he'll be right back.
Wow, our tour guide really knows the area!
I feel we aren't getting the full experience without the Park Rangers.
He took my Yeti water bottle.
Actually, I think the real issue here, Steven, is your casual labeling of a, noting your casual gender assumption, by the way,"snow-person", as "abominable" purely from your own euro-centric cultural viewpoint."
Don't follow him, he's just going to take a leak.
This could be a turning point
Well, should we follow him?
You think it was my perfume?
No matter what, Roger, I'm committed to you.
He said, if we follow him, he'll make us coffee.
Oh geez, and here come the Hendersons.
I can’t stand our mountain guide. He’s just abominable!
If we stick with this guy,we can become legendary.
I can't believe it just passed us without saying hello!
That's Muhammad...he  finally decided to give in and go to the mountain.
Well I think your manners are abominable.  It's not so nice to hear is it?  And you wonder why he's walking away.
With him, there is no tugging over the blanket in bed
The relationship didn't work out.  It was great at first, but I don't have enough hair.
I'm surprised he doesn't have the Secret Service with him.
I only asked him who cuts his hair.
Dunno if it's 10,000 steps yet
It’s a little hairy up there.
this was a waste of grant money, he says he's a republican.
Bigfoot, my foot!
He said he found “downers” like us abominable
Last to the top is a Loch Ness monster!
He wanted to know whether we came across his yeti cooler.
NO! He is not a BI-POLAR-BEAR! YOU are Passive Aggressive.
See you around, Roger. You know, I always did like them hairy.
Now don't you wish you had real camera!
Go back?  Now who's being abominable?
I'm fine,  but he's upset Elizabeth Warren didn't mention she's related to him too!
Well this guy sure makes it look easy..
I told him he wasn’t likable either.
I’m breaking up with you Carl and going with Big Foot.  You know what they say, big feet, big ……………...….. shoes.
Climate change is a hoax, just like the Abominable Snowman.
Says he wants Air Jordans . . . in a twenty-four!
Hun, the paleo diet seems to help.
He said, "No, you have big feet."
He wanted to know if we had any spare sunscreen
Bob, I'm leaving. He's realer than you could ever be.
No, that's not the elusive Yeti. That's my husband and he refuses to shave his back."
Yeah, we keep telling him streaking is out of date.
Maybe we should have texted before we came over.
He had no idea where the REI is!"
You’ve hurt his feelings. Try coming up with a different description,
Don't judge!  I'm sure you've walked out on somebody sometime.
He may look like Yukon Cornelius but he smells French.
He was hoping we had his book-of-the-month package.
He's going to take a quick selfie at the top.
He said thanks for making him famous.
What's abominable is your step count!
You think he'll tell anyone about the three-way?
"No, Ken, it was not just a microaggression."
He said his name is "Sissy Foots".
That hike must take longer than we thought.
And you call me abominable?
He says he can't come out of hiding until we build 'The Wall.'
He’s just being abominable.
He says we can come up for selfies if we bring some avocado toast for him to try.
Wow, that dude is radically ultralight--no pack, no gear, no clothes!
Not a Yeti - just an over-enthusiastic hipster
He was actually quite friendly.
Conditions up the mountain are white with a full moon.
I can't wait till we reach the peak , the view has got to be a lot better then the one on the way up.
Well, you always said you wanted to swing.
Don't wait for me....I'm in love
This 'hobby' of yours is getting in the way of our relationship.
I think he belongs to anther climbing group.
Well, it's big, and it's a foot, but he doesn't walk on it...
I’d like to see what happens if we turn down his invitation
What do you expect, you're inside a photoshopped image.
I told you I wanted seclusion. What is this, the Catskills!?
Let’s follow him. He seems to know this place like the back of his furry hand.
He said the weather is abominable at the summit and we should head back.
The view's great but the commute is abominable
It's over Mark, I've clearly moved on.
Of course he is fast! Without bags....
Don't look he's just showing off....
No John, I'm staying with Harry.
‘’It's a male thing. He came here all the way from the Himalayas to climb to the top of our Mt. Everest to beat his chest and roar."
I think all this gear is slowing us down.
How did we end up inside the Toblerone logo?
He's not THAT abominable
Put the paint away.  He says it's fake fur.
I lost him at "Netflix and...".
Yeah, I suppose we probably should have selected a different sherpa
You just HAD to cook chili last night!
I'm leaving with him.  You're abominable!
I want to follow him - you fly back and scoop the Times.
What a waste. He doesn't even speak English.
Ok, I admit it - we definitely overpacked.
We're getting closer to the russian collusion evidence
I told him I didn't have any spare change.'
All he said was, '"Why's it taking so long to get a Starbucks up here?"
Our guide has gotta be seen to be believed!
Yup, abominable indeed -he thinks pineapple makes a fine pizza topping.
I think our tour guide is a bit harried.
My eyes are over here!  I saw you glance over at her... so rude.
I thought you said big feet were a hindrance to mountain climbing!
I took the honest approach.  He's just not my type.
I'm going with him, Jeff.  I'm sick of your sniveling namby-pamby PC equality crap.
It’s an abominable hike up, but the view’s not bad.
I think 'abominable' means 'hung like a horse'.
I’ve had it with your jealousy!
Look, it’s so easy even a caveman can do it!
He says there is nothing interesting up there!
I told you to ask for directions sooner, he said we should have taken a left at the last pass.
Is he a Yeti?  We'll have to see how he signs the summit log book.
Okay rumpled, but did you see he’s doing it without crampons.
Worst Sherpa ever! Can this trip get any more abominable?
Our Yeti Lyft just left.
The travel agency wasn't kidding when they said this holiday would be unbelievable!
I know Jim, I’m just as surprised we made it this far without a Sherpa
Actually I found him kind of lovable.
Cbd IS hallucinogenic!
That's what you meant when you said "there's a force out there bigger than both of us" ?
He gave me the finger!
He said he was once president of the United States and wants to make a deal.
He’s running up to get his shoes. He’ll meet us there.
He may be a myth... but he's all myth to me.
You know, he was really quite pleasant.
We used to date. On the surface, he appears abominable and cold. Yet, he has a warm heart.
He's mine!!
Craig’s list has some good deals but this is a lot of work to get a discount sofa
So yes, I did met him yesterday.
He's really a very nice guy
Someone beat both of us to the top and he was barefoot
They reject our offer of $12 in beads for the mountain and are establishing a YouCaring page to fight gentrification of the neighborhood.
Yeah, I got some great conditioner reccomendations.
He's offended by the name Abominable, he prefers LL Cool A.
His feet don't look so big to me.
He's having a bad hair day.
I'd say he was more curt than anything.
He keeps forgetting his cell phone.
I'll probably never date a celebrity again
He gives me more of what I need.
I'm sure it was just my imagination and yet I...
I’ll say it again, Loch Ness wasn’t all-inclusive
Been there. Done that.
He doesn’t need to manscape, Todd! He’s a Yeti!
With global warming pushing creatures out of their natural habitat finding Sasquatch just isn't as fun.
He said we went right past the turn for Hoboken.
Don’t worry.  He says we’re almost to the top.
He's worried about Climate Change.
I've got to  help him.
He said we made a wrong turn at the last ridge.
Apparently there's a little known Airbnb at the top. Though not much air.
He won't say
For the last time, I said big feat as in triumph!
Donnie says nobody loves him, everybody hates him, he's going to Russia to eat some worms.
So much for my job with the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.
I wish you had bigger feet.
He says he's not abominable and to please stop pestering him.
You're the one who suggested polyamory
I told you our mountain gear was all wrong
He's OK with it, but wants to be sure we know that the shanty ahead on the right is NOT an outhouse.
He is really committed himself to getting out more this year
Who you calling abominable?
He asked if we could turn down the thermostat.
He’s great in Sled
You can't use that word in this climate.
He had to go to the “little boys room”
Don't give up Yeti!
Never mind. It's only Bigfoot's brother.
I feel like you're judging me.
I told him no, so he’s going off to sulk.
He  said he forgot his sunglasses.
He said it would be $50 a day more if you can't keep up.
Hard to believe he’s related to Frosty.
He’s selling life insurance.
Yeah, he was my guide last year.
You brought me all this way for a stupid autograph?!
The only turning around I'm doing is back down the mountain.
Dad made and then lost a fortune with his anti-hair loss invention.
I could have sworn he said 'no pictures.'
Apparently, sometimes less really IS more.
Don't worry, it's not the Abominable Snowman. It's just Bigfoot.
Your friend really should not be climbing in this environment without the proper footwear.
Heh...we’re idiots. It was LEFT at the boulder, then RIGHT at the caveman remains.
Says he's fed up with mountain climbers
Your idea of a secluded vacation spot differs a bit from mine.
Grandma Fern was right; they do grow big in these hills.
Stop calling him that. Your farts are way worse.
well he’ll treat me better than you ever did!
I can't believe he made us carry all his luggage.
He says he finds your attitude as abominable as the weather.
I said, You don’t look abominable to me...
He says he’s the Abominable Snowthey.
He’s heading in the wrong direction if he’s looking for the nude beach."
Is that Trump or Bigfoot?
I guess he just wasn't in the mood ..?
It takes a couple days to adjust to the altitude.
Big Foot and I are heading to the summit. Join us if you are so  inclined.
That’s just the new Patagonia.
Should we get his autograph?
I hope you’re having fun, because I’ve found this hike to be nothing but abominable!
Told you the Metrosexual thing was passé!
Actually, despite his reputation, he's a very nice chap.
He suggests that we just go naked.
He asked me out, but I could never see myself being Mrs. Bigfoot.
Just follow the damn sherpa!
He says your breath smells abominable.
It's not you, it's me, and it's OMG HIM!
It's too cliche to be real.
He says he won't run for president.
It's over, Larry, Yet's the abominable snow man of my dreams!
You couldn’t find a better tour guide!
Actually, the myth is debunked: "Big foot, big...
He says a warm den with kitchen is just a few hundred feet further up!
Quick, do you have your selfie stick?
It’s not scary, it’s fun, Eric! You never know who your Uber Guide will be. Now c’mon!
After next weeks appointment to get a Brazilian Wax , he’ll be everything I want in a man .
He's my ex. I told him to get lost --- forever!
Of course he’s real and he’s definitely all there!
I tried to warn him, but he is convinced that all the fuss about Global Warming is nothing but more B-S from liberals.
I told him, "20 bucks, same as downtown."
Just wanted a little peak
So, I asked him, "What are you?!"
He said, "Ya wouldn't believe me if I told ya."
Shook his head and walked away.
It was probably nothing. Yet I think it was something.
His wife called him FuzzyWuzzy.
Of course I’m leaving with him — you think I’m cold!
He said we can follow him to the nearest Starbucks.
He apologized for forgetting his pants.
He said there's a great view just a little further up.
It's true. I'm having his baby.
That was an abominable thing to say.
With a belly like that, he must be the Abdominal Snowman.
He won’t get far without a backpack and proper boots!
He stomped on my big toe—aren’t you going to do something?
You’re not listening to me.
I guess that's why they call him Bigfoot.
He's just not interested in being on Facebook
It's the same bully swagger.  This is where Trump has been hiding since the indictments came down.
If you want to use the porta potty at the top you're going to have to overtake him.
He should be disqualified.
I told you my relatives were an odd bunch but you did not believe...
He suggested I grow fur and put on some weight if I want to hook up here.
No, I told him I’m currently in a committed relationship@
The only scary thing about him is what he charges for coffee up here.
He was disappointed that our cooler wasn't a Yeti.
He says the trail going up is pretty abominable.
I see your point but I still won't believe you until pigs fly.
He’s going home for his GPS.
I thought you said that was just a phase you went through in college?
I finally talked him into coming down with us, but then I stuck my bigfoot in it talking about Trump.  He just turned around and said, "forget about it".
Those are some big feet to fill.
It just wants your attention. Ignore it and it will go away. "
He's going to show us where he keeps the coolers.
Good news! He says it’s only a little farther till he’ll stop to eat.
I just thought of a great name for our new cooler company.
Wanted to know if we could stop by Costco and pick up a Yeti.
Get lost...I am going up with a real man!
Wow!  I can believe it! We have the same sunglasses!
Did you see that post about the Yeti?
Is it abdominal or abominable?
You’ve hurt his feeling.
We need to do more cardio.
When Bigfoot goes low, he goes high.
He said it's just more of the same up there--abominable.
He's not abominable at all.
What? Him? No, he's not abominable at all - he's a really nice guy.
You know I don’t believe in yetis. I told him to take a hike.
He asked us to take better care of things.
I can't believe what Trump said yesterday.
I'm leaving you Tim, it's your full body waxing..
I offered to climb the rest of the way, but he said we weren't yeti.
His hairy ass could still use some pants.
For the last time, Bigfoot is NOT real!!!
The travel agency said he's a new guide. I guess Bureau of Labor isn't lying about the low unemployment rate.
Let's find out what gym he goes to.
The Yeti is going up to meditate and wants to know if we can come back later.
I hope he is wearing layers.
Why don’t they sell that outfit at L.L.Bean?
Hey buddy, the line starts back here.
You couldn’t even offer the poor guy a granola bar?
Are we nearly there, yeti?
Just some attention seeking mammal.
It's the Indomitable Snowman.
He said to follow his footsteps
See Nancy, Little Hands will do anything to escape impeachment!
It's just some jackass in a costume.
Lend him some of your clothes so we can take a picture with him.
It's strange. He never wears a backpack.
It's 80% mental power and 20% giant steps
His personal hotspot password is ‘Size32EEE.’  Case sensitive.
You're not high, you're high up.
He's thousands and thousands of years older than you and you can't even keep up with him!
I said I would follow you anywhere, but there are limits!
HE WOULDN'T LET ME TAKE A SELFIE WITH HIM - HOW ABOMINABLE!
He's upset because I wouldn't lend him my sunglasses.
I'm sorry, but he's a very private person.  Have you tried ancestry.com?
Call it abominable, but I'm going up with him.
I'm pretty sure he's a sasquatch not a yeti.
He doesn't have stock options, job prospects, or even a working knowledge of the English language, Yeti never complains. It's over, Roger.
Just like a man! What I saw was abominable!
Yeah, he seems cool but never go with a Yeti to a second location.
Bet you can't fill his shoes!
He said to turn left at the next crag, and it's the second peak on the right.
Of course he's annoyed! Your dad jokes are abominable!
I think he said he was an Autobahn Showman
Let the Wookiee win!
You won't believe it.
Just Great! It is one thing to show off your new boots. It is another to let him know that they don't come in his size."
He said it's only 500' to the summit. He's clearly using his own scale
He said if we get enough altitude we'll see God next.
On the plus side, at this elevation, most people throw up.
He said he's setting up an exploratory committee to run for President.
He said he's moving into more rarefied air.
Did you remember to close the garage door before we left?
Just wait, he's going to get us some chai.
Yah, he’s waiting for the Amazon guy to bring his Yeti cooler.
He doesn't give autographs
he's a monkey's uncle.
Sorry, Gary, but I was looking for someone less abominable.
Well, he said we are the ones who are odious, and that it's time we get real about what a hot mess humans are.
He said if I took his picture he'd throw us off the mountain.
Do you think he is covered by The Endangered Species Act.
Where there is one Yeti, there are more Yeti.  I just haven't seen them Yeti.
I agree with her - it is the men that are always hiding.
He was out of toilet paper.
He looks like he knows his way around, let’s follow in his footsteps
I was disgusted, yet-I couldn’t help but stare.
Apparently he's "too big" for selfies.
That reminds me, I left my razor at home.
As our group’s next trip leader you are sure going to have big shoe’s to fill.
I told you that we should of brought our fur coats
We watched "King Kong" on my laptop.  He loves me, but not that much.
I didn't realize you asked your Father to join us hiking this weekend.
He’s upset about being called ‘abominable.’ Says ‘adorable’ is much more fitting. Please apologize.
I thought we discussed unfriending Big Foot.
Well, maybe he's just a guy in a fluffy snowsuit.
He said the rest of the way will be abominable
Regardless, I'm keeping my coat and shoes on.
Ok. take you stick and crampons and turn around, I'm following an evolved man.
Let 's  follow him and  maybe  he will show  where we can stay overnight
Just a friendly grunt "hello", nothing abominable at all.
It's not his big feet. It's his long legs that make him rise above myth.
He does keep an abominable pace!
Just another poor, lost, disenfranchised Republican!
It's either him or me.
I told you faux fur was back in this season.
You know, its not everyday that you get to meet your heroes.
No, he was really nice.  Not abominable at all.
No,you tell him the pants store is the other way.
He's real
Where did it get that great gear? I can't see any logo.
I can't walk behind him when he breaks wind.
Follow him if you're looking for the bathroom.
He said I shouldn't believe him.
He said he doesn't need a guide that  he knows the trail like the back of his BIG FOOT !
Relax! I told him I wasn't interested in propogating his genes.
I'm sooo sorry dear, I have to go You know...my foot fetish.
We could really relate with each other once I realized it was Ms. Susquach.
The funny thing is, this the 4th time I’ve seen him this week. Strange.
Oh Yeah?  He may be abominable to you, but he's my man.
It's not you, it's Sasquatch
You've got big shoes to fill. Go for it !
He says he can lead us to the best mocchacino in town!
He said we are welcome....but the restaurant is closed for the winter.
The context doesn't matter, 'abominable' is one of those words people just don't use any more.
The Sensitive Snowman, more like.
Are you the new chief of staff?
Oh, I wish I had my cellphone so I could record this now and watch it later.
Don't you think he strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy?
I knew I shouldn't shaved my legs.
I told him that Frosty wasn't real
At least he isn't afraid to keep going-- even if he is an abominable know it all man.
To quote the Bard, "I have thee not, and Yet I see thee still."
I told him to stop being such a snowflake.
Common Gary, you said you were prepared for this.
John, I'm leaving you for Lance...
He said if we stop calling him "abominable" he'd make us a nice frittata.
Yeah, sure... but a truly great candidate for 2020 - now THAT’S rare!
Now THAT’S an Instagram opportunity.
I told you we should have brought our phones.
Because HE'S there?
He doesn't look so abominable to me.
You want me to do what?
This shutdown has been pretty revealing, I would have never guessed he worked for the government!
Are you happy now Justin?
He said he forgot his parka at the top.
He believes a run for President might help him rebrand as “Big Hand.”
Cover your nose. His gas is also abominable.
I told him women at the top are tying to break a glass ceiling and he wants to watch.
He said don't go up there. It's too icy.
Nice enough, but so lonely.
Please, Tom, please don’t say 
“He saw me, but nobody will believe him”.
Nice try, but I'm still not ready to meet your parents."
The air is so thin up here, I am hallucinating!!
What! We're only distant cousins?
Apparently, everyone does have a walk away price.
Actually,I think he's kind of cool."
He said he does not need aftershave to please his wife!
The casting director for Finding Bigfoot is holding auditions up there.
No, I said we should look for an indominable snowman!
See?! I told you it was too soon to tell him that Santa Claus isn't real!
Another free solo attempt is my guess.
Well,  I'd say you were abominable to him!
He said take a left at the next light.
Apparently he and Bigfoot had a falling out. Won't come down until he apologizes.
See,I told you so! This local is taking us to his favorite hideout eating place!
I don't care what his name is, he definitely meant to step on my foot
He said he wants to be in a movie called 'The Shape of Snow'.
Guess what? I am leaving you.
I have eyes—I don’t need Google.
I thought us Homo Sapiens had climbed our way to the top
John! You know he's sensitive about his feet!
He said ever since they declared global warming a hoax, he's been suffering with an identity crisis and indomitable hairballs.
Give me that stick Medium Foot and I'll show you what Little Foot can do!
Is it Abominable or Deplorable?  Whatever.
Thank God we have a new definition of abominable.
He's a really good hiking guide
Did you have to tell him he looks like a hairy ape?
Did I just see Big Foot?"
"Johnny, I know my feet are big but do you have to point them out every five minutes!
Free-styler.
As if he's the Sasquatch from Ipanema.
Don't you think our guide has rather big feet?
She said she's having a self care day and doesn't feel like doing photos.
He said the Starbucks down on the left
Yet I want to keep going!
The Yeti says the Yentl is over the next mountain... and ask to try her Matzo Ball Soup.
I dunno who he is, but I'd sure like to know where he shops for fur.
Okay, Ted!  I'm sorry to break it to you like this...but it IS love at first sight!
Watch out. I think he's  gay.
What did you say?
They say it's better than Gore-Tex.
He says it’s actually Snowberg.
He complained about global warming and Trump's border wall.
He wanted to know if I was a life coach
You told me to follow my own spirit climber
Oh Yeah? Well I think it's abominable that you can't keep up...
You're SO abominable, Marco! I'LL asking him for directions.
He forgot his coffee.
He WAS helpful. We missed the turn down below.
He's really a nice guy once you get to know him.
These Sherpas are getting better and better.
What’s so upsetting about asking for a piggyback.
Your lack of perception is abominable.
This _definitely_ is dangerous.  And, no, it's not worth it to get more steps!
Sir, do you know what happened to the National Enquirer reporter?
Now I know where your behavior comes from.
He said that Paul is doing fine and we needn’t worry.
It’s not working out. He got pretty frosty when I said his outfit was abominable.
Yes we are lost, the map clearly says Yeti not Bigfoot
Okay, mister I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.  I got the directions.
See? He doesn't need a walking stick.
He just wanted the name of my esthetician.
Do you remember where we parked the car?
It was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
This blind date is going so well, I'm quite breathless.
Don't bother, he doesn't speak English.
Frank, I have some great news. He said he WON'T eat us AND he'll give us an exclusive interview back in his cave.
well mr. smart,if we're lost,ask him.
Sorry brother, he's just not that into you.
No hard feelings Chad; it's just you're a little too bombinable for me.
This trip isn't a total failure, he said he'll lead us to a flower found only in high altitudes.
He keeps farting!
It's hard to tell from the photographs.
You said we were looking for unicorns!
I did so see a Sasquatch!
You are abominable. You know he's self-conscious about his feet.
He forgot his Trail Mix.
He says the Yeti-licious Cafe at the summit is open until 2 if we intend to order.
We're on the verge of making the biggest scientific breakthrough known to mankind, and all you care about is whether or not I've been cheating on you with Charlene?
He said he only dates girls, no couples.
You never pay any attention to me!” “Now, Margaret? You’re going to do this now?
I felt the earth move!
They said, "The views are something you have to see to believe."
Sorry but I couldn't resist his animal ways.
How would you like to be called by your most pronounced feature? “Here comes a needle nose!”
He said he's sick and tired of all the current name-calling, and can't stand the term "abominable."
You heard what he said, go back to base camp.
I told you we were overdressed for this hike!
woah - did you see the size of his feet?!
He says we should have taken the South Col.
When I asked him to take a selfie with me, he said, 'Take a hike!'.
I told you we should have turned left at the pass
He's not just a Yeti...he's MY Yeti!
You may not want to follow him, Yet-i will.
He said the alien ship is the next peak over.
Why did you wait until him to ask for directions!
Do you believe me now? I told you that high altitudes sun exposure makes your body hair grow wild!!
I told you you didn't need to buy all that gear!
He said it's actually pronounced 'abdominal.'  And then he said the most abominable thing I've ever heard.
Check! Tooth fairy?
Damn! Now he gets to see the other side of the mountain!
I’ve seen him a few times but I’ve learned to let him go.
He offered me something you just can’t give me - a fur coat forever!
C'mon. He he said we'd be fine.
He's invited us to his ski lodge.
I asked for the WiFi code and he said, "and you call me abominable?"
You wouldn't know Big Foot if it hit you over the head.
He's checking to see if our mesa is ready.
I can't believe he just blew us off like that!
Larry you can be so insensitive sometimes, I told you his name is Bob, not Big Foot
No, Daddy, we're going to sign your stupid pre-nup.
Not impressed. His little thingy looked like a toadstool.
He won't take a selfie with you, but he is a real gentleman if you need a hand jumping a crevasse.
and you said he would be abominable!
I told you hiring a guide would be a mistake.
What do you mean rude? I would call his comments abominable.
See! I told you we shouldn't have shaved before coming!
He doesn't like the name 'yeti.' He says it makes it hard getting a hotel room.
John,it isn't working out.  I must follow my heart!  Besides, I have a thing for hairy backs.
Eddie & Betty repel a Yetti.
Yet, I...
He's not my type after all.
Maybe he's just a "minimalist."
Hey great to see you! It wasn't really working out with him, but we promised to stay friends.
He said the special of the day at Top of the Hill Diner is pot roasted elk and well worth the climb.
Not really that big -- I'd say about size 10.
He feels like a third wheel.
Some of these climbing parties are abominable.
He is looking for a restroom”
We should give him a better tip with our next hike.
He forgot his hair dryer.
Yeah, I noticed. He must be maxed out on Propecia.
I wonder where he got that coat?
Quick, snap a picture! Oh, the girls will love this.
Says he’s looking for the Himalayas.
He said he saw you with his wife?!
I told you we wouldn't need all this expensive equipment.
Honey, I want to be a gatherer.
I wear a size 10 shoe.  Why do you ask?
I’ll be joining my friend now in Shangri-La.
It’s been great!
You might want to turn back - the weather up there is abominable.
Honestly, I felt out of place at the top.
He says the view from the top is spectacular.
Absolutely nobody going to believe us back home... but at least that guy knows we hiked this high.
"Instead of bumbling along, we could follow his bigfoot steps."
I'll do big, and I'll do audacious, but I draw the line at Harry.
Don't worry, Bigfoot is just a myth.
I hate to see him go, but I love to watch him leave.
I told you my old boyfriend was cold.
He offered me a million dollars to sleep with you.
Yes, it's true what they way about big feet.
Just don't look him in the eye.
I bought these fun hiking glasses at REI which play motivational youtube videos to keep me climbing, but I worry I'll miss some of the scenery.
Harry may be hard to follow, Yeti doesn't complain nearly as much as you do.
He’s going to give me a free breast exam but he wants you to check his prostate
The conditions today are abominable
He claims that my recommendation as to pants was a "trigger."
Yup, genuine Yeti. 
The whole outfit's from the Yeti Boutique on Mercer Street in Soho.
I’ve decided to leave you for Gerhart.
Lost his GPS"
Don't strip down. You are no match for him or the weather.
This is turning out to be the most abominable vacation ever!
He says he's Harvey's twin brother.
I've heard that finding a Sasquatch is an up-hill battle.
Maybe we could ask him for directions?
You told me Mr. Right didn't exist, but you were wrong.
I have NO idea where he packed it, but he said we could use 
his selfie stick at the summit when he's done using it.
He used to love it when I teased him
Fancy meeting you here.
But he won Bigly . . .
I've never tried speed-dating before.
He wanted to know the 7 day forecast.
What an awkward conversation. No one can know about this.
It started to walk away after I said it's feet looked small to me.
She said until her family gets royalties on those coolers she won't allow photos.
Why did you leave the camera at base camp?
I"m bored.
Product placement is beyond ridiculous these days.
He said proceed at your own risk if you don't have big feet.
Those new Patagonia suits don't look so breathable, do they?
Look, i just met the guy! We're getting together for drinks later!
Personally, I think this menage a trois is a bit over the top.
Do people here have any sense of fashion?
It doesn't take much to see that the problems of two little people and one gigantopithecus don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.  Some day you'll understand that.
The Amazing Race: Mythical Creature Edition

"While the humans argue about the existence of God, Mr. Yeti powers toward the finish line."
You know I love you Bill, but it just feels like we are going in different directions
That was the hotel, the room's not ready yeti
We couldn't find common ground.
He's testing our new line of Winter Wear.
These official Birdbox blackout glasses are amazing!
I know a walking stick when I see one...and that was not a walking stick.
I agree, real fur will keep you much warmer than synthetics.
I asked him if his outerwear comes in extra small.
Unbelievable!  I can access trail maps on these smart glasses!
I thought you turned the oven off.
The nudist lodge on the summit has lowered its standards.
For  a moment, I thought I saw you climbing the mountain without your backpack!
Nahhh... It's not worth it. He voted Trump.
He said if we loose sight of him to follow his tracks.
He's our sherpa.
Actually, he seems pretty nice.
He said: “You could reach the top this way, Yeti think not.”
It's Gucci's chic new winter line
He is actually quite delightful!
Honey, he must be going to the "Mountaintop Swingers Party" that we read about in the brochure at the lodge! You in?
He’s done this a few times
He said his name is Dale.
What did I say, this time?
Not many people on this trail. Eh?
No, as a matter of fact, it was pretty abominable!
Trust me, turn around. It's an abomination up there.
He said hiking has been good for his heath.
I’m goin to sleep my way to the top
You should apologize, your comment about his feet hurt his feelings.
Ill bet he didn't consult any hiking catalogs on what to wear!
It's not you, it's me.
He said he wants to go by Big Calves next year
Come back later,  Big Foot is going up for a nap now.
Yeti / Yet he.  Kinda like that whole your / you're thing.
Based on Newton’s Third Law ..... I’m waiting here!
He says we don't need crampons.
He's leaving because he says unless I can assure him of all book and movie rights in writing, we'll never see him again.
Come on, it'll put hair on your chest.
We matched but had an abominable time
Blind Woman: What did you just call me!?-
Dang did you see that guys feet?
I still think i'ts fake!
Good news.  Jesus loves me.
See a guy around here? Big feet, lots of hair?
It appears they haven’t heard of manscaping in these parts.
This new guide said he will take us to the top for a banana
We have to keep looking. He changed his mind about letting the president stay here after Trump blocked him on Twitter.
He claims he invented a cooler
I told you before Todd, it's a terrible joke.
Go confront him!  He told me I had a great butt and then gave a nasty grunt.
I'm not sure. He couldn't speak any English.
I know that he doesn't exist, yet I saw him.
He got the most five-star ratings as a guide from the Hotel Yak & Yeti.
You know what they say about Big Foot
Honestly Josh, I've told you a thousand times, it's 'Plus-sized Foot
I already have over 200 likes on Facebook.
I want a divorce, Karen
He was offended that Siri said he was Abominable.
Are we there Yeti?

Caption by my wife, Maegan Hinton
-Scott McDavid
He says up there it’s the off-season. Next month the Bigfoot viewings will be at its peak.
The Bigfoot in the room
Sorry, no manage’ a trois
If he really wanted to eat us, he would’ve done it already.
Did you really have to make him mad?? Now how do we get out of here!
Dr. Livingston, I presume.
He has a relative that lives somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.
Jeez, another Abominable Congressman.
Let’s go back; I don’t want to be seen with him.
Hmmm...There's something amiss about this mountain guide.
This wasn't covered in the safety demonstration so things might get hairy..
He said he moved here for a low monthly rent, but the parking is just horrible.
He prefers loathsome.
Hey George is that the Loch Ness guy?
Just follow his footsteps- they are supposed to be quite big
I forgot my moisturizer.
Knock it off with the yellow snow jokes!
You wouldn't like it up there. It's abominable.
I just Love  a guy with a hairy back!
He does not want anymore visitors.
Quick, get out your Camcorder from 1996"
You're being evasive.
I asked if he'd like to join us, yet he just walked away.
That guy said, “Haven’t you ever seen a Sasquatch before?”
The altitude really got to him.
Shhhhh, he doesn’t like the term yeti
You said, 'not yet,"  so I say, 'it's Yeti.'"
One, Mississippi . . .
John, when did you start seeing things?
The nerve of him calling us 'tenderfoots'.
He says his name is Bernhard!
He'll do fine in the cold. He has polar fleas.
He says we have big feet.
My friend said there was a monster here, Yeti wasn't clear about it.
They say that global warming has reduced Al Gore's natural habitat to a handful of Himalayan mountains
They didn't tell us our guide was not into wearing pants.  I'll take off a star or two on yelp, I guess.
Can you believe that guy climbs without water?
He says to ignore our Sound of Music obsession.
Now look what you have done.  He’s disinvited us to his chalet.
He said he's a border wall tester.
I'm glad I didn't wear my fur suit too... that would have been embarrassing.

Wait up Angela!
Honey, I wasn't saying you had big feet...
He says your walking stick is "abominable."
Here come the hipsters.
He wants food, shelter and his own YouTube channel.
He can actually be very funny.
Maybe we should try barefoot, too.
Global warming.
This mountain guide is amazing.  And he doesn't take promotional gifts from hiking gear companies!
He’s not only the owner, he is a member too.
Don't they make underwear his size?
(Yeti speaking into bluetooth earpiece) “Omg, Joan- you will never guess what just happened..”
He's a Tunta, not a Yeti.  Their family hasn't been speaking to the Yetis for several years now.  He asks if we could bring more frozen peas the next time we visit.
He cannot resist an uphill challenge
You need to start taking bigger steps.
He says that if we can beat him to the top, he's willing to put on a pair of  pants.
Next time, we go with prescription sunglasses.
No, this doesn’t warrant you using a selfie stick.
He said, "Been there, done that!"
He wants us to respect his privacy
I told him the climb was abominable, but he didn't seem to mind.
He’s going to make waffles.
It’s over, I found someone new and you’ll never see me again
He said, "I'll see you at the top."
Yes Peter, he must’ve used Mapquest.
No, I asked- it's not Stevie Nicks
Are you SURE you locked the front door?
I told him you're a big fan he doesn't care.
My god he was good!
Honest, Tom, he reassured me that he and I still have an open marriage.
No! I'm not going to ask him what shampoo he uses.
None of your “cold-blooded killer” speech now...let’s just see where he takes us.
He kept yelling: "I was in the pool!"
Actually, his feet are not really that big.
You’re giving up?! Oh, you’re just mad about Hairy!
I think he said to call him Kevin, do you think he is in hiding?
I told  you harry was a “beast” on the mountains.
It can't be Sasquatch if there are no footprints, right?
I told you not to bring your sister.
So what will you do with the newfound knowledge on how not to leave footprints in the snow?
Bigfoot my ass!
Apparently those Messin' with Sasquatch commercials are a trigger for him.
He says he has a mate. They're blue because of the cold.
He walks to the beat of a different drummer
He simply asked that we not pick the snow lillies.
Billy! I thought we were going to see the Abominable Snowman, not Bigfoot.
Remember what Littlefinger said: Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
I swiped right for manscaping
I thought this hike was going to be hairy but not for that reason!
He's my mentor. I've decided to become the first female yeti.
You think he'll take a selfie with us?
Well, you heard him Mark, all must follow the strict dress code of the mountain.
I told you...perfect teeth!
John, our Uber guide is right, you do have tiny feet--ha ha.
that solves that. Yeti happens.
I'm going with him. Get off our mountain!
You'll get there faster if you stay in his draft.
You also look abominable with those silly Foster Grants."
I told you we’re on a de-evolution path.
He could at least get his back waxed!
We walk, we talk! Am I missing something?
His next press conference will be in the summer.
Well, if there was a' Big Foot' around here, I would know it!
Hmm.. I don't know about "Big Foot", he looks like a size 9 to me.
He says most don’t make it back down alive, but something tells me it’s not from the treacherous weather conditions.
The Sasquatch returns to his lair, body shamed once again
I thought that was Donald, but I guess not
Do not worry! I told you I do not like harry men!
I'm leaving you, Chad. I've found a man who can better help me achieve my goal.
Guess he’s piqued.
Bigfoot says he has had enough of Donald Trump wreaking havoc and chaos in the world.  He is going to find some place safer."
He didn't say much, he seemed rather frosty.
Did you see that? He spit on me! Go punch him!
I wonder where he got his coat.
The view up here is absolutely unbelievable!
Climb no farther, the weather & people are abominable!
They are giving out Paleo snack samples at the top. Hurry before they are gone.
Maybe he's just a vegan.
He didn't believe me.
He insists he's a viable candidate, but he starts with an uphill climb.
Ever feel like you're being Sasquatched?
He says, "Down in the valleys, THAT'S where it's abominable."
What was I to say?  He was mumbling “Age before beauty”?
He wants to be the first to make an ascent in a onesie."
How Abominable! Yet, I cannot fathom why we keep bumping into each other like this.
He screamed “TOURISTS KEEP RIGHT!”
He's invited me to go with him. I'll see ya.
You didn’t have to tease him about following a path to spiritual enlightenment.
You'll notice your body will adapt to the thinner air that's about to start.
Don't mind him. The locals really hate tourists.
Go ask him for a selfie! #Hesreal
He said, "Just keep going down the hill until we see the ski lodge."
Now you’re just being abominable!
Who are you calling a 'yenta'?
No, there is a definite scent of musk, but I didn't see any footprints.
Nothing worth posting up that way.
He said that it's just abominable up there.
Hurry Up!!  That fat guy passed us 3 times already on the way up.
He forgot his crampons.
I can't believe we've been where no man has been before.
I don't think he would forget our anniversary, Larry!
He said we are heading toward the wrong peak.
He says he's it's true: he's a size 34 and insists on getting a pair he can show us.
He made the earth move.
And then he said to expose in the cold was natural!
I think we should wait and get him on the way down.
Real subtle; Asking for directions to the nearest dentist
This is why you should always carry a razor while hiking.
He's a  nice enough guy but needs to brush his teeth more often.
Apparently these new lenses filter out UV and glare but not cryptids.
Nice to meet you Jack. I’m Jill. Wanna fetch a pale old Yeti?
Did someone just walk by us? No clue, I can't see anything doing this Birdbox challenge.
Did you have to go with the least expence guide?
Damn, that reminds me, did you drain the cooler?
Have we met before?
Not only is not Charlie, but we're on the wrong damn mountain
You won't believe this, but that dude said he's headed to the summit to spot UFOs.
He said "follow me.  Mi Casa es Su Casa".
I couldn’t imagine it either, yet he really loves me
Honey, I’m still uncomfortable when you bring up your Ex.
I do not find him abominable!
What a jerk! Too busy to say hi?!!!
He said he's with you.
He said go back down a half a mile and turn left, mountain beasts are so helpful.
He says he lives over the hill.  After that it's all downhill.
He wants syndication options too.
You'll have to wait until Big Foot is finished talking to the Swami
You’re LATE, man. Not EARLY!
He says their closed for the winter.
He impregnated me while you were dawdling. I have to go with him now.
I told you we had way too much stuff
Bro, when you reach the summit, you're only half way there.
It's Ladies' Night at basecamp.
If that's Sasquatch, there must be leafy greens up there.
It didn't work out between us.  I'm into Brazilian style.
You were really abominable! He says he knows the way.
I told him to f**k off.
Do you know what the WiFi password is?
I hear he doesn't give autographs.
You don't hear a word I'm saying, yet i keep talking... am I the crazy one here?
He said to follow him to the land of expensive coolers and mugs
He said thanks but he really wanted a pizza.
There is a very strict dress code.
He forgot his hat
He's on You Tube now so he is real.
I want his outfit
Watch what you say. He turned downright antisocial when I mentioned how big his feet are.
How many times did I remind you to pack the beef jerky?
I told you we should have gone to your mother's, Rupert.
Where's Dad?
No, I saw him first!
You guys want anything from the fridge?
If you don't want to follow him, I will. I like his style.
…and yet I love the Yeti! When you go low we'll go high!
He's Just One of the Locals
From up here, we can see everything!
Don't worry he says he wants to serve man.
I had just passed a couple who'd been caught off guard mid-argument by a windchill in 1998 when I realized: I don't hate people. I just feel better when they aren't around.
Not at all Abominable
Now I call his lawyer and get $130,000.
He said he forgot to take a selfie.
They're unfriendly during interval training.
Unfortunately they weren't interested in hearing about the Church of Yeti
He had me at 'Abominable.'
Sorry, but his nest egg is bigger than yours, literally.
I figured he'd be wearing fleece.
I told you we should have gone to Boca Raton for this vacation!
I said HI, and didn’t look !
You’re too slow. I’m going to the summit with him.
Damn, what a time to have forgotten our cell phones.
This climb is abominable
He says he hasn't seen your missing cufflink.
What’s the password?
You're walking a slippery slope breaking up with me to go with him.
You suggested I set the search distance on that casual dating app so low. Now, do you want to try a three-way or not?
He was undeterred when I warned him that the weather at the top is abominable.
Let's follow...he must know the best nearby diner
I knew Stanley would forget something
Well, he warned us about wearing proper gear...
Yeh, I asked. He said it is warm, mumbled something about Amazon, and kept going.
I never expected to see a Brazilian wax up here.
He's Abominable!"
His climbing techniques are abominable.
I'm done with you, Dan.
I said, it wasn't me!
He came down to look for a reasonable barber shop.
Being abominable just ain't what it used to be.
He says he doesn't believe in getting acclimatized.
We're lost and all you do is scream and grunt?
He said there's a nice mountain lodge about a quarter mile up this trail.
He thinks he's Sisyphus.
He has abominable manners.
Age before beauty, Jack.
He says we should itemize this year...
Now let's go back home.
Wow, best sex I've ever had!
Foot" envy, Clark
He just wanted to google map the nearest pass.
I told him I didn't believe in the abominable snow man"
They’ll never believe us!
I get "embracing your wild side" but that guy is taking it to a new extreme
He's Doing It, So Why Can't You?
I didn't see anything, did you?
He said the yetis are on winter break.
I don't know why they call him 'Bigfoot.' He can't be bigger than a size 12.
do you think this counts as cultural appropriation?
For the last time, stop calling your mother-in-law names.
Another dud. Way too much camera awareness and he wouldn’t sign a non-compete. Let’s just go with The Rock in a suit.
Well, if he had ASKED, I would have told him"
I called him "Mythter" and I think it upset him.
Does that mountain inthe background remind you of toblerone too?
I can't figure out if he was more abominable than you are...
I don't know why you can't ever ask for directions? We missed the turn off for Club Med 3 miles back.
You didn’t make reservations!
He is in! The multi-platform launch of the “Yeti Diet” is next month. He can hit the talk show circuit in the summer but no late night and no press during hibernation.
I've got the name for our brand.
He said he will be ok.
Where’s his long black overcoat and long red tie?
My only New Year’s resolution is to be more present.
Don't even think of keeping up.  He just saw "Free Solo".
He said the nearest shelter is abominable.
You mean I bought all this outdoorsy crap for nothing?
Why did you bring us on another fruitless Sasquatch search??????
He's got some pair. Uh, I mean he only wants me to follow."
He said the rest of the trail is abominable
As if it weren't bad enough we doubted his existence, wait till he realizes he left his rock at the bottom.
Yes, but I get the dog.
He said, "It's REALLY cold up there!"
Paleo diet clinic next valley over."

Marja Mills, Chicag
I'm sorry John, he just gets me. I guess deep down I always knew I was a Sasquatch.
The Yeti museum is closed
You won't believe what I'm looking at.
He said, “Sorry, invitation only.”
He says for some fine dining...follow him
He says the Khumbu Icefall is too dangerous today.
My old boyfriend took me to Cabo.
So do you come here often?
He said there's no trespassing!
Yada, Yada, Yeti.
This Sherpa comes highly reeomended
Me too.
We're invited to a wall-painting party at 7...with the usual wooly mammoth BBQ.  Wanna go?
He’s not fooling anyone in that getup.
He said he is not abominable.
You just HAD to go and tell him he's ugly, didn't you?
I guess this is what he meant by “turn left at Yeti Crossing.”
Just cause he looks like my father doesn't mean I want to be with him.
Jeez — His behavior is absolutely abominable.
That yeti said  he's moving to higher ground because of global warming.  I told him to email the White House.  Maybe trump will believe HIM.
What?
The Bigfoot erotica made me think he'd be interested.
Trevor, that reminds me, we have to make it back to the city by six.  I’ve got my manscaping appointment
Well, aren't you the one with abominable manners?
See what you've done.  You are abominable.
No, Larry, of course I'm not really here; you're hallucinating.  Where's your oxygen tank?  And who brought you up here?
There is a lot of substantial foot traffic around here.
He says it’s only 1/2 mile to the next rest stop.
He’s my outdoorsy, mystery man!”
He says we'll get to see the Yetis in about an hour.
Looks like we found a new sherpa.
Holy heck, did you see that?!  That comparison about the size of a guy's foot must be true!
He's just a big friend.
Is yet another Yeti a cacophony?
Very hair-suit don’t you think?
He said he doesn't have a wi-fi code.
He said something about needing to get to the pharmacy to pick up his Rogaine.
He has an appointment with a podiatrist.
He’s hurt because I told him to go for a hike.
What form he has, right?
This is just what you have to deal with to have beach front property in 2030.
They told me that climbing Mt. Everest would be scary. I wasn’t expecting this!
You still believe we should go to the pinnacle?
Did you catch the label?
He says he's going to go order some outerwear on Amazon.
So some people have a high abominable factor, so what?
You're always talking over me!
He's embraced the barefoot hiking movement.
I thought follow the leader was your idea
I asked him, “Does da Crosstown Bus go by dis way ?” , and he said, “Do-dah, Do-dah!”
''Normal people scare him."
The stock offering was over two months ago!  He’s boycotting all selfies until he receives his Yeti shares.
He IS a scientist and he KNOWS that humans are causing global climate change.
He says if we follow him, he's got a whole photo studio in his man cave.
He said  damit Julie, next time YOU climb every mountain.
That's Donald-The World's Greatest Snowman!!!
I don’t care what he says, it will take more than a fur coat to reach the summit.
He asked if I dated abominable creatures that don't exist.
Get lost--you're not my type.
I don’t k know how he does it. He never gets tired. He’s a beast.
He says, "Go back where you came from, 
there's no place for you here".
That angry howl we heard earlier was from the abominable snowman's even more abominable snowwife.
Hey... was that John Goodman?
Did you have to put your big foot in it and tell him he wasn't the one on the dollar coin?
If you don't ask for directions...
It's been an uphill battle for recognition.
Sometimes I feel we are regressing as a race.
Tom, I told you that hiring Bigfoot as our sherpa was a bad idea!
You see what is ahead of us. Let’s turn back
He's gone retro.
It's planet-warming/ He has to go higher to be comfortable in the cooler temperatures.
Wow, his cardio must be really good!
If only his resolution was to get in shape and shave.
He was just checking on us. Turns out he's a yeti yenta.
He doesn't leave the seat up, He understands me and I know he did vote for Trump.
They did promise it wouldn’t be a walk in the park.
Why settle for ordinary when I can have someone bigger and better?
I told you I should have worn my fur coat.
It wasn't me this time - I swear.
I said bring the Yeti cooler!
One of the first Hair Club volunteers.
He said to follow him 'NO MATTER WHAT!
oh sure, now he walks upright.
Free Solo
I'm done with doing your laundry and ironing your shirts. Goodbye.
Listen -- it's more than just the cold shoulder, okay?
He says it's just five more leaps.
He's heading for the men's room. The lady's room is at base camp.
He pointed to my sunglasses and said something about climate change
He asked me " Do You Know the Way to San Jose?'
Harry just confirmed that your haircut is atrocious.
He said it's only a half mile to the summit.
Don't you just hate creatures who won't say 'good morning'!
I'm not so sure I still want to go to his home for dinner.
You're right, that wasn't Joni Mitchell.
Are you snow blind too?
Your friend certainly was stand-offish.
He said he just needs to get away once in awhile..
You and your sarcasm.
Can you see what I didn't just see?
I bet he's a denier?
We just broke up...he’s to old for me.
He said he wanted to play hide and seek, but I said no because I figured we'd never be able to find him.
If you lose your way just look down, the tracks are pretty easy to follow.
All my worries are behind me up here!
I told you my dad is very sensitive about that photograph!
Where'd you get that sherpa? Doesn't even lift a bag.
They do Brazilians, everything.
Do I detect a bit of bits envy?
He asked politely if we'd leave, that he's relaxing on holiday and doesn't like to be scared while he's here.  Let's follow him!
He said if all goes well, the prototype will be available at REI in time for the holidays next year.
Should we tell him how long a walk it is?"
I told you we should go au naturel!
'Free Solo' motivated them to go above treeline this season.
He's not at all happy about our choice of sandwiches this time.
He may be abomnable, but oh,what a kisser.
I thought I told you NOT to invite the boys.
He said the way forward was Abominable!
He says your GPS doesn't work here.
Let’s go ask him to be our Sherpa.
Stand aside, I'm Don Jr. and my daddy said I could kill that Yeti!"
See...He is leaving us because of your abominable remark!
Forest for the trees?  There are no trees.
He must be cold in his birthday suit!
We're next, unless we leave now.
Sorry for the surprise breakup honey but hairy hunk's bun is in my oven and we're late for a big foot gathering.
Ugh neighbors...
Yeti you beti!
He said there are more scenic views just over the hill
Apparently, his name is WARP...and he can write.
He says he's running away from this crazy world.
There is nothing to see up there that you cannot see from down here.
I think he said something about "forgetting ketchup".
How can you think following the instructor is better than following this guy??!
I told him, 'OMG, the Abominable Snowman's a myth.'
The only contacts he wants is by texting.
This guide, you hired. Does she know where she is going?
No wonder nobody can find this guy.
It's easy, just follow is footsteps.
Hmmm.  Maybe naked is easier.
It's over between us Todd, go back down.  His tantric technique is the stuff of my deepest fantasies, I can't even blink.
The nudist movement is really gaining traction
And we worried about OUR outfits..."
We've been climbing this abominable hill forever. Aren't we there yeti?
I told him that we could still be friends but he wasn't buying it.
Weird dude.
he's overrated.
No, I didn't take his picture. He said he wasn't interested in followers.
Did you bring any sunblock?
OF COURSE HE IS GOING FASTER THAN US LOOK HOW BIG HIS FEET ARE !
He's got to go back to camp, he forgot his cooler.
Don't worry, our Sherpa is a legend. And, with those big feet he'll clear a great trail for us to follow!
He's self-concious about his body.
C'mon! Free hair care products for anyone who summits.
He forgot his SPF 30.
Yeh. Same exchange whenever we part: I say, 'See you later,' and he replies, 'Better to see than be seen.' Really nice guy, though. Not as he is portrayed in the Fake News.
Snowblind? You're hallucinating!
That is why I come here to this exquisite place of natural beauty to awaken my senses to all that is around me!
When Harry left Sally
I just gotta believe better directions do exist.
I'll deny it, so will I.
1.	Nepali government should consider building a Wall!
Yes, I saw it! Don’t you dare say it!  Your puns make a piece of me die inside
You know he’s sensitive, Mario... yeti there you go again putting your big foot in it by saying he looks like Donald Trump.
'Says his name’s Gorp and, frankly, he sounds a little paranoid.'
I didn’t mean to offend him but I thought he was a Millenial.
I love you and that's why I have to leave you.
You bet he has a trek pole!
He’s leaving without even taking a selfie with us – he is truly abominable!
Paranthropus? What Paranthropus?
Well, that proves it. They do smell sickly-sweet.
I've heard he makes killer snow cones
Nice guy, boring personality though...
'Let's take a selfie.'
He's an abominable hiker.
Big feet, long toes.
He said he'll get the hostel open by the time we reach it.
You go back home, he and I are gonna spend time cleaning his cave.
Leave it to you to ask him where to find a good 'IPA 'and pizza around here!
Calling him 'abominable' hurt his feelings.
He said given our size he suggests the ridge to the right for the summit.
Would you quit ordering me around?
why didn't you tell me he was a vegan!
We've walked back too far
How rude! He’s sensitive about his shoe size.
Trust me; his feet aren't what's relevant to me for bigness.
I left him because of his hideous hairpiece.
He says not to bother.
Her: darling,wouldn’t it...
Him: Did you just see that that?!?
Her: See what? I’m trying to talk to you?!?!
He forgot his muffler.
Not impressed. Maybe 18 Wide.
He says he lost his pedometer
He says “No Humans Allowed!”
He is a fast climber, yet he has no hiking boots. Nor any clothes ---abominable!
Where can I get a parka like that?
I'd say about a size 30.
That was Donald Trump. All he said was, "See? Global warming is a myth!"
He's still holding out for a sponsorship deal with Yeti.
He'll never make it to the top.
His outfit is abominable.
If you follow her, I swear I'm going to my mother's mountain!
Saying Good Bye is the hardest part.
WOW- I just saw TWO abominable humans!
Here’s a man you can trust to know his way
Honey, that's not the Yeti I had on my Christmas list.
I am not coming home. His sense of 
adventure is better than just watching the travel channel.
So how are your Exposure Therapy sessions working out?
That’s not fair; he has longer legs than we do.
I told him about you so he's filing for divorce.
The only thing abominable is YOU! I'm going on with HIM.
Go figure. He wanted a sip from my Yeti.
Uhh I like ive has enough of the brownies, Jane.
Bigfoot? That's my cousin, dude
I told you to bring your good camera! You never listen to me. Remember when we went to my aunts house and I told you not to turn the light off in the staircase and when..... came to...... and  you thought ... even though I told you to you it woul....
Family isn't everything.
I told you not to laugh about his big, hairy feet.
I think I know why they call him Sasquatch!!
I told you he wasn’t interested in Little Foot.
I found him to be very anti-social.
He said to follow him to his cave and we can have tea.
Any further would be abominable.
He wants to know: Who won the 2016 election?!
You know, you should have a leash on your pet.
He'll never make it in that outfit.
Claims he’s looking for the people who stole his idea for thermos type camping gear.
He said the hard part of the trip is over and we should follow him for the quickest way to the top.
I told you we didn't need these ironic $5,000 Brooklyn Flea boots to get up there
What happens when the evolutionary chart tilts uphill?
I guess Teddy Bare there doesn't do cuddles...
I think he heard you talking smack about his prefrontal lobe. We'll never catch him now.
Big-Foot isn't even real- are you hallucinating again?
He asked which way was up.
Don't ask him for a selfie!
You're sure we're  going in the right direction?"
"Yes, I'm following Yeti man!
This year's REI catalog is a bit too daring for my taste.
This was an abominable idea!
I didn't know Uncle Harry was making the hike.
He muttered something about needing photo ID.
Should we ask him for a photo?
I sorry Allen, but I love Snow Joe and I’m going to folllow him to the Top Of The World...
Big foot?! Are you saying I have big feet?
I don't think Mother would approve.
We forgot to bring our ugly sweaters.
Hey, he invited us to his place for lunch!
He says to follow him, and meet Mrs Yeti
Let him take the lead, even if he may be an abominable know it all man.
Somehow he thought 'abominable' was a compliment, poor guy.
What do you mean? “Shit rolls downhill?”
Whaddaya mean I've got big feet!?
I guess time really does feel different on vacation.
It’s abominable how everyone is trying to climb Mount Everest these days.
I don't believe in anyone who hikes without proper boots or cool sunglasses.
Don't be so jealous, Jeffrey!  There's nothing going on between us!
I wish I had dressed as warmly as he did.
You kept doubting him Yeti did get us up here
Yes, I know, I told him yesterday he needs some sunglasses.
Don't meet your heroes - his foot size is average at best.
Don't make eye contact.
Technically he is still an illegal alien, but he voted for Trump
I hear that if you step in his footsteps, the avalanche won't kill you.
He only has 3 minutes to catch his Uber rendezvous.
They promised our Sherpa wasn't going to be Greek.
OMG! GMOs are more hazardous than we thought!
Oh, he doesn't look too abominable!
No not a Big foot sighting. But I do believe we've discovered Big Butt.
He gave me his autograph but wouldn't do a selfie with me
Trump couldn't get his southern border wall so he opted for Bigfoot on the northern border instead.
Don't look! Bird Box!
I'm glad I have a good razor.
I learned from him how to climb this mountain 
without a hiking stick.
Take care of yourself, Bud. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with the Snowman.
I think his name is Eddie.
What a nerve! He winked at me!
When global warming began, he rented out the house next to us near the Everest summit.
He forgot to pack his razor.
So Margaret is really all in on this Januhairy thing huh?
I told you Robin Williams was still alive in the Alps.
Did you remember to pack a razor?
No pictures, worst comb-over ever.
Do you think he'd carry out backpacks for us?
He said he needed to go home -- he was feeling abominably.
These clothes are weighing us down.
Did you See that guy!? He was wearing a figleaf!
Do you have to bring your opinions everywhere you go?!
See John, I told you the locals were tall around here.
Hiking helps him to slim down and become 'The Abdominal Snowman'.
He just passed gas, you follow him!
You never know who you're going to meet up here.
If we just stand here and argue, destiny may just pass us by.
He said he was sorry but that “He won’t take no group selfie without a selfie stick”.
He wants to be the first to complete an unsupported solo climb
These sunglasses aren't polarized, Bill!
He asked if I was available Friday night for a cocktail
You say one more thing about my feet and I'm heading back.
You said the hotel was ten minutes from the city centre!
He said  that if we want to climb this mountain, we need to call ahead  for reservations.
He says if we strip down to our skivvies we can follow in his footsteps.
Yeti Schmeti. This vacation is abominable.
It's quits for real!  His behavior was abominable, too!
Back and forth he goes, demolishing walls to let his family in!
All I said was your breaths abominable!
Sorry, Dan. He was pretty insulted as a vegan that you keep offering him jerky. He says I have to choose—him or you. At least he can get me off this mountain.
Yes, since they translated "Into Thin Air" into Yeti, absolutley everyone is trying it.
He's not just the president, he's a member…
Homefield advantage
I don't know what it was, but it has a big Google footprint.
There goes2018
No, you're abominable with that needle stick and those little feet!
He said he is late for the family dinner.
Let’s just go to his cave for a little bit. I’m sure he doesn’t have company often and I hear he makes great snow cones.
He feels strongly that he should get royalties for the damn cup.
He says we are trespassing on his property!
See, that guy doesn't need any high-tech climbing gear.
I wouldn't follow him if I were you.
If we follow him, do you think he'll take us home with him? Won't everyone be jealous?
He was the proverbial 98-pound weakling before he took up climbing.
He says that we're not at the top yeti.
You would think for a Yeti, he would be able to point us towards the elusive Sasquatch.
I walked right by them. There were two, they didn't even see me.
Trust me, it's like the new Brooklyn.
Coffee is okay, yet tea is my favorite
Selfie stick, are you kidding?
He says he's fleeing China.
"He's looking for some sunscreen and a pair of dry boots."
He forgot his backpack!
Goodbye, John.......I'm going with him.
Impressive feat.
He was hoping that we were carrying insulated mugs.
I really wanted an abominable selfie!
He claims he gets a 20 second head start.
That rug front of the fire?
I offered, but he said I wasn't his type.
What in The Wide, Wide World of Julie Andrews brings you here today?
I would suggest the restroom at base camp
He says the only way to go is up.
What do you make of us not leaving footprints in the snow?
While you besmirch my new man, HE has no problem buying me lady products.
Hiking in Colorado has really changed since Trump made it his summer getaway White House.
He may be a snowman, but in another 1,000 feer, he'll need oxygen like everyone else.
And then I said I was too young to go out with him.
George said if he's going to pull this off, he'll need more money.
How could you forget your iPhone Brad.
Oh, you think anyone who's not into cryptozoology is an academic butt-kisser.
He said that Global Warming is fake.
Withi this guy for a neighbor, it  practically guarantees you wife will never call you a Neanderthal!
No sunglasses? Sunglasses! Amazon is amazing.
He is not a public figure!  Leave him alone!
I didn't know your brother was coming along?
You’re asking me to put my life in the hands of a man who has not fully evolved.
Way retro!
I'm attracted to him.
I can see it's not occupied. I'm gonna give it a couple minutes.
Don't look behind you, but I think I see the Yeti.
He'll be back in a minute; he forgot to post on Instagram.
Wow! What a warm fuzzy!
Let's follow him
I guess 'The Abominable Stinker' would turn off the tourists.
Abominable!?  He seems quite pleasant and he's a Sherpa to boot.
We just broke up.
I think he's still in the process of becoming human.
She doesn’t like man
He said the hot springs are just a little further.
I'm guessing his diet is gluten free.
...I bet he plays for the Celtics!
I thought that your question was abominable, yet I can understand why you asked him.
You never bring up politics on a first date Jon! Everyone knows that...
Don't look at me that way!  He got fresh with me!
Nah, not the Abominable one, just an exhausted St. Nick.
So when we defund national parks you don't need a pass?
I thought you said you couldn’t secure a guide
You're calling me self involved?... Really, Gavin?
Whatta jerk — he said dressing in layers is overrated.
This is not what I meant by off-piste.
He is an alternate real.
I believe the phrase is ‘laugh it up fuzzball’. That and ‘why are there no footprints’?
That's what happens when your tent comes with free wi-fi and Netflix.
Behold- the furry butt strut.
I think his grunts indicated the path is this way
New year, same me.
Always judgmental!  I think you are abominable.
Now you've done it again. I told you not to question his sense of style.
I do NOT have big feet!
I don’t think he’s with the Backroads group
The nerve of that guy! He grabbed my phone when I tried to take a picture of him! Abominable doesn't even come close!
He just said if I want to see him naked I should Google his site.
I thought fur was a faux pas again but it’s suiting him quite well
He says climate change is getting pretty abominable!
Totally, it’s not him.
His back-hair makes him more manly than you.
Personally, I think he doesn't have enough layers to go up there.
What an abominable time to get snow blindness.
Have you seen my father? He left his shaving cream at home.
Is that your dad?
He's looking for a place that serves hot chocolate.
Davos parties are known for being funky.
They don't make snowshoes in his size.
I explicitly said not to tell him about Twitter!
Sorry, John. It is over between us. Do I love that hairy brute? Yes. Yet I ... know not why!
Ugh, are we there yeti?
If he can make it to the top, I think we can too."
Are you going to let him get away with _that_?
Okay, so he's already reached the peak in his career--but if you want to lead instead, you've got big shoes to fill!
Big Foot or Extra  Large ?
Well, I guess he didn't see me.
The hairspray was a deal breaker.
He says he doesn’t know the way down.
He saw his reflection in the snow-covered hill. Guess that means it’s safe to climb!
It's not that hard, if you already live there.
He said he’d give Santa our regards.
Apparently snow blindness is just another figment of the imagination?
He doesn't need a walking stick.
GPS is down, can't find trail, OMG what do we do?
I knew we got the wrong style snowsuit for this mountain.
Follow him he's evolving to a higher place.
So he said, “Just follow me,” but I’m a little nervous he’ll disappear and we’ll never see him again.
No, you tell him they’re out of towels
he's a good roommate but i wish he'd buy his own shampoo and conditioner
Just how DOES he do that without shoes?
He is searching for global warming.
You may follow the Neanderthal. I'm returning to civilization.
He says he's not some plaything and that if we're serious about fooling around, we have to sign a contract and enter his polycule.
It’s not really an ascent.
No wonder we’re lost! He said we should have taken the left at the last trail marker.
I think things are better where he's going.
He's just a guy in a furry suit.
I knew it!  He thinks same-sex marriage is abominable.
I swear, it was just an abomidable cup of coffee.
He was saying that Everest was right here
Really!? That's a new low for you Jack.
OK, sure but, can it tie a butterfly knot?"
It is after 5pm, he will be abominable again tomorrow.
His feet's not that big
"Oh, he's just checking out the hairy spots."
Oh he just needed to borrow a trowel.
So...Can you see yourself wearing it tomorrow?
Uh - Are you kidding me, Greg? Whatever-that-was just pushed  me over! I told you to stop him, yeti's walking away...
No squatch here man.
He told me he doesn't wear boots because his feet are too big.
Sure its a hike for laser hair removal, but Mom swears by it!
Let's go back. The top looks kind of scary from here.
He's angry because the weather today is sunny and not abominable.
Don't even try getting a word out of that guy-- his manners are abdominal.
Did you see that? So abominable, he just invaded my space. 
Aren't  you going to say something!
My turn. We already have Ascent of Man.
He says your perfect snow outfit makes him sick.
He got mad when I told him he needed a shave.
Do you not understand the word ‘abominable’ ?
Fool me once....!
I just became a highly paid scout for the N.F.L.
Well, he wasn't very abominal at all.
See? The camera does add 10 pounds."
Zgjim Terziqi, Kosovo
After his recovery from cocaine addiction, Leo really hates being called Abominable Snowman.
I'm tired of having this conversation over and over again. If you want to run for acting attorney general, then run.
Lunch? Not Yeti.
Haven't you heard of "pix or it didn't happen"?
He's hurt, says he's acrually quite bominable.
Try not to panic but I think there's a body buried over there"
Honey did you consider that he might get hungry and eat us after we smoke that blunt?
But I told your family that we were going to Miami.
Don’t wait up, he invited me to a cosplay wedding.
It's just a cooler, Frank. I want the real thing.
He wants us to follow him.
You follow him if you think foot size is a measure of spatial awareness.
I think it's time to descend: I just saw a guy in a funny white bearskin costume, and it's way past Halloween.
He wants to know if we're interested in buying shares of Yeti Spaghetti
Where is my camera?
You should have offered him a bigger tip!!
Perhaps we wait until he makes it to the summit!
Who knew that gaining perspective would actually increase my solipsism?
Said he left his car keys in his other suit.
Don’t look now but Bigfoot is behind you.
Do you think he might know where the closest loo is?
Who cares - as long as he can take an instaworthy picture for us
I told him it's over.  Let's go back to our little home, dear.
No, we're not going to push him off and see if he bounces.
Why is he running away from us?"
"I told him earth is flat"
Where’s a can of red paint when you need one?
Must be one of those "hipsters"  the folklore talks about
I think he's mad at us
He’s not going our way.
He doesn't know where Kylie did her Instagram shoot either.
This is a perfect spot for selfies!
Should we warn him about how the world has turned out to be?
No help coming back, He is staying in the White House
He changed his mind. No pickles.
It ate my friend.
Should we invite him back to the lodge for some eggnog?
Mike’s going to get there hours before we do with all this arguing!
Himalayan? No! He said I wasn't his type.
To me, the lede is its formation of a 2020 presidential exploratory committee.
Let's ask HIM who did the best acting in that "Twilight Zone" episode; Shatner or Lithgow
I told you so--Airbnb's can be abominable.
Eat your heart out!
I'm sorry, but I'm going away with him.  Goodbye.
He's naked.  He's not even wearing sunglasses!
I just remembered, we forgot our cooler.
Squabblers miss the Sasquatch.
We can keep going - I told him we forgot our cell phone chargers too.
He's going to check on table availability at the Trump Hof 2000 meters further up
He thinks he saw the Singing Nun.
He's as real as your self-confidence.
He says he just loved our sunglasses. I told him where he can get 50% off.
Which jacket brand do you think that guy
Yeti or bigfoot?
This was your idea in the first place, I am going back down
HIS FEET ARE REALLY NOT THAT BIG
He's heading north for the winter.
Yes, I’m going with him, believe it or not we’ve been seeing each other “on and off” for many years now.
Sorry. I know he goes both ways, but he's MINE!
He said he didn't care to be associated with fashion as primitive as transition lenses.
Are you my ride down?
I told you, we shouldn't have shaved this morning.
Remember no selfies!
I’m not packing that out.
Good news, darling, I've got custody of the kids !
Are you going to just stand there holding your stick and prove my mother right, or are you going to grow some hair and get up that hill?
He’s going to take us to his leader.
Perhaps I should have called him just 'Denominable' instead.
How can he not wear sunglasses?
Let’s give it five minutes then pretend we’re two different people.
So where do we get that kind of gear?
I'm leaving you for a real woman.
He's going back to get me the recipe for mountain oysters
It's called a Trumpsie.
I told you this would be an abominable climb
Hopefully you stopped at the latrine in basecamp.
Yeti schneit, when I am getting a ring?
Yes, Ted. I will marry him because I love him.
Load the gun.
Have you spotted him yet?
And you thought I smelled abominable!
I can tell you this: he certainly knows his "ups and downs" in more ways than one.
He says you're the one that forgot the crampons.
It's not because he's a Yeti; that's prejudiced. I don't trust him as our guide because he doesn't have the proper gear.
He wanted bigger residuals.
Frank just doesn’t understand my puns. “Yeti” will in the future.
He has to go yeti.
Look, no one's perfect but could you please stop calling him "abominable" and talking about the size of his feet?
YET-I should have known, "Love 'em and leave 'em.
I snuck a peek. It's one of those "Red Rocket" things.
I think he's pretty hot!
Because it was there.  How about you?
Trump's in the orange coat.
I want a fur coat in the same material he is wearing.
Invasion of the hipsters.
I asked him where he bought his coat and he spit out "Female".
I don't know where he's going, but the last guy who followed him was never seen again!
I think his four star Yelp rating is over generous, frankly.
Really? All I see is a man who takes too many bathroom breaks.
Hiker 1: He said his name is Darwin. 
Hiker 2: I didn't know you spoke Yeti!
Are you sure there is no
Starbucks??
It's the only place where he can get shoes in his size.
'No, I said I couldn't stand _your_ back hair.'
What do you mean I have big feet?!
"Yes, he may be warmer, but I bet you he doesn't have a GPS."
You are the most abominable man I've ever seen!
So THAT’S what Yeti pubes look like!
What type of reality is at the top?
I think it's time to tell him he's lost control of that holiday beard.
Celebrity or not!!!!!
We are not following “Mr. Bigfoot” to the ends of the earth.
And I wouldn't put it past him.
I'm sorry Dave, I'm going with him. 
I'm not attracted to you anymore and I find him irresistible.
He said his name was Zarathustra!
And Yet-I told he exists and you doubted as usual.
We have to stop meeting like this.
No, I do not think this is proof of the Stoned Ape theory.
Its impossible getting a close shave up here.
He wants to know if we can make the shoe as an extra large.

Like I TOLD you... Just 'cause it rhymes, he still wouldn't appreciate spaghetti!
My husband has a right to exercise like everyone else!
I feel capable of summiting, YET I have a foreboding sense of some fantastic beast beating us to the top.

He said that he heard: The bear went over the mountain.
No point in climbing up there, there's no Yeti's in sight.
He's called Bigfoot for a reason!
We both are nuts. You follow the Yeti. Yet, I follow you!
Well of course you want to go tell everyone, but his natural habitat resides in only the minds of seemingly crazy conspiracy theorists. Be considerate and protect endangered species.
Marry you?  Not Yeti!
It's a living!
He said he was a casualty of the Blue Wave.
Uncle Charlie is showing us up again!
Forget the summit! Reaching base camp was hairy enough!
I can't find my white cane anywhere
He said the furry convention is already full
I'm sorry, but now that I've seen what true hairiness is I can't call you Harry anymore.  Goodbye Bob.
What? You said you wanted a Yeti for Christmas.
After fifty years of climbing,Bob just doesn't like working as part of a team.
Dad forgot the keys again.
Time passes very slowly up at the top.
He climbs a lot faster than you do!
I just don't believe in Bigfoot.
At the top of the most remote mountain on the continent I have the dumb luck to hike right into the path of Rick Walters! Wow!
He's upset because we didn't wear the matching Yeti costumes as promised.
Seriously, you need to do something about that B.O. problem.
Wow! I can't believe it!  All I need to do is look at my glasses to read texts!
Great! You just had to say "they do smell bad on the outside" .  Now we'll get no help from him!
Well, of course, as soon as I saw that he wasn't wearing Gucci loafers, I lost all interest in him.
He prefers a well beaten path.
Baby, it’s cold outside.
He didn't respond, so do we know any names besides Yeti?
His fingers are really big.
You went with 'abominable?'
So you found a copy of Sibelius' 8th Symphony? I don't believe it.
No, just a local with a somewhat less-than-ideal penchant for cleanliness.
Thank God.  I couldn't take the smell.
He claims to be an 18-EEEEEE.
He's in a hurry to see what he can see.
Nice enough guy, but I think he "OD"ed on the supplemental testosterone.
Mike, your vanishing aloofness is a downer.  His is so hot.
I 'm coming from the electrolysis.
What did you have to tell him to check his straight white hirsute privilege for?
Last one up the mountain is a Sasquatch!
I simply asked if he was here to deliver lunch and he simply answered, “Not yet.”
You say abominable, I say atomical. What's the difference? They're both big.
He didn't seem interested in my recommended haberdasher.
Why are we stopping?  I've got a pain in my abominable area!
That guy looks like my dad.

He’s warm blooded unlike us humans
I told you he didn't like egg salad!
He's going to let us leave unharmed, but he's still sore that you swiped his name to use for your cooler and tumbler company
Come with us! He says we can party with Rudolph and Yukon Cornelius!
It's all down hill from here.
He takes bigger steps.
True, yet I wasn't scared and Yeti wasn't scared.
He seems a bit backward to me.
He’s indubitably abdominal.
His manners are abominable!
His day rate is triple union scale, and he doesn't do his own stunts.
I don't think my cane is puny.
I'm in love with him John!
The hirsute branch of the family is hoping you might grow a beard for the wedding.
Some people are so unprepared.
He was looking for his yeti.
Sure we had our differences, I grew up on the upper east side, he is a product of nature, but somehow we made it work and were a couple, but then he gave me the cold shoulder when I called him 'abominable!'
I think he will beat us to the top
He is from Ancestry - he is my relative not yours!
No obstacle is too great, Yet I will climb this mountain.
I should have brought that granola bar.
What do you mean you forgot the condom?!

He said it's a few miles to the top.  He also said to holler if we needed help getting back down.
The transaction costs are a pain, but the nice thing about cryptidcurrency is that it's very hard to trace.
But I don't have goals!
He says he's looking for Noah's lost Ark.
Twenty-five steaks and he makes me pay the bill--That’s the last date I have with that abomination!
Yes, my husband Harry does wear a size 18 shoe.
You heard Dad: either come home clean or don't come home at all. Start walking

He’s great.  You only need 1 Sherpa for the entire brigade plus he even has a Michelin star!
I meant bring the 'cooler' Frank.

We're safe as long as it thinks we are talking politics

By asking directions to the top of the mountain, the Yeti is polite if not smart.
I thought you said it was all uphill from here!
You have to admire his ability to avoid those awkward small-talk walk-bys at the office.
Hipsters ruin everything.
They say he slept next to a woman for thirty years but never had sex with her. It drove him to politics.
Yeti don't think it's a figment of my imagination.
The food and drink are worth the hike, but it's just not my kind of crowd!
I wish we could get a signal up here, because I'm pretty sure a Yeti is GM's version of the Tesla.

He didn't like the Smallfoot movie so he won't take us to his village.
I think he's on the wrong mountain.
I came here for exotic viewing- not exotic mooning!"
Adam Moakher, Oakland C
I think Santa needs to shave”
Mutha fucker said Patagonia was for weenies!!!!
Turn around and follow our cross fit instructor.
So I heard that there was a really hairy man pretending he is big foot, around here .
I said, "Have you heard of #MeToo?", and he turned on his heels.
Apparently he's sick of everyone Messin' with Sasquatch.
I said “Do Not follow the Yeti”!!
About time he loped in-focus.
My estate is not ready for probate.
I hear a Yeti's inner temperature always stays the same
The big snowball fell off his back.
Nobody told him November ended two months ago.
He's pissed. He still hasn't received his comped Rambler Tumbler.
The Schoen-Rene Caption on the boxing-gloved pianist was  better!
What in the world did he eat? Breathing at these elevations is never THIS hard.
Some of our old travel companions got a little too invested.
Not interested, but he said the White House might try Bigfoot.
Let's ask if he knows the way to the abominable snowman.
He asked if we'd seen Jill . . . yeti.
Are you still sold on all our gear
I forget my camera.  I think I'll have to head down.
Just don't offer him oatmeal.
Because, Brett, those are incredibly offensive names.  And the Journey song is tired.
I told you my feet were too small for this climb.
He groped me !
Well, Jacques-o, what's next for you?

Jacques LaFleur: I don't know. There's always Loch Ness.

[Both laugh]
I wonder why they call him the Abdominal Snowman?
Honey look, our cooler can walk!
Yeti-r you go again, on with the yeti jokes.
I can't even with you guys right now...
His positive attitude will help him seek great heights.
He said his name is Abominable.
Had me fooled,thought for sure he'd want our peanut butter.
You know that's not the direction to the up-town R train.
You’ll never guess where they got the name!
You shouldn't have asked him if he went an Ivy League School!
His family has been climbing this mountain for centuries. You' d think they's be bored by now.
Didnt you forget something...like  our skis.



Elizabeth Shaw, San Francisco. CA.
Did you have to tell him that we'd meet him up there later? I have no more big foot cookies.
Where did you say you saw the bigfoot?
He said, "Send a paparazzi dog and I'll talk."
This is a great spot for our new headquarters
It's bald.
I tried but I can’t keep up with him.
Starbucks is down the mountain, not up.
Really, he’s not so, just abominable P.R.
I already don't want to carry my own crap - now I have to carry his too?
Wow, those sure look like big footsteps to follow in."
"I know -- and he's not even wearing socks!"
He said, "Stick with me, and I'll make you the smartest kid on this mountain!"
Take a picture, it'll last longer creep! - I have a boyfriend.
You offended him with your ape jealousy
He said there's a Starbucks about a mile back. He knew a shortcut and they'll never see us coming.
I hope he uses toilet paper
Yes, his name is Eddie Moretti. Yes, he likes spaghetti. But he is clearly a SASQUATCH.
Damn that guy needs something...maybe a haircut...I don't know...
He said he's slouching. Where's Bethlehem?
Honey, I told you we shouldn't have left without a compass; how
just how far have we walked?"
He asked if he should expect a coffee shop to follow.
Is this slope for ski-dating or Tindering?
Really? That's the view? Both Matt Whitaker and Denver Riggleman recommended this hike . . .
The Yeti is despondent as the LBGQ said it can not be a member.
Look, I know we just met him, but I do think it's best if I go up with him alone because of his fear of numbers."
He said that he's going on ahead to ward off all the troubles and worries of our endangered generation.
His name is Yentl Yeti but he won't take a selfie with me!
Oh ya, the ranger did say they were bringing in path clearing equipment.
He said don't go on Wolverton Mountain.
Are we supposed to be blind, or is it just bright?
I was young and innocent,but now I have found my dream,Captain Von T.
I’m thinking if we follow him we may never be seen again!!
He says if we don’t leave his land, he’s will kick our asses !
Yukon Yeti Yogi Yahoo
He/She may be abominable but, is great if you need a hand or something warm to hold onto.
You gotta come through me to get through him!!
The Hair Unapparent
I guess they didn’t wear hats back then.
All right, have it your way—you heard a yeti lament!
I want to live the hairy life
Remember,I told you to buy that suit last week?"
I didn't mean to offend. Everyone likes snowball sandwiches!
Odd, he asked me to call him a Yeber.
Whatever you do, don't make any sudden bowel movements.
Do you think he got his outfit at Sports Authority?
Hello, I'm following a big giant. I want to see what he's up to.
I counted eight passes of the basketball.  How about you?
maybe the Donald will get us there
Yeah, you have just spotted a real trail legend; thru-hikes this peak barely leaving a footprint
I told you we were close to the hot springs!
The mountain would not come to Monster Erotica.
I told you not to bring your brother along—his personality is too big.
Your hiking skills are an obination !
He's an agent and he wants to make us rich and famous.
Wow. I can't believe that the legendary monster known as the Yeti or Abominable Snowman is standing right behind me. This just goes to show that anything can happen when you climb mountains.
I expected Naples to be warmer.
Yes that really was him!  I thought for a while that we were an item but he said he just couldn't stand my tiny feet.
I have a hard time keeping up... my feet aren’t as big.
I don't care what kind of trail etiquette your ex has.
What a waste. His feet isn’t really all that big.
The weather up there is abominable!
I'm going to get my back blown out by a Yeti that's where I'm going!
You smelling that? He’s leaving a downwind gas trail of garlic pepper beef jerkey!
He lives around here somewhere around here.
He aid there is nothing up there but angst.
These shades are really dark.
I checked.  There weren't any listings for "excellent" snowmen.
Do you have the Age?
This is abominable. What took you so long?
He just said,’Please get out of my way and go on back down.’
You have angered my father, Gornak, son of Tetow. He will never support out union now!
No matter how high that Yeti climbs, his inside temperature is always the same.
Bigfoot is wearing the latest in thermal wear.
Is it me... or did steve forget to shave again?
I tell you -  I'm seeing things"
No point to get civilised - these guys can't even agree on continuing resolution
He thinks he'll win, but he doesn't have the right clothing.
Man says,
"You think you're sharp, just because your head comes to a point"
These new sunglasses block 100% AS rays.
Please stay. I beg you not to cro!
I told you his brain isn't big enough to know that passing in the right lane is illegal.
Is that you walking away from me?
Just the beauty of Father Nature...
Maybe if we follow in his big foot prints we can keep-up.
Cranston Now youttps://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/contest#thisweek
You think you’re smarter than everybody else! You don’t even know which way is up!” [Underscore the word "up"
You're so insecure, no one can stand to be around you.
Why won't you believe me?  What we saw in that lake was the Loch Ness!
Go away. Leave me alone. I want to explore this mountain in my own.
#MeTwoDegrees
I just realized I forgot my YETI at home.
Have you seen any Yeti?
No, not yet.
I feel like in a movie... don’t you?
You’re acting abominably.
He said he’s just getting back from his holiday vacation on the island of misfit toys.
Yeti pubes, dude. Now we know
I would rather marry big foot than you!
He's says he gets clothes right now, or he walks for good.
Argue, argue, argue!
He forgot his pajamas.
He said the nudist colony is an EEO.
Speaking of which, my new boss is an abominable.
The sooner we get to the top the sooner we turn back into fish!
He  says we are approaching the Upland  border where clothes   are  not allowed. and everyone  fury.
He said what I am wearing is way out of style--what an abominable comment!
I think your fruitless pursuit is an abomination.
Are you Yeti to continue or not?
There's nothing funny here, so please step back.
He said Survivor need to talk to his agent.
He's got great snow shoes"
That's the hairy guy I've been lookin' for, I'm going after him!
I told you it was a great idea to recreate the movie BirdBox with these shades on
It looks like we should ditch the jackets and get fur coats instead.
You look dazed and confused.
Let's keep our eyes wide open for any hint of HIS presence!
It's the abominable impeached-man on the way to his final summit with Kim Jong-um.
I knew all those hiking lessons were a crock of shit
Cool, I wasn’t aware that A.I. had created a new climbing solution.
Says he' can't miss showdown with 'biggest, best,' etc."
I just met Bigfoot and he thanked me for looking in on his wife.
You might say I saved the last dance for you.
He said that he's looking for a shoe store that carries extra wide sizes.
Do you think he needs crampons
Well, if you weren't so stubborn.
He’s not sociable,yet,I think I heard him grunt.
I think our guide's lunch might have been braised rabbit in garlic sauce.
I'm leaving you, Chad. I'm only into Bigfoot cock now.
It's an experiment to determine if he can replace snow groooming equipment.
OH MY GOSH! JANET! BEHIND YOU! DO YOU SEE THAT?



It's a woman.
No, he's the "abdominble" snowman!
You get the spray tan, I’ll get the rope.
Oh it  is just another ordinary mountain to climb.
He said “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.” It’s time for you to turn back, John.
fuck shi t fuckfuck shit .. fuck
I dunno. He just fast-talked something like “Hillary, stop following me”, “hell freezes over”, and the “fastest most beautiful path to Kremlin anyone on earth has ever seen”.    PG
Can you believe the New Yorker tried to scam me for $120 bucks after the trial p eriod, what a pack of cocksuckers...duck The New Yorker..BITCH
Why'd you have to Bigfoot our decision to peacefully hike to the summit?
Woman, everything is an uphill battle with you. Just put one foot before the other.
I know he can't help it with the altitude and all, but I'm eve-level with his ass and I'm going to get pink eye before we summit.
We go now, we catch the draft.
He made a pass at me !
If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.
Any snow up there?
I’m trying to climb -with a primate
I'm thinking of trading my Canada Goose Down for a Yeti Fur.
He loves a good freeze dried chicken tetrazzini that feeds EIGHT.
No dice. They just showed me their copy of an Injunction Against Harassment.
Hmmph--peakbagger.
What do you mean, “we can’t follow him, he’s not wearing sunglasses”..?
H'm I thought I heard something. Oh well, it must be the wind... or a fat gorilla yelling
Each time he goes up, he complains about a missing rock.
I've just been YETTI-IZED!
Give me that stick; I am going to follow him.
That guy thinks he’s so much cooler than us because his feet are bigger than oura
He's in a hurry to get to the sock hop dance...
1st place is a thick wool pair...
OK, its true...I’m going with him because your #metoo backpack
I wonder where he got those sturdy boots from.
For avalanche sake!  He should be packing a transmitter, snow shovel and probe.  He can’t expect 911 out here.
The Abominable Snowman is a myth, like having to wear a jacket when you climb a mountain.
"He said he likes to come up her for his privacy"
It’s amazing what evolution can do when you can’t get to the summit for 20yrs
I accidentally called him Abdominable Snowman and he's sensitive about his weight.
I think it’s that Ultralight Fur Yeti-Ready model?
You'll never get up there without the right gear.
you should have given him your call card
He must be really piss off
It's about The Quatch on the mountain
There goes the neighborhood. They let up here these days ...
Do you think we should go back to that look?
I did not have sex with him!
It's Sasquash's summit home
He says someone put steroids on his only razor
So... that part about the rest of our days together... we're still good, yeah?
It's an old world up there!
Sorry.  He's turn down his visit with Bigfoot.
Now is the time to try your new battery razor.
Keep looking I'm sure we can pick its' traks up again.
I don't care if the haute route is on your bucket list I'm going to the maibeau spa to warm up.
He promised he'd write every day!
Sometimes, my imagination is lazy and only walks wild.
Cuddling, that's where it is!
Qianlong Ping
it's fur coat seson
No.  He was just merely awful.

Jeff Tillotson
Dallas, Texas
jtillotson100@gmail.com
He said even though he has a Bigfoot he jogs like this every morning
He said," Look at this mountain; it's fabulous.  The guy who put this together did a wonderful job."
Where's a camera when you need one?    Small foot exists!
Hey, let's follow his trail to the top!
He's on a mission
The surprise is better when he starts it higher up!
He didn't know you have to be thirteen to enter and vote.
Sunglasses.
My jeans got spliced.
Hillary Clinton made deals with yetis to rig the election!
He’s not down with pegging, which I totally respect, but you know I need to dominate our plus ones like that in a threesome context or I can’t climax.
Look! What`s down there?
Let’s catch up. I’ve always to stand on the shoulders of a giant.
He : You could’ve frozen to death - you left camp without your parka ?
She : Why, that strong Yetti carried me in his arms & kept me cuddled warm.... he was more of a gentleman than you are, my dear !
I'd heard that antique fur is all the rage on the slopes!
I've heard time travel happens in high altitude.
Oats not what he said, it’s how he said it
Didn’t we meet in Istanbul?
Going up,that guy does not leaven tracks
Stanislaw Szudkalaki told me you would be here
I told you we didn't need backpacks.
where's that can of paint you brought
We’re not there yet, but the Yetty is!
A Big Foot!! I want to get a selfe!!!
What a surprise seeing you here!  I keep seeing some of strangest things on this adventure, and I'm becoming convinced that just about everyone passes through this place.
With those feet, he can climb faster, farther, and higher - and the natural fur provides good insulation against the cold.
I think I saw that Yeti somewhere around here.
He was “snow bathing.” His clothes are on the summit.
Bryan Mattimore
Stamford, CT
Bmattimore@growth-Engine.com
I think he lost his Knapsack
DOH, how would he know about copyright infringement?
Are you the one who just tweeted that he was abominable?  Come with me for your public shaming.  You can't escape the twitter-police.
Watch it!   It's the Abdominal Snowman  a.k.a. Abominable Snowman or Yeti.
He said he'll be right back...forgot his Depends
I thought we were on a date far from the maddening crowd!
Was that a yeti or hairy man.
Patrick McGuire Waldorf MD
He may be abominable, but at least he’s hairy!
I told you not to forget the car keys
Places!
I
With your feet, I'm not sure if that guy behind us really is Big Foot.

He has left us, quitting the Himalayan guide. He tweeted "A Yeti would not be a sucker any more!"
I gave it to Dad. He needed a toothpick.
He says distant planetoid Ultima Thule is snowman.
It's Bubba's neanderthal brain that bothers me.
Of course we'd find a Yeti in a trackless waste.
Just because you're tired is snow reason to act abominably!
"Tool use was not yet considered to be such a big deal."
Maybe you should tell him there's nothing up!
I realize this is a different time zone , but this is rediculous.
I thought I smelt something funny.
That jerk ever hear of trail etiquette...didn
Cat Man Does
Shitcock.
I told you we didn't need four different kinds of Swiss army knives!
Really ? You asked him why he wasn
I said: d“Are you Yeti or Yeren?” And he said:“Buzz off, little girl.”
Yet I can’t slow down.
It's over George. The Hairy Behemoth looks pretty good now!
"Pessimist"!  "Optimist"
I think I'm beginning to come on.
Yes he's shy around people and hates snow,Yeti visits the mountain regularly.
''Quick, don't lose him, Nirvana awaits."
He forgot to get his other outfit when he changed into his fur suit.
He suggested we invest in pet food.
I'm sorry we have to break up, turns out we are prime soul mates.
He's asked me to marry him and have little foots with him."
susan knickerbocker, Whidbey Islan
When I asked for the time, I didn't mean shadow time, dumbass!
I understand you got a hole in one, but you have to give back the ball AND the little pencil.
Hey, I thought it will be a private hiking trip on a remote mountain.  I don't want to be bothered by a furry giant, and who knows, he may unzip his costume when he gets hot, and  who knows what's inside the suit?
Perhaps we should take a real low-tech approach to this crazed climb?
Yes, it really is Sasquatch!
I just told him it wasn't there, but....
The altitude is starting to get into my head but it’s not affecting my nose,that thing stunk like Yeti Shit!!!
Don't look now but that guy's got a mountain hanging out his arse
I wonder if people are right that there is a big foot. Only if we could see we might could have been famus.
I’m convinced he’s Alpha Yeti. 
He likes alphabet soup, 
short rhymes, acronyms, 
Writing And Reading Poop!
He's an abominable snowman who really likes mountain climbing.
T-shirts, boxer shorts, … ; everybody thinks he’s sold out.
Hey, is that our little Junior? Ten years can sure do a lot.
Is it me or is there a hairy elephant in the room
God said, "I only came down to share a message with my children: "I don't have big feet as many of you seem to imply".
This is an abominable floor plan.
Excuse me, are you Han Solo
Yayo Antioch ca
Yes, I saw him too, but my camera phone battery was frozen. Why did I ever let you convince to drive my new Tesla today? We're totally screwed!
Follow him!  He doesn't even have an EMS logo on his body
Guess he missed out on the holiday clothing sales
I wish that I was as great at climbing as Fred over there.
Now see what Yeti does!
Suggesting that apply to be a contestant on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is leading, Mark. He's a Yeti; he's not stupid.
Nephilim schmefelim.  Get back to camp.  Your breakfast is getting cold.
They shave everything from under the nose to the top of the toes, then cover with manufactured clothes....and they call me "Big Foot"-I call you "Big Footprint" you dangerous creatures (smh)
So who were you with, really?  And don't tell me it must have been the next yeti over!
what if I’m the mosterrrr that’s been here all along...
Are you the Ice-Ghost of Christmas Past or Christmas Present? 
The Ice-Ghost of Christmas Future has already climbed ahead!
Don’t worry. He’s not going to eat us! Do you think the laxative- filled brownies we scattered along the trail did the trick?
As Adam and Eve trekked up the mountain, they couldn't help but notice God's new creature. The Yetti.
He has an advertiser’s attitude toward hairy climbs.
Good call ditching the cell phones-- otherwise we'd never bring him back to the fold.
On the summit assault it's every Snowman for himself.
Safe guide maybe, but we enjoy our freedom, and I don’t want an abominable child.
He says he left his favorite Yeti at the top.
Me neither!
Is that donkey kong over there?
I told that The North Face jackets would not keep us warm.
Bubble tea? Oh yeah!
Do you think that I shoukd give him my beautician phone number?
He really deserves a good hairs removal !!!
Free hiking!
The amount of litter on the trail is abominable! I tend to notice those things.
What makes you think this is a renovated windmill?
Move. I’m a Republican. I’m a Democrat.
He's not very fast
A I glad that there is NO Television up here!
He said that a “T” is out of the question.
Why did you wax your back hair?
So, Smallfoot does exist, and is well on his way up the (food) chain.
That bearish man will be alone at the white top there!
Look, it's Uncle Fred!
I just came down from up there , it's an emptey house .
That’s the guy who fell off the mountain because he wouldn’t get out of the way.
"He mentioned something about a bomb and a bull..."
Is the shoe store this way?
I think we are really really
Who is him called? My roommate.
I thought we were meeting up for ice cream
He can’t decide if he has sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, but he just keeps climbing.
He makes your grouping seem like...
They are lyrics! "It's only a paper moon."
I told ya! Yeti! This sonovabitch!
Zendaya is Meechee
This is better than anything seen on the 'Finding Bigfoot' series. We really HAVE found him!
Did you notice the really neat outfit  the big
The price is miniature
The stressed is so "Bad' in the world. "you or me " did not see(BIG )( "FOOT)
